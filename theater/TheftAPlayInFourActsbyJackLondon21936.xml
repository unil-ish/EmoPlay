    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Margaret Chalmers . Twenty-seven years of age ; a strong , mature woman , but quite feminine where her heart or sense of beauty are concerned . Her eyes are wide apart . Has a dazzling smile , which she knows how to use on occasion . Also , on occasion , she can be firm and hard , even cynical An intellectual woman , and at the same time a very womanly woman , capable of sudden tendernesses , flashes of emotion , and abrupt actions . She is a finished product of high culture and refinement , and at the same time possesses robust vitality and instinctive right-promptings that augur well for the future of the race</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Howard Knox . He might have been a poet , but was turned politician . Inflamed with love for humanity . Thirty-five years of age . He has his vision , and must follow it . He has suffered ostracism because of it , and has followed his vision in spite of abuse and ridicule . Physically , a well-built , powerful man . Strong-featured rather than handsome . Very much in earnest , and , despite his university training , a trifle awkward in carriage and demeanor , lacking in social ease . He has been elected to Congress on a reform ticket , and is almost alone in fight he is making . He has no party to back him , though he has a following of a few independents and insurgents</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Thomas Chalmers . Forty-five to fifty years of age . Iron-gray mustache . Slightly stout . A good liver , much given to Scotch and soda , with a weak heart . Is liable to collapse any time . If anything , slightly lazy or lethargic in his emotional life . One of the “ owned ” senators representing a decadent New England state , himself master of the state political machine . Also , he is nobody 's fool . He possesses the brain and strength of character to play his part . His most distinctive feature is his temperamental opportunism</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Master Thomas Chalmers . Six years of age . Sturdy and healthy despite his grandmother 's belief to the contrary</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Ellery Jackson Hubbard . Thirty-eight to forty years of age . Smooth-shaven . A star journalist with a national reputation ; a large , heavy-set man , with large head , large hands — everything about him is large . A man radiating prosperity , optimism and selfishness . Has no morality whatever . Is a conscious individualist , cold-blooded , pitiless , working only for himself , and believing in nothing but himself</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Anthony Starkweather . An elderly , well preserved gentleman , slenderly built , showing all the signs of a man who has lived clean and has been almost an ascetic . One to whom the joys of the flesh have had little meaning . A cold , controlled man whose one passion is for power . Distinctively a man of power . An eagle-like man , who , by keenness of brain and force of character , has carved out a fortune of hundreds of millions . In short , an industrial and financial magnate of the first water and of the finest type to be found in the United States . Essentially a moral man , his rigid New England morality has suffered a sea change and developed into the morality of the master-man of affairs , equally rigid , equally uncompromising , but essentially Jesuitical in that he believes in doing wrong that right may come of it . He is absolutely certain that civilization and progress rest on his shoulders and upon the shoulders of the small group of men like him</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Mrs. Starkweather . Of the helpless , comfortably stout , elderly type . She has not followed her husband in his moral evolution . She is the creature of old customs , old prejudices , old New England ethics . She is rather confused by the modern rush of life</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Connie Starkweather . Margaret 's younger sister , twenty years old . She is nothing that Margaret is , and everything that Margaret is not . No essential evil in her , but has no mind of her own — hopelessly a creature of convention . Gay , laughing , healthy , buxom — a natural product of her care-free environment</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Feux Dobleman . Private secretary to Anthony Starkweather . A young man of correct social deportment , thoroughly and in all things just the sort of private secretary a man like Anthony Starkweather would have . He is a weak-souled creature , timorous , almost effeminate</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Linda Davis . Maid to Margaret . A young woman of twenty-five or so , blond , Scandinavian , though American-born . A cold woman , almost featureless because of her long years of training , but with a hot heart deep down , and characterized by an intense devotion to her mistress . Wild horses could drag nothing from her where her mistress is concerned</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Junus Rutland . Having no strong features about him</role>
     <roleDesc>the type realizes itself</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>John Gifford . A labor agitator . A man of the people , rough-hewn , narrow as a labor-leader may well be , earnest and sincere . He is a proper , better type of labor-leader</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Matsu Sakari . Secretary of Japanese Embassy . He is the perfection of politeness and talks classical book-English . He bows a great deal</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Dolores Ortega . Wife of Peruvian Minister ; bright and vivacious</role>
     <roleDesc>and uses her hands a great deal as she talks , in the Latin-American fashion</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Senator Dowsett . Fifty years of age ; well preserved</role>

    <stage type="setting">
     <head>A ROOM IN THE HOUSE OF SENATOR CHALMERS</head>
     <stage>Scene . In Senator Chalmers ’ home . It is four o'clock in the afternoon , in a modern living room with appropriate furnishings . In particular , in front , on left , a table prepared for the serving of tea , all excepting the tea urn itself . At rear , right of center , is main entrance to the room . Also , doorways at sides , on left and right . Curtain discloses Chalmers and Hubbard seated loungingly at the right front .</stage>
    </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Hubbard }</speaker>
     <p><stage>After an apparent pause for cogitation .</stage>I can n't understand why an old wheel-horse like Elsworth should kick over the traces that way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Chalmers }</speaker>
     <p>Disgruntled . Thinks he did n't get his fair share of plums out of the Tariff Committee . Besides , it 's his last term . He 's announced that he 's going to retire .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Hubbard }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Snorting contemptuously , mimicking an old man 's pompous enunciation .</stage>“ A Resolution to Investigate the High Cost of Living ! ” — old Senator Elsworth introducing a measure like that ! The old buck !—— How are you going to handle it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Chalmers }</speaker>
     <p>It 's already handled .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Hubbard }</speaker>
     <p>Yes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Chalmers }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pulling his mustache .</stage>Turned it over to the Committee to Audit and Control the Contingent Expenses of the Senate .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Hubbard }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Grinning his appreciation .</stage>And you 're chairman . Poor old Elsworth . This way to the lethal chamber , and the bill 's on its way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Chalmers }</speaker>
     <p>Elsworth will be retired before it 's ever reported . In the meantime , say after a decent interval , Senator Hodge will introduce another resolution to investigate the high cost of living . It will be like Elsworth 's , only it wo n't .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Hubbard }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Nodding his head and anticipating .</stage>And it will go to the Committee on Finance and come back for action inside of twenty-four hours .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Chalmers }</speaker>
     <p>By the way , I see Cartwright 's Magazine has ceased muck-raking .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Hubbard }</speaker>
     <p>Cartwrights never did muck-rake — that is , not the big Interests — only the small independent businesses that did n't advertise .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Chalmers }</speaker>
     <p>Yes , it deftly concealed its reactionary tendencies .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Hubbard }</speaker>
     <p>And from now on the concealment will be still more deft . I 've gone into it myself . I have a majority of the stock right now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Chalmers }</speaker>
     <p>I thought I had noticed a subtle change in the last two numbers .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Hubbard }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Nodding .</stage>We 're still going on muck-raking . We have a splendid series on Aged Paupers , demanding better treatment and more sanitary conditions . Also we are going to run “ Barbarous Venezuela ” and show up thoroughly the rotten political management of that benighted country .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Chalmers }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Nods approvingly , and , after a pause .</stage>And now concerning Knox . That 's what I sent for you about . His speech comes off tomorrow per schedule . At last we 've got him where we want him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Hubbard }</speaker>
     <p>I have the ins and outs of it pretty well . Everything 's arranged . The boys have their cue , though they do n't know just what 's going to be pulled off ; and this time to-morrow afternoon their dispatches will be singing along the wires .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Chalmers }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Firmly and harshly .</stage>This man Knox must be covered with ridicule , swamped with ridicule , annihilated with ridicule .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Hubbard }</speaker>
     <p>It is to laugh . Trust the great American people for that . We 'll make those little Western editors sit up . They 've been swearing by Knox , like a little tin god . Roars of laughter for them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Chalmers }</speaker>
     <p>Do you do anything yourself ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Hubbard }</speaker>
     <p>Trust me . I have my own article for Cartwright 's blocked out . They 're holding the presses for it . I shall wire it along hot-footed to-morrow evening . Say ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Chalmers }</speaker>
     <p><stage>After a pause .</stage>Well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Hubbard }</speaker>
     <p>Was n't it a risky thing to give him his chance with that speech ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Chalmers }</speaker>
     <p>It was the only feasible thing . He never has given us an opening . Our service men have camped on his trail night and day . Private life as unimpeachable as his public life . But now is our chance . The gods have given him into our hands . That speech will do more to break his influence —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Hubbard }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Interrupting .</stage>Than a Fairbanks cocktail .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Both laugh . ) But do n't forget that this Knox is a live wire . Somebody might get stung . Are you sure , when he gets up to make that speech , that he wo n't be able to back it up ?</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Chalmers }</speaker>
     <p>No danger at all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Hubbard }</speaker>
     <p>But there are hooks and crooks by which facts are sometimes obtained .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Chalmers }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Positively .</stage>Knox has nothing to go on but suspicions and hints , and unfounded assertions from the yellow press .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Man-servant enters , goes to tea-table , looks it over , and makes slight rearrangements . ) ( Lowering his voice . ) He will make himself a laughing stock . His charges will turn into boomerangs . His speech will be like a sheet from a Sunday supplement , with not a fact to back it up . ( Glances at Servant . ) We 'd better be getting out of here . They 're going to have tea .</stage>
    <stage>The Servant , however , makes exit . ) Come to the library and have a high-ball . ( They pause as Hubbard speaks .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Hubbard }</speaker>
     <p><stage>With quiet glee .</stage>And to-morrow Ali Baba gets his .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Chalmers }</speaker>
     <p>Ali Baba ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Hubbard }</speaker>
     <p>That 's what your wife calls him — Knox .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Chalmers }</speaker>
     <p>Oh , yes , I believe I 've heard it before . It 's about time he hanged himself , and now we 've given him the rope .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Hubbard }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sinking voice and becoming deprecatingly confidential .</stage>Oh , by the way , just a little friendly warning , Senator Chalmers . Not so fast and loose up New York way . That certain lady , not to be mentioned — there 's gossip about it in the New York newspaper offices . Of course , all such stories are killed . But be discreet , be discreet If Gherst gets hold of it , he 'll play it up against the Administration in all his papers .<stage>Chalmers , who throughout this speech is showing a growing resentment , is about to speak , when voices are heard without and he checks himself .</stage><stage>Enter . Mrs. Starkweather , rather flustered and imminently in danger of a collapse , followed by Connie Starkweather , fresh , radiant , and joyous .</stage>{ Mrs. Starkweather }</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>With appeal and relief .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Oh —— Tom !</speaker>
     <p><stage>Chalmers takes her hand sympathetically and protectingly .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Connie }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Who is an exuberant young woman , bursts forth .</stage>Oh , brother-in-law ! Such excitement ! That 's what 's the matter with mother . We ran into a go-cart . Our chauffeur was not to blame . It was the woman 's fault . She tried to cross just as we were turning the corner . But we hardly grazed it . Fortunately the baby was not hurt — only spilled . It was ridiculous .<stage>Catching sight of Hubbard .</stage>Oh , there you are , Mr. Hubbard . How de do .<stage>Steps half way to meet him and shakes hands with him .</stage><stage>Mrs. Starkweather looks around helplessly for a chair , and Chalmers conducts her to one soothingly .</stage>{ Mrs. Starkweather } Oh , it was terrible ! The little child might have been killed . And such persons love their babies , I know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Connie }</speaker>
     <p><stage>To Chalmers .</stage>Has father come ? We were to pick him up here . Where 's Madge ? { Mrs. Starkweather }</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Espying Hubbard , faintly . ) Oh , there is Mr. Hubbard .</stage>
    <stage>Hubbard comes to her and shakes hands . ) I simply can n't get used to these rapid ways of modern life . The motor-car is the invention of the devil . Everything is too quick . When I was a girl , we lived sedately , decorously . There was time for meditation and repose . But in this age there is time for nothing . How Anthony keeps his head is more than I can understand . But , then , Anthony is a wonderful man .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Hubbard }</speaker>
     <p>I am sure Mr. Starkweather never lost his head in his life .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Chalmers }</speaker>
     <p>Unless when he was courting you , mother . { Mrs. Starkweather }</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>A trifle grimly . ) I 'm not so sure about that .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Connie }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Imitating a grave , business-like enunciation .</stage>Father probably conferred first with his associates , then turned the affair over for consideration by his corporation lawyers , and , when they reported no flaws , checked the first spare half hour in his notebook to ask mother if she would have him .<stage>They laugh .</stage>And looked at his watch at least twice while he was proposing . { Mrs. Starkweather } Anthony was not so busy then as all that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Hubbard }</speaker>
     <p>He had n't yet taken up the job of running the United States . { Mrs. Starkweather } I 'm sure I do n't know what he is running , but he is a very busy man — business , politics , and madness ; madness , politics , and business .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She stops breathlessly and glances at tea-table . ) Tea . I should like a cup of tea . Connie , I shall stay for a cup of tea , and then , if your father has n't come , we 'll go home . ( To Chalmers . ) Where is Tommy ?</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Chalmers }</speaker>
     <p>Out in the car with Madge .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Glances at tea-table and consults watch . ) She should be back now .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Connie }</speaker>
     <p>Mother , you must n't stay long . I have to dress .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Chalmers }</speaker>
     <p>Oh , yes , that dinner .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Yawns . ) I wish I could loaf to-night .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Connie }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Explaining to Hubbard .</stage>The Turkish Charge d'Affaires — I never can remember his name . But he 's great fun — a positive joy . He 's giving the dinner to the British Ambassador . { Mrs. Starkweather }<stage>Starting forward in her chair and listening intently .</stage>There 's Tommy , now .<stage>Voices of Margaret Chalmers and of Tommy heard from without . Hers is laughingly protesting , while Tommy 's is gleefully insistent .</stage><stage>Margaret and Tommy appear and pause just outside door , holding each other 's hands , facing each other , too immersed in each other to be aware of the presence of those inside the room . Margaret and Tommy are in street costume .</stage>{ Tommy }<stage>Laughing .</stage></p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>But mama</speaker>

     <p><stage>Severely .</stage>I have been wanting to speak to you for some time , Margaret , about that man .

I understand that you have even had him here in your house —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Interrupting .</stage>He is very liable to be here this afternoon , any time , now .</p>

     <speaker>{ Starkweather }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Continuing imperturbably .</stage>Your house — you , my daughter , and the wife of Senator Chalmers . As I said , I have not interfered with you since your marriage . But this Knox affair transcends household arrangements . It is of political importance . The man is an enemy to our class , a firebrand . Why do you have him here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>Because I like him . Because he is a man I am proud to call “ friend . ” Because I wish there were more men like him , many more men like him , in the world . Because I have ever seen in him nothing but the best and highest . And , besides , it 's such good fun to see how one virtuous man can so disconcert you captains of industry and arbiters of destiny . Confess that you are very much disconcerted , father , right now . He will be here in a few minutes , and you will be more disconcerted . Why ? Because it is an affair that transcends family arrangements . And it is your affair , not mine .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Starkweather }</speaker>
     <p>This man Knox is a dangerous character — one that I am not pleased to see any of my family take up with . He is not a gentleman .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>He is a self-made man , if that is what you mean , and he certainly has n't any money .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Connie }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Interrupting .</stage>He says that money is theft — at least when it is in the hands of a wealthy person .</p>

     <p>Surely you would not call his advocacy of that child labor bill and of the conservation of the forest and coal lands stirring up the wild-beast passions of the people ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Starkweather }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Wearily .</stage>You do n't understand . When I say he is dangerous it is because he threatens all the stabilities , because he threatens us who have made this country and upon whom this country and its prosperity rest .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Starkweather }</speaker>
     <p>Call it so . Call it what you will . Without us the country falls into the hands of scoundrels like that man Knox and smashes to ruin .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Reprovingly .</stage>Not a scoundrel , father .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Starkweather }</speaker>
     <p>He is a sentimental dreamer , a hair-brained enthusiast . It is the foolish utterances of men like him that place the bomb and the knife in the hand of the assassin .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>He is at least a good man , even if he does disagree with you on political and industrial problems . And heaven knows that good men are rare enough these days .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Starkweather }</speaker>
     <p>I impugn neither his morality nor his motives — only his rationality . Really , Margaret , there is nothing inherently vicious about him . I grant that . And it is precisely that which makes him such a power for evil .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>When I think of all the misery and pain which he is trying to remedy — I can see in him only a power for good . He is not working for himself but for the many . That is why he has no money . You have heaven alone knows how many millions — you do n't ; you have worked for yourself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Starkweather }</speaker>
     <p>I , too , work for the many . I give work to the many . I make life possible for the many . I am only too keenly alive to the responsibilities of my stewardship of wealth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>But what of the child laborers working at the machines ? Is that necessary , O steward of wealth ? How my heart has ached for them ! How I have longed to do something for them — to change conditions so that it will no longer be necessary for the children to toil , to have the playtime of childhood stolen away from them . Theft — that is what it is , the playtime of the children coined into profits . That is why I like Howard Knox . He calls theft theft . He is trying to do something for those children . What are you trying to do for them ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Starkweather }</speaker>
     <p>Sentiment . Sentiment . The question is too vast and complicated , and you cannot understand . No woman can understand . That is why you run to sentiment . That is what is the matter with this Knox — sentiment . You can n't run a government of ninety millions of people on sentiment , nor on abstract ideas of justice and right .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>But if you eliminate justice and right , what remains ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Starkweather }</speaker>
     <p>This is a practical world , and it must be managed by practical men — by thinkers , not by near-thinkers whose heads are addled with the half-digested ideas of the French Encyclopedists and Revolutionists of a century and a half ago .<stage>Margaret shows signs of impatience — she is not particularly perturbed by this passage-at-arms with her father , and is anxious to get off her street things .</stage>Do n't forget , my daughter , that your father knows the books as well as any cow college graduate from Oregon . I , too , in my student days , dabbled in theories of universal happiness and righteousness , saw my vision and dreamed my dream . I did not know then the weakness , and frailty , and grossness of the human clay . But I grew out of that and into a man . Some men never grow out of that stage . That is what is the trouble with Knox . He is still a dreamer , and a dangerous one .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He pauses a moment , and then his thin lips shut grimly . But he has just about shot his bolt .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>What do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Starkweather }</speaker>
     <p>He has let himself in to give a speech to-morrow , wherein he will be called upon to deliver the proofs of all the lurid charges he has made against the Administration — against us , the stewards of wealth if you please . He will be unable to deliver the proofs , and the nation will laugh . And that will be the political end of Mr. Ali Baba and his dream .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>It is a beautiful dream . Were there more like him the dream would come true . After all , it is the dreamers that build and that never die . Perhaps you will find that he is not so easily to be destroyed . But I can n't stay and argue with you , father . I simply must go and get my things off .</p>

    <stage>Note :— Throughout the rest of this act , Starkweather is like a being apart , a king sitting on his throne . He divides the tea function with Margaret . Men come up to him and speak with him . He sends for men . They come and go at his bidding . The whole attitude , perhaps unconsciously on his part , is that wherever he may be he is master . This attitude is accepted by all the others ; forsooth , he is indeed a great man and master . The only one who is not really afraid of him is Margaret ; yet she gives in to him in so far as she lets him do as he pleases at her afternoon tea . ) ( Dowsett carries the cup of tea and small plate across stage to Starkweather .

    <stage>Painfully endeavoring to be at ease . ) A pleasure , Mr. Starkweather , an entirely unexpected pleasure to meet you here . I was not aware you frequented frivolous gatherings of this nature .</stage>

     <p>That is no excuse , sir . When you are sent for you are to come . Understand ? That bill was reported back . Why was it reported back ? You told Dobleman you would attend to it .</p>

     <p><stage>Angrily .</stage>I refuse to be treated in this manner , Mr. Starkweather . I have some self-respect —</p>

    <stage>Starkweather grunts incredulously . ) Some decency —</stage>

    <stage>Dowsett straightens up to attention with alacrity . ) ( Connie , who has witnessed , rings for Servant . ) I bought that state organization , and paid for it .

     <p>I never dreamed for a moment that I was — er — indiscreet .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Starkweather }</speaker>
     <p>Never forget that every indiscretion of a man in your position is indiscreet . We have a duty , a great and solemn duty to perform . Upon our shoulders rest the destinies of ninety million people . If we fail in our duty , they go down to destruction . Ignorant demagogues are working on the beast-passions of the people . If they have their way , they are lost , the country is lost , civilization is lost . We want no more Dark Ages .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Starkweather }</speaker>
     <p>I have but to raise my hand , any time — do you understand ?— any time , and you are lost . You control your state . Very well . But never forget that to-morrow , if I wished , I could buy your whole machine out from under you . I know you cannot change yourself , but , for the sake of the big issues at stake , you must be careful , exceedingly careful . We are compelled to work with weak tools . You are a good liver , a flesh-pot man . You drink too much . Your heart is weak .— Oh , I have the report of your doctor . Nevertheless , do n't make a fool of yourself , nor of us . Besides , do not forget that your wife is my daughter . She is a strong woman , a credit to both of us . Be careful that you are not a discredit to her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Chalmers }</speaker>
     <p>All right , I 'll be careful . But while we are — er — on this subject , there 's something I 'd like to speak to you about .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>A pause , in which Starkweather waits non-committally . ) It 's this man Knox , and Madge . He comes to the house . They are as thick as thieves .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Starkweather }</speaker>
     <p>Yes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Chalmers }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hastily .</stage>Oh , not a breath of suspicion or anything of that sort , I assure you . But it does n't strike me as exactly appropriate that your daughter and my wife should be friendly with this fire-eating anarchist who is always attacking us and all that we represent .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Starkweather }</speaker>
     <p>I started to speak with her on that subject , but was interrupted .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Puckers brow and thinks . ) You are her husband . Why do n't you take her in hand yourself ?</stage>
    <stage>Enters Mrs. Starkweather from rear , looking about , bowing , then locating Starkweather and proceeding toward him .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Chalmers }</speaker>
     <p>What can I do ? She has a will of her own — the same sort of a will that you have . Besides , I think she knows about my — about some of my — indiscretions .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Starkweather }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Slyly .</stage>Harmless indiscretions ?<stage>Chalmers is about to reply , but observes Mrs. Starkweather approaching .</stage>{ Mrs. Starkweather }</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Speaks in a peevish , complaining voice , and during her harrangue Starkweather immerses himself in notebook . ) Oh , there you are , Anthony . Talking politics , I suppose . Well , as soon as I get a cup of tea we must go . Tommy is not looking as well as I could wish . Margaret loves him , but she does not take the right care of him . I do n't know what the world is coming to when mothers do not know how to rear their offspring . There is Margaret , with her slum kindergartens , taking care of everybody else 's children but her own . If she only performed her church duties as eagerly ! Mr. Rutland is displeased with her . I shall give her a talking to — only , you 'd better do it , Anthony . Somehow , I have never counted much with Margaret . She is as set in doing what she pleases as you are . In my time children paid respect to their parents . This is what comes of speed . There is no time for anything . And now I must get my tea and run . Connie has to dress for that dinner .</stage>
    <stage>Mrs. Starkweather crosses to table , greets others characteristically and is served with tea by Connie .</stage>
    <stage>Chalmers waits respectfully on Starkweather .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Starkweather }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking up from note-book .</stage>That will do , Tom .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Chalmers is just starting across to join others , when voices are heard outside rear entrance , and Margaret enters with Dolores Ortega , wife of the Peruvian Minister , and Matsu Sakari , Secretary of Japanese Legation — both of whom she has met as they were entering the house .</stage>
    <stage>Chalmers changes his course , and meets the above advancing group . He knows Dolores Ortega , whom he greets , and is introduced to Sakari .</stage>
    <stage>Margaret passes on among guests , greeting them , etc . Then she displaces Connie at tea-table and proceeds to dispense tea to the newcomers .</stage>
    <stage>Groups slowly form and seat themselves about stage as follows : Chalmers and Dolores Ortega ; Rutland , Dowsett , Mrs. Starkweather ; Connie , Mr. Dowsett , and Hubbard .</stage>
    <stage>Chalmers carries tea to Dolores Ortega .</stage>
    <stage>Sakari has been lingering by table , waiting for tea and pattering with Margaret , Chalmers , etc .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Handing cup to Sakari .</stage>I am very timid in offering you this , for I am sure you must be appalled by our barbarous methods of making tea .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Sakari }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Bowing .</stage>It is true , your American tea , and the tea of the English , are quite radically different from the tea in my country . But one learns , you know . I served my apprenticeship to American tea long years ago , when I was at Yale . It was perplexing , I assure you — at first , only at first I really believe that I am beginning to have a — how shall I call it ?— a tolerance for tea in your fashion .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>You are very kind in overlooking our shortcomings .</p>

    <stage>Knox comes forward to Margaret , betraying a certain awkwardness due to lack of experience in such social functions . He greets Margaret and those in the group nearest her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p><stage>To Margaret .</stage>I do n't know why I come here . I do not belong . All the ways are strange .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Lightly , at the same time preparing his tea .</stage>The same Ali Baba — once again in the den of the forty thieves . But your watch and pocket-book are safe here , really they are .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Knox makes a gesture of dissent at her facetiousness . ) Now do n't be serious . You should relax sometimes . You live too tensely .</stage>
    <stage>Looking at Starkweather . ) There 's the arch-anarch over there , the dragon you are trying to slay .</stage>
    <stage>Knox looks at Starkweather and is plainly perplexed . ) The man who handles all the life insurance funds , who controls more strings of banks and trust companies than all the Rothschilds a hundred times over — the merger of iron and steel and coal and shipping and all the other things — the man who blocks your child labor bill and all the rest of the remedial legislation you advocate . In short , my father .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking intently at Starkweather .</stage>I should have recognized him from his photographs . But why do you say such things ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>Because they are true .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He remains silent . ) Now , are n't they ? ( She laughs . ) Oh , you do n't need to answer . You know the truth , the whole bitter truth . This is a den of thieves . There is Mr. Hubbard over there , for instance , the trusty journalist lieutenant of the corporations .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p><stage>With an expression of disgust .</stage>I know him . It was he that wrote the Standard Oil side of the story , after having abused Standard Oil for years in the pseudo-muck-raking magazines . He made them come up to his price , that was all . He 's the star writer on Cartwright 's , now , since that magazine changed its policy and became subsidizedly reactionary . I know him — a thoroughly dishonest man . Truly am I Ali Baba , and truly I wonder why I am here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>You are here , sir , because I like you to come .</p>

     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gravely , looking at her with shining eyes .</stage>I sometimes fear for more immediate reasons than that .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Margaret looks at him in alarm , and at the same time betrays pleasure in what he has said . ) For you .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hastily .</stage>Do n't look at me that way . Your eyes are flashing . Some one might see and misunderstand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p><stage>In confusion , awkwardly .</stage>I was unaware that I — that I was looking at you —— in any way that ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>I 'll tell you why you are here . Because I sent for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p><stage>With signs of ardor .</stage>I would come whenever you sent for me , and go wherever you might send me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Reprovingly .</stage>Please , please —— It was about that speech . I have been hearing about it from everybody — rumblings and mutterings and dire prophecies . I know how busy you are , and I ought not to have asked you to come . But there was no other way , and I was so anxious .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pleased .</stage>It seems so strange that you , being what you are , affiliated as you are , should be interested in the welfare of the common people .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Judicially .</stage>I do seem like a traitor in my own camp . But as father said a while ago , I , too , have dreamed my dream . I did it as a girl — Plato 's Republic , Moore 's Utopia — I was steeped in all the dreams of the social dreamers .<stage>During all that follows of her speech , Knox is keenly interested , his eyes glisten and he hangs on her words .</stage>And I dreamed that I , too , might do something to bring on the era of universal justice and fair play . In my heart I dedicated myself to the cause of humanity . I made Lincoln my hero-he still is . But I was only a girl , and where was I to find this cause ?— how to work for it ? I was shut in by a thousand restrictions , hedged in by a thousand conventions . Everybody laughed at me when I expressed the thoughts that burned in me . What could I do ? I was only a woman . I had neither vote nor right of utterance . I must remain silent . I must do nothing . Men , in their lordly wisdom , did all . They voted , orated , governed . The place for women was in the home , taking care of some lordly man who did all these lordly things .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>You understand , then , why I am for equal suffrage .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>But I learned — or thought I learned . Power , I discovered early . My father had power . He was a magnate — I believe that is the correct phrase . Power was what I needed . But how ? I was a woman . Again I dreamed my dream — a modified dream . Only by marriage could I win to power . And there you have the clew to me and what I am and have become . I met the man who was to become my husband . He was clean and strong and an athlete , an outdoor man , a wealthy man and a rising politician . Father told me that if I married him he would make him the power of his state , make him governor , send him to the United States Senate . And there you have it all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>Yes ?—— Yes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>I married . I found that there were greater forces at work than I had ever dreamed of . They took my husband away from me and molded him into the political lieutenant of my father . And I was without power . I could do nothing for the cause . I was beaten . Then it was that I got a new vision . The future belonged to the children . There I could play my woman 's part . I was a mother . Very well . I could do no better than to bring into the world a healthy son and bring him up to manhood healthy and wholesome , clean , noble , and alive . Did I do my part well , through him the results would be achieved . Through him would the work of the world be done in making the world healthier and happier for all the human creatures in it . I played the mother 's part . That is why I left the pitiful little charities of the church and devoted myself to settlement work and tenement house reform , established my kindergartens , and worked for the little men and women who come so blindly and to whom the future belongs to make or mar .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>You are magnificent . I know , now , why I come when you bid me come .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>And then you came . You were magnificent . You were my knight of the windmills , tilting against all power and privilege , striving to wrest the future from the future and realize it here in the present , now . I was sure you would be destroyed . Yet you are still here and fighting valiantly . And that speech of yours to-morrow —</p>

    </sp>
    <stage>They shake hands . ) A cup of tea , Madge . For Mrs. Ortega . Two lumps , please .</stage>

    </sp>
    <stage>Knox shakes his head with a quiet smile .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Tom , be truthful . You do n't hope anything of the sort . You know you are hoping to destroy him .</p>

     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hurriedly .</stage>You see . That is why I was anxious — why I sent for you . Even Tom admits that they who are not won over are destroyed . This speech is a crucial event . You know how rigidly they rule the House and gag men like you . It is they , and they alone , who have given you opportunity for this speech ? Why ?— Why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling confidently .</stage>I know their little scheme . They have heard my charges . They think I am going to make a firebrand speech , and they are ready to catch me without the proofs . They are ready in every way for me . They are going to laugh me down .

     <p><stage>Clearing his throat and expressing himself with ponderous unction .</stage>You will find the solution in the drink traffic . It is liquor , alcohol , that is undermining our industry , our institutions , our faith in God — everything . Yearly the working people drink greater quantities of alcohol . Naturally , through resulting inefficiency , the cost of production is higher , and therefore prices are higher .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Dowsett }</speaker>
     <p>Partly so , partly so . And in line with it , and in addition to it , prices are high because the working class is no longer thrifty . If our working class saved as the French peasant does , we would sell more in the world market and have better times . { Sakari }<stage>Bowing .</stage>As I understand it then , the more thrifty you are the more you save , and the more you save the more you have to sell , the more you sell , the better the times ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>Exactly so . Exactly .</p>

     <p><stage>Abruptly and imperatively .</stage>What causes the high prices ?</p>

     <p><stage>Equally abrupt and just as positive as the other was imperative .</stage>Theft !<stage>It is a sort of a bombshell he has exploded , but they receive it politely and smilingly , even though it has shaken them up .</stage>{ Dolores Ortega } What a romantic explanation . I suppose everybody who has anything has stolen it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>Not quite , but almost quite . Take motorcars , for example . This year five hundred million dollars has been spent for motor-cars . It required men toiling in the mines and foundries , women sewing their eyes out in sweat-shops , shop girls slaving for four and five dollars a week , little children working in the factories and cotton-mills — all these it required to produce those five hundred millions spent this year in motor-cars . And all this has been stolen from those who did the work . { Mrs. Starkweather } I always knew those motor-cars were to blame for terrible things . { Dolores Ortega } But Mr. Knox , I have a motor-car .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Somebody 's labor made that car . Was it yours ?</l>
      <l>{ Dolores Ortega }</l>
      <l>Mercy , no ! I bought it —— and paid for it .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>Then did you labor at producing something else , and exchange the fruits of that labor for the motor-car ?<stage>A pause .</stage>You do not answer . Then I am to understand that you have a motor-car which was made by somebody else 's labor and for which you gave no labor of your own . This I call theft . You call it property . Yet it is theft .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Starkweather }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Interrupting Dolores Ortega who was just about to speak .</stage>But surely you have intelligence to see the question in larger ways than stolen motor-cars . I am a man of affairs . I do n't steal motor-cars .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>Not concrete little motor-cars , no . You do things on a large scale .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Starkweather }</speaker>
     <p>I am like a certain gentleman from Missouri . You 've got to show me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>And I 'm like the man from Texas . It 's got to be put in my hand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Starkweather }</speaker>
     <p>I shift my residence at once to Texas . Put it in my hand that I steal on a large scale .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>Very well . You are the great financier , merger , and magnate . Do you mind a few statistics ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Starkweather }</speaker>
     <p>Go ahead .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>You exercise a controlling interest in nine billion dollars ’ worth of railways ; in two billion dollars ’ worth of industrial concerns ; in one billion dollars ’ worth of life insurance groups ; in one billion dollars ’ worth of banking groups ; in two billion dollars ’ worth of trust companies . Mind you , I do not say you own all this , but that you exercise a controlling interest . That is all that is necessary . In short , you exercise a controlling interest in such a proportion of the total investments of the United States , as to set the pace for all the rest . Now to my point . In the last few years seventy billions of dollars have been artificially added to the capitalization of the nation 's industries . By that I mean water — pure , unadulterated water . You , the merger , know what water means . I say seventy billions . It does n't matter if we call it forty billions or eighty billions ; the amount , whatever it is , is a huge one . And what does seventy billions of water mean ? It means , at five per cent , that three billions and a half must be paid for things this year , and every year , more than things are really worth . The people who labor have to pay this . There is theft for you . There is high prices for you . Who put in the water ? Who gets the theft of the water ? Have I put it in your hand ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>Your salary comes out of that water I mentioned . Do you want to know who pays your salary ? Not your parishioners . But the little children toiling in the mills , and all the rest — all the slaves on the wheel of labor pay you your salary . { Rutland } I earn it .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Sakari }</speaker>
     <p>How would you remedy this — er — this theft ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Starkweather again closes note-book on finger and listens as Knox begins to speak .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>Very simply . By changing the governmental machinery by which this household of ninety millions of people conducts its affairs .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Sakari }</speaker>
     <p>I thought — I was taught so at Yale — that your governmental machinery was excellent , most excellent .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>It is antiquated . It is ready for the scrap-heap . Instead of being our servant , it has mastered us . We are its slaves . All the political brood of grafters and hypocrites have run away with it , and with us as well . In short , from the municipalities up , we are dominated by the grafters . It is a reign of theft .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Hubbard }</speaker>
     <p>But any government is representative of its people . No people is worthy of a better government than it possesses . Were it worthier , it would possess a better government .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Starkweather nods his head approvingly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>That is a lie . And I say to you now that the average morality and desire for right conduct of the people of the United States is far higher than that of the government which misrepresents it . The people are essentially worthy of a better government than that which is at present in the hands of the politicians , for the benefit of the politicians and of the interests the politicians represent . I wonder , Mr. Sakari , if you have ever heard the story of the four aces .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Sakari }</speaker>
     <p>I cannot say that I have .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>Do you understand the game of poker ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Sakari }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Considering .</stage>Yes , a marvelous game . I have learned it — at Yale . It was very expensive .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>Well , that story reminds me of our grafting politicians . They have no moral compunctions . They look upon theft as right — eminently right . They see nothing wrong in the arrangement that the man who deals the cards should give himself the best in the deck . Never mind what he deals himself , they 'll have the deal next and make up for it . { Dolores Ortega } But the story , Mr. Knox . I , too , understand poker .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>It occurred out in Nevada , in a mining camp . A tenderfoot was watching a game of poker , He stood behind the dealer , and he saw the dealer deal himself four aces from the bottom of the deck .<stage>From now on , he tells the story in the slow , slightly drawling Western fashion .</stage>The tenderfoot went around to the player on the opposite side of the table . “ Say , ” he says , “ I just seen the dealer give himself four aces off the bottom . ” The player looked at him a moment , and said , “ What of it ? ” “ Oh , nothing , ” said the tenderfoot , “ only I thought you might want to know . I tell you I seen the dealer give himself four aces off the bottom . ” “ Look here , Mister , ” said the player , “ you 'd better get out of this . You do n't understand the game . It 's HIS deal , ai n't it ? ”</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Dobleman }</speaker>
     <p>But they are not . The stenographer , Miss Standish , has confessed . For a long time she has followed the practice of taking two or three letters and documents at a time away from the office . Many have been photographed and returned . But the more important ones were retained and clever copies returned . Martinaw says that Miss Standish herself does not know and cannot tell which of the ones she returned are genuine and which are copies .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Hubbard }</speaker>
     <p>Knox never did this .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Starkweather }</speaker>
     <p>Trust Gherst for more ability than that . He will certainly exploit them in his newspapers , but not until after Knox has used them in his speech . Oh , the cunning dog ! Never could he have chosen a better mode and moment to strike at me , at the Administration , at everything . That is Gherst all over . Playing to the gallery . Inducing Knox to make this spectacular exposure on the floor of the House just at the critical time when so many important bills are pending .<stage>To Dobleman .</stage>Did Martinaw give you any idea of the nature of the stolen documents ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>I do n't know the import of all these letters , but I can guess , and it does seem serious .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Starkweather }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Furiously .</stage>Serious ! Let me tell you that there has been no exposure like this in the history of the country . It means hundreds of millions of dollars . It means more — the loss of power . And still more , it means the mob , the great mass of the child-minded people rising up and destroying all that I have labored to do for them . Oh , the fools ! The fools !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Chalmers }</speaker>
     <p>It is unfortunate . The people are restless and excited as it is . They are being constantly prodded on by the mouthings of the radical press , of the muck-raking magazines and of the demagogues . The people are like powder awaiting the spark .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Starkweather }</speaker>
     <p>This man Knox is no fool , if he is a dreamer . He is a shrewd knave . He is a fighter . He comes from the West — the old pioneer stock . His father drove an ox-team across the Plains to Oregon . He knows how to play his cards , and never could circumstances have placed more advantageous cards in his hands .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Chalmers }</speaker>
     <p>And nothing like this has ever touched you before .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Starkweather }</speaker>
     <p>I have always stood above the muck and ruck — clear and clean and unassailable . But this — this is too much ! It is the spark . There is no forecasting what it may develop into .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Chalmers }</speaker>
     <p>A political turnover .</p>

     <speaker>{ Starkweather }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Nodding savagely .</stage>A new party , a party of demagogues , in power . Government ownership of the railways and telegraphs . A graduated income tax that will mean no less than the confiscation of private capital .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Chalmers }</speaker>
     <p>And all that mass of radical legislation — the Child Labor Bill , the new Employers ’ Liability Act , the government control of the Alaskan coal fields , that interference with Mexico . And that big power corporation you have worked so hard to form .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Starkweather }</speaker>
     <p>It must not be . It is an unthinkable calamity . It means that the very process of capitalistic development is hindered , stopped . It means a setback of ten years in the process . It means work , endless work , to overcome the setback . It means not alone the passage of all this radical legislation with the consequent disadvantages , but it means the fingers of the mob clutching at our grip of control . It means anarchy . It means ruin and misery for all the blind fools and led-cattle of the mass who will strike at the very sources of their own existence and comfort .</p>

    <stage>Tommy enters from left , evidently playing a game , in the course of which he is running away . By his actions he shows that he is pursued .

     <p>There is an alternative . You are interested in social problems . You are a student of sociology . Those whom I represent are genuinely interested in you .

    <stage>Knox starts toward door to open it . ) ( Hubbabd , looking about him in alarm , flees across stage and into bedroom , closing the door . During all the following scene , Hubbard , from time to time , opens door , and peers out at what is going on .</stage>

     <p><stage>Shaking hands with Knox .</stage>Forgive me , but I had to see you . I could not get you on the telephone . I called and called , and the best I could do was to get the wrong number .</p>

     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Recovering from his astonishment .</stage>Yes . I am glad .</p>

    <stage>Seeing Tommy . ) Hello , Tommy .</stage>
    <stage>Knox holds out his hand , and Tommy shakes it gravely . Linda stays in back-ground . Her face is troubled .</stage>

     <p>How do you do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>There was no other way , and it was so necessary for me to warn you . I brought Tommy and Linda along to chaperon me .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>But you are . You labor more mightily than you admit — or dare to think . Oh , I know you — better than you do yourself .</p>

     <p>Do you read all those books ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I am still going to school and studying hard . What are you going to study to be when you grow up ?<stage>Tommy meditates but does not answer .</stage>President of these great United States ?</p>

     <p>Not a Lincoln ?</p>

    <stage>Tommy is in doubt .</stage>
    <sp>

     <p>But do n't you remember what a great good man Lincoln was ? You remember I told you ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>What ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Tommy }</speaker>
     <p>I want to be a senator like father . He makes them dance .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Margaret is shocked , and Knox 's eyes twinkle .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>Makes whom dance ? { Tommy }<stage>Puzzled .</stage>I do n't know .</p>

     <p><stage>Starting to cross stage to left .</stage>Come , Tommy . Let us look out of the window .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Tommy }</speaker>
     <p>I 'd rather talk with Mr. Knox .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>Please do , Tommy . Mamma wants to talk to Mr. Knox .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Tommy yields , and crosses to right , where he joins Linda in looking out of the window .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>You might ask me to take a seat</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>Oh ! I beg pardon .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He draws up a comfortable chair for her , and seats himself in desk-chair , facing her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>I have only a few minutes . Tom is at father 's , and I am to pick him up there and go on to that dinner , after I 've taken Tommy home .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>But your maid ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>Linda ? Wild horses could not drag from her anything that she thought would harm me . So intense is her fidelity that it almost shames me . I do not deserve it . But this is not what I came to you about .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She speaks the following hurriedly . ) After you left this afternoon , something happened . Father received a telegram . It seemed most important . His secretary followed upon the heels of the telegram . Father called Tom and Mr. Hubbard to him and they held a conference . I think they have discovered the loss of the documents , and that they believe you have them . I did not hear them mention your name , yet I am absolutely certain that they were talking about you . Also , I could tell from father 's face that something was terribly wrong . Oh , be careful ! Do be careful !</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>There is no danger , I assure you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>But you do not know them . I tell you you do not know them . They will stop at nothing — at nothing . Father believes he is right in all that he does .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>I know . That is what makes him so formidable . He has an ethical sanction .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Nodding .</stage>It is his religion .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>And , like any religion with a narrow-minded man , it runs to mania .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>He believes that civilization rests on him , and that it is his sacred duty to preserve civilization .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>I know . I know .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>But you ? But you ? You are in danger .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>No ; I shall remain in to-night . To-morrow , in the broad light of midday , I shall proceed to the House and give my speech .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Wildly .</stage>Oh , if anything should happen to you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking at her searchingly .</stage>You do care ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Margaret nods , with eyes suddenly downcast . ) For Howard Knox , the reformer ? Or for me , the man ?</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Impulsively .</stage>Oh , why must a woman forever remain quiet ? Why should I not tell you what you already know ?— what you must already know ? I do care for you — for man and reformer , both — for —<stage>She is aflame , but abruptly ceases and glances across at Tommy by the window , warned instinctively that she must not give way to love in her child 's presence .</stage>Linda ! Will you take Tommy down to the machine —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Alarmed , interrupting , in low voice .</stage>What are you doing ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hushing Knox with a gesture .</stage>I 'll follow you right down .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Linda and Tommy proceed across stage toward right exit .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Tommy }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pausing before Knox and gravely extending his hand .</stage>Good evening , Mr. Knox .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Awkwardly .</stage>Good evening , Tommy . You take my word for it , and look up this Lincoln question .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Tommy }</speaker>
     <p>I shall . I 'll ask father about it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Significantly .</stage>You attend to that , Linda . Nobody must know — this .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Linda nods .</stage>
    <stage>Linda and Tommy make exit to right .</stage>
    <stage>Margaret , seated , slips back her cloak , revealing herself in evening gown , and looks at Knox sumptuously , lovingly , and willingly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Inflamed by the sight of her .</stage>Do n't ! Do n't ! I can n't stand it . Such sight of you fills me with madness .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Margaret laughs low and triumphantly . ) I do n't want to think of you as a woman . I must not . Allow me .</stage>
    <stage>He rises and attempts to draw cloak about her shoulders , but she resists him . Yet does he succeed in partly cloaking her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>I want you to see me as a woman . I want you to think of me as a woman . I want you mad for me .<stage>She holds out her arms , the cloak slipping from them .</stage>I want — do n't you see what I want ?——</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Knox sinks back in chair , attempting to shield his eyes with his hand .</stage>
    <stage>Slipping cloak fully back from her again .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Look at me</speaker>
     <p>{ Knox }</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Looking , coming to his feet , and approaching her , with extended arms , murmuring softly . ) Margaret . Margaret .</stage>
    <stage>Margaret rises to meet him , and they are clasped in each other 's arms .</stage>
    <stage>Hubbard , peering forth through door , looks at them with an expression of cynical amusement . His gaze wan-ders , and he sees the documents , within arm 's reach , on top of bookcase . He picks up documents , holds them to the light of stage to glance at them , and , with triumphant expression on face , disappears and closes door .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Holding Margaret from him and looking at her .</stage>I love you . I do love you . But I had resolved never to speak it , never to let you know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>Silly man . I have known long that you loved me . You have told me so often and in so many ways . You could not look at me without telling me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>You saw ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>How could I help seeing ? I was a woman . Only , with your voice you never spoke a word . Sit down , there , where I may look at you , and let me tell you . I shall do the speaking now .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She urges him back into the desk-chair , and reseats herself . ) ( She makes as if to pull the cloak around ‘ her . ) Shall I ?</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Vehemently .</stage>No , no ! As you are . Let me feast my eyes upon you who are mine . I must be dreaming .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a low , satisfied laugh of triumph .</stage>Oh , you men ! As of old , and as forever , you must be wooed through your senses . Did I display the wisdom of an Hypatia , the science of a Madam Curie , yet would you keep your iron control , throttling the voice of your heart with silence . But let me for a moment be Lilith , for a moment lay aside this garment constructed for the purpose of keeping out the chill of night , and on the instant you are fire and aflame , all voluble with love 's desire .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Protestingly .</stage>Margaret ! It is not fair !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>I love you — and — you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Fervently and reverently .</stage>I love you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>Then listen . I have told you of my girlhood and my dreams . I wanted to do what you are so nobly doing . And I did nothing . I could do nothing . I was not permitted . Always was I compelled to hold myself in check . It was to do what you are doing , that I married . And that , too , failed me . My husband became a henchman of the Interests , my own father 's tool for the perpetuation of the evils against which I desired to fight .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She pauses . ) It has been a long fight , and I have been very tired , for always did I confront failure . My husband — I did not love him . I never loved him . I sold myself for the Cause , and the cause profited nothing . ( Pause . ) Often , I have lost faith — faith in everything , in God and man , in the hope of any righteousness ever prevailing . But again and again , by what you are doing , have you awakened me . I came to-night with no thought of self . I came to warn you , to help the good work on . I remained — thank God !— I remained to love you — and to be loved by you . I suddenly found myself , looking at you , very weary . I wanted you — you , more than anything in the world .</stage>
    <stage>She holds out her arms . ) Come to me . I want you — now .</stage>
    <stage>Knox , in an ecstacy , comes to her . He seats himself on the broad arm of the chair and is drawn into her arms .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>But I have been tired at times . I was very tired to-night — and you came . And now I am glad , only glad .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>I have been wanton to-night . I confess it . I am proud of it . But it was not — professional . It was the first time in my life . Almost do I regret — almost do I regret that I did not do it sooner — it has been crowned with such success . You have held me in your arms — your arms . Oh , you will never know what that first embrace meant to me . I am not a clod . I am not iron nor stone . I am a woman — a warm , breathing woman —.<stage>She rises , and draws him to his feet .</stage>Kiss me , my dear lord and lover . Kiss me .<stage>They embrace .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Passionately , looking about him wildly as if in search of something .</stage>What shall we do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Suddenly releasing her and sinking back in his own chair almost in collapse . ) No . It cannot be . It is impossible . Oh , why could we not have met long ago ? We would have worked together . What a comradeship it would have been .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>But it is not too late .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>I have no right to you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Misunderstanding .</stage>My husband ? He has not been my husband for years . He has no rights . Who , but you whom I love , has any rights ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>No ; it is not that .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Snapping his fingers . ) That for him .</stage>
    <stage>Breaking down . ) Oh , if I were only the man , and not the reformer ! If I had no work to do !</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coming to the back of his chair and caressing his hair .</stage>We can work together .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Shaking his head under her fingers .</stage>Do n't ! Do n't !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She persists , and lays her cheek against his . ) You make it so hard . You tempt me so .</stage>
    <stage>He rises suddenly , takes her two hands in his , leads her gently to her chair , seats her , and reseats himself in desk-chair . ) Listen . It is not your husband . But I have no right to you . Nor have you a right to me .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Interrupting , jealously .</stage>And who but I has any right to you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling sadly .</stage>No ; it is not that . There is no other woman . You are the one woman for me . But there are many others who have greater rights in me than you . I have been chosen by two hundred thousand citizens to represent them in the Congress of the United States . And there are many more —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He breaks off suddenly and looks at her , at her arms and shoulders . ) Yes , please . Cover them up . Help me not to forget .</stage>
    <stage>Margaret does not obey . ) There are many more who have rights in me — the people , all the people , whose cause I have made mine . The children — there are two million child laborers in these United States . I cannot betray them . I cannot steal my happiness from them . This afternoon I talked of theft . But would not this , too , be theft ?</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sharply .</stage>Howard ! Wake up ! Has our happiness turned your head ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sadly .</stage>Almost — and for a few wild moments , quite . There are all the children . Did I ever tell you of the tenement child , who when asked how he knew when spring came , answered : When he saw the saloons put up their swing doors .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Irritated .</stage>But what has all that to do with one man and one woman loving ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>Suppose we loved — you and I ; suppose we loosed all the reins of our love . What would happen ? You remember Gorki , the Russian patriot , when he came to New York , aflame with passion for the Russian revolution . His purpose in visiting the land of liberty was to raise funds for that revolution . And because his marriage to the woman he loved was not of the essentially legal sort worshiped by the shopkeepers , and because the newspapers made a sensation of it , his whole mission was brought to failure . He was laughed and derided out of the esteem of the American people . That is what would happen to me . I should be slandered and laughed at . My power would be gone .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>And even if so — what of it ? Be slandered and laughed at . We will have each other . Other men will rise up to lead the people , and leading the people is a thankless task . Life is so short . We must clutch for the morsel of happiness that may be ours .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>Ah , if you knew , as I look into your eyes , how easy it would be to throw everything to the winds . But it would be theft .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rebelliously .</stage>Let it be theft . Life is so short , dear . We are the biggest facts in the world — to each other .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>It is not myself alone , nor all my people . A moment ago you said no one but I had any right to you . You were wrong . Your child —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p><stage>In sudden pain , pleadingly .</stage>Do n't !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>I must . I must save myself — and you . Tommy has rights in you . Theft again . What other name for it if you steal your happiness from him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Bending her head forward on her hand and weeping .</stage>I have been so lonely — and then you — you came , and the world grew bright and warm — a few short minutes ago you held me — in your arms — a few short minutes ago and it seemed my dream of happiness had come true — and now you dash it from me —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Struggling to control himself now that she is no longer looking at him .</stage>No ; I ask you to dash it from yourself . I am not too strong . You must help me . You must call your child to your aid in helping me . I could go mad for you now —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Rising impulsively and coming to her with arms outstretched to clasp her . ) Right now —</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Abruptly raising her head , and with one outstretched arm preventing the embrace .</stage>Wait .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She bows her head on her hand for a moment , to think and to win control of herself .</stage>
    <stage>Lifting her head and looking at him . ) Sit down — please .</stage>
    <stage>Knox reseats himself .</stage>
    <stage>A pause , during which she looks at him and loves him . ) Dear , I do so love you —</stage>
    <stage>Knox loses control and starts to rise . ) No ! Sit there . I was weak . Yet I am not sorry . You are right . We must forego each other . We cannot be thieves , even for love 's sake . Yet I am glad that this has happened — that I have lain in your arms and had your lips on mine . The memory of it will be sweet always .</stage>
    <stage>She draws her cloak around her , and rises .</stage>
    <stage>Knox rises . ) You are right . The future belongs to the children . There lies duty — yours , and mine in my small way . I am going now . We must not see each other ever again . We must work — and forget . But remember , my heart goes with you into the fight . My prayers will accompany every stroke .</stage>
    <stage>She hesitates , pauses , draws her cloak thoroughly around her in evidence of departure . ) Dear — will you kiss me — once — one last time ? ( There is no passion in this kiss , which is the kiss of renunciation . Margaret herself terminates the embrace .</stage>
    <stage>Knox accompanies her silently to the door and places hand on knob . ) I wish I had something of you to have with me always — a photograph , that little one , you remember , which I liked so . ( She nods . ) Do n't run the risk of sending it by messenger . Just mail it ordinarily .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>I shall mail it to-morrow . I 'll drop it in the box myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Kissing her hand .</stage>Good-bye .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p><stage>lingeringly .</stage>But oh , my dear , I am glad and proud for what has happened . I would not erase a single line of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She indicates for Knox to open door , which he does , but which he immediately closes as she continues speaking . ) There must be immortality . There must be a future life where you and I shall meet again . Good-bye .</stage>
    <stage>They press each other 's hands .</stage>

     <stage>Scene . The library , used as a sort of semi-office by Starkweather at such times when he is in Washington . Door to right ; also , door to right rear . At left rear is an alcove , without hangings , which is dark . To left are windows . To left , near windows , a fiat-top desk , with desk-chair and desk-telephone . Also , on desk , conspicuously , is a heavy dispatch box . At the center rear is a large screen . Extending across center back of room are heavy , old-fashioned bookcases , with swinging glass doors . The bookcases narrow about four feet from the floor , thus forming a ledge . Between left end of bookcases and alcove at left rear , high up on wall , hangs a large painting or steel engraving of Abraham Lincoln . In design and furnishings , it is a simple chaste room , coldly rigid and slightly old-fashioned .</stage>

Better than that he was pliable , capable of being molded to perform your work , to manipulate machine politics and procure for you the legislation you desired . You did not consider what kind of a husband he would make for your daughter whom you did not know . But you gave your daughter to him — sold her to him — because you needed him —</p>

     <p>Please , Mr. Rutland , do n't be ridiculous . Father is only making a stalking horse out of you . Whatever I may have done , or not done , I believe I am doing right . The whole thing is infamous . The people have been lied to and robbed , and you are merely lending yourself to the infamy of perpetuating the lying and the robbing .

     <p>There is nothing less than the worst to be believed . Besides , more heinous than your relations with this man is what you have done here in this room , stolen from me , and practically before my very eyes .

     <p>You would condone this — this adultery . You , who have just said that I was morally unfit to have my own boy , will permit me to retain him .

    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>Yes ; this very morning . That was the cause of all the trouble . If I had n't stolen them nothing would have happened . Hubbard had just returned them to my father .</p>

     <p>Dear man , I did n't do it for you . I was n't brave enough . I should have given in . I do n't mind confessing that I started to do it for you , but it soon grew so terrible that I was afraid . It grew so terrible that had it been for you alone I should have surrendered . But out of the terror of it all I caught a wider vision , and all that you said last night rose before me . And I knew that you were right . I thought of all the people , and of the little children . I did it for them , after all . You speak for them . I stole the papers so that you could use them in speaking for the people . Do n't you see , dear man ?</p>

     <p>But as you told me yourself , those scraps of paper represent the happiness of millions of lives . It is not our happiness that is matched against some scraps of paper . It is our happiness against millions of lives — like ours . All these millions have hearts , and loves , and desires , just like ours .</p>

     <p>But it is a great social and cosmic process . It does not depend on one man . Kill off , at this instant , every leader of the people , and the process will go on just the same .

     <p>No , it is necessary . What you said last night , when I was weak , was wise . We cannot steal from my child —</p>

    </sp>
    <stage>Shaking her head . ) Nor can we steal from any other woman 's child — from all the children of all the women . And other things I heard you say , and you were right .

All you have to do is to say the word , one little word . Say it .— Say it .</p>

     <p>You and I never hit it off together any too extraordinarily well , Madge ; but I 'm not altogether a bad sort . I am easy-going . I always have been easy-going .

     <speaker>A better lover</speaker>
     <p>{ Margaret }<stage>To Chalmers .</stage>He is weak to-day . What of it ? He was strong last night . He will win back his strength again . It is human to be weak . And in his very weakness now , I have my pride , for it is the weakness of love . God knows I have been weak , and I am not ashamed of it . It was the weakness of love . It is hard to stifle one 's womanhood always with morality .<stage>Quickly .</stage>But do not mistake , Tom . This of mine is no conventional morality . I do not care about nasty gossipy tongues and sensation-mongering sheets ; nor do I care what any persons of all the persons I know , would say if I went away with Mr. Knox this instant . I would go , and go gladly and proudly with him , divorce or no divorce , scandal or scandal triple-fold — if — if no one else were hurt by what I did .<stage>To Knox .</stage>Howard , I tell you that I would go with you now , in all willingness and joy , with May-time and the songs of all singing birds in my heart — were it not for the others . But there is a higher morality . We must not hurt those others . We dare not steal our happiness from them . The future belongs to them , and we must not , dare not , sacrifice that future nor give it in pledge for our own happiness . Last night I came to you . I was weak — yes ; more than that — I was ignorant . I did not know , even as late as last night , the monstrous vileness , the consummate wickedness of present-day conditions . I learned that today , this morning , and now . I learned that the morality of the Church was a pretense . Far deeper than it , and vastly more powerful , was the morality of the dollar . My father , my family , my husband , were willing to condone what they believed was my adultery . And for what ? For a few scraps of paper that to them represented only the privilege to plunder , the privilege to steal from the people .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>To Chalmers . ) Here are you , Tom , not only willing and eager to give me into the arms of the man you believe my lover , but you throw in your boy — your child and mine — to make it good measure and acceptable . And for what ? Love of some woman ?— any woman ? No . Love of humanity ? No . Love of God ? No . Then for what ? For the privilege of perpetuating your stealing from the people — money , bread and butter , hats , shoes , and stockings — for stealing all these things from the people .</stage>
    <stage>To Knox . ) Now , and at last , do I realize how stern and awful is the fight that must be waged — the fight in which you and I , Howard , must play our parts and play them bravely and uncomplainingly — you as well as I , but I even more than you . This is the den of thieves . I am a child of thieves . All my family is composed of thieves . I have been fed and reared on the fruits of thievery . I have been a party to it all my life . Somebody must cease from this theft , and it is I . And you must help me , Howard .</stage>

     <speaker>{ Chalmers }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Emitting a low long whistle .</stage>Strange that you never went into the suffragette business . With such speech-making ability you would have been a shining light .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sadly .</stage>The worst of it is , Margaret , you are right . But it is hard that we cannot be happy save by stealing from the happiness of others . Yet it hurts , deep down and terribly , to forego you .<stage>Margaret thanks him with her eyes .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Chalmers }</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sarcastically .</stage>Oh , believe me , I am not too anxious to give up my wife . Look at her . She 's a pretty good woman for any man to possess .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>Tom , I 'll accept a quiet divorce , marry Mr. Knox , and take Tommy with me — on one consideration .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Chalmers }</speaker>
     <p>And what is that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

    <stage>To Linda . ) Yes ; give them to me .</stage>

    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>And all the forces making for the good time coming will be quickened by your words . Let the voices of the millions be in it .<stage>Chalmers , legs still stretched out , laughs cynically .</stage>You know where my heart lies . Some day , in all pride and honor , stealing from no one , hurting no one , we shall come together — to be together always .</p>

    <stage>During the following speech Linda enters from right with whiskey and soda and gives it to Chalmers , who thirstily drinks half of it . Margaret dismisses Linda with her eyes , and Linda makes exit to right rear .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Knox }</speaker>
     <p>I had n't that in mind , but now that you mention it , it seems to the point . That heart of yours is n't going to carry you much farther . You have played fast and loose with it as with everything else . You are like the carter who steals hay from his horse that he may gamble . You have stolen from your heart . Some day , soon , like the horse , it will quit We can afford to wait . It wo n't be long .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>{ Chalmers }</speaker>
     <p><stage>After laughing incredulously and sipping his whiskey .</stage>Well , Knox , neither of us wins . You do n't get the woman . Neither do I . She remains under my roof , and I fancy that is about all . I wo n't divorce her . What 's the good ? But I 've got her tied hard and fast by Tommy . You wo n't get her .</p>

    <stage>Knox , ignoring hint , goes to right rear and pauses in doorway .</stage>

     <speaker>{ Margaret }</speaker>
     <p>Work . Bravely work . You are my knight . Go .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Knox makes exit .</stage>

     <p>Madge .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Margaret neither moves nor answers . ) I say , Madge .</stage>
    <stage>He stands up and moves toward her , holding whiskey glass in one hand . ) That speech is going to make a devil of a row . But I do n't think it will be so bad as your father says . It looks pretty dark , but such things blow over . They always do blow over . And so with you and me . Maybe we can manage to forget all this and patch it up somehow .</stage>
    <stage>She gives no sign that she is aware of his existence . ) Why do n't you speak ? ( Pause .</stage>
    <stage>He touches her arm . ) Madge .</stage>
