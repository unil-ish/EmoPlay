     <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>: Yes ; I am reeling , wrung ,</l>
      <l>With one glance o'er the precipice of ill !</l>
      <l>Say his incanted prophecies spring from</l>
      <l>No power that 's more than frenzied fantasy !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>: Who prophesies ? Who now upon this isle</l>
      <l>More than visible and present day</l>
      <l>Can gather to his eye ? Tell me .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>: The monk —</l>
      <l>Ah , chide me not !— mad Agabus , who can</l>
      <l>Unsphere dark spirits from their evil airs</l>
      <l>And show all things of love or death , seized me</l>
      <l>As hither I stole to thee . With wild looks</l>
      <l>And wilder lips he vented on my ear</l>
      <l>Boding more wild than both . “ Sappho ! ” he cried ,</l>
      <l>“ Sappho ! Sappho ! ” and probed my eyes as if</l>
      <l>Destiny moved dark-visaged in their deeps .</l>
      <l>Then tore his rags and moaned , “ So young , to cease ! ”</l>
      <l>Gazed then out into awful vacancy ;</l>
      <l>And whispered hotly , following his gaze ,</l>
      <l>“ The Shadow ! Shadow ! ”</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>: This is but a whim ,</l>
      <l>A sudden gloomy surge of superstition .</l>
      <l>Put it from you , my Helena .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>: But he</l>
      <l>Has often cleft the future with his ken ,</l>
      <l>Seen through it to some lurking misery</l>
      <l>And mar of love : or the dim knell of death</l>
      <l>Heard and revealed .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>: A witless monk who thinks</l>
      <l>God lives but to fulfil his prophecies !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>: You know him not . ‘ Tis told in youth he loved</l>
      <l>One treacherous , and in avenge made fierce</l>
      <l>Treaty with Hell that lends him sight of all</l>
      <l>Ills that arise from it to mated hearts !</l>
      <l>Yet look not so , my lord ! I 'll trust thine eyes</l>
      <l>That tell me love is master of all times ,</l>
      <l>And thou of all love master !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>: And of thee ?</l>
      <l>Then will the winds return unto the night</l>
      <l>And flute us lover songs of happiness !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>: Nor dare upon a duller note while here</l>
      <l>We tryst beneath the moon ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>: My perfect Greek !</l>
      <l>Athene looks again out of thy lids ,</l>
      <l>And Venus trembles in thy every limb !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
     <p>Not Venus , ah , not Venus !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
     <p>Now ; again ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>: ‘ Twas on this temple 's ancient gate she found</l>
      <l>Wounded Adonis dead , and to forget ,</l>
      <l>Like Sappho leaped , ‘ tis said , from yonder cliff</l>
      <l>Down to the waves ’ oblivion below .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
     <p>And will you read such terror in a tale ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
     <p>Forgive me , then .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Surely you are unstrung ,</l>
      <l>And yet there is ——</l>

     <p>Is what ? Antonio ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>: Nothing : I who must ebb with you and flow</l>
      <l>A little was moved .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>: Not you , not you ! I 'll change</l>
      <l>My tears to laughter , if but fantasy</l>
      <l>May so unmettle you ! Not moved , indeed !</l>
      <l>Not moved , Antonio ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>: Well , let us off ,</l>
      <l>My Helena , with these numb awes that wind</l>
      <l>About our joy .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HELENA</speaker>

      <l>On Fate 's hard brow would shame it of all frown !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>: Yet is thine mightier , for no frown can be</l>
      <l>When no more gloom 's in the world !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>: But ‘ tis thy lips</l>
      <l>That lend it might . If I pressed other ——</l>

     <lg>
      <l>Other !</l>
      <l>You should not know that any other lips</l>
      <l>Could e'er be pressed ; I 'll have no kiss but his</l>

     <p>Oh ?— Well .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>HELENA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>The vainest glooms</l>
      <l>To-night seem ominous — as cloud-flakes flung</l>
      <l>Upward before the heaving of the west .</l>
      <stage>In fright</stage>

      <l>Of impotence — as one who in a tomb</l>
      <l>Awakes and waits ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>

      <l>Intolerable more than loss of life .</l>
      <l>You both shall learn this night 's entangling .</l>

      <l>No flesh to understand this passion then ?</l>
      <l>Bound to the wings of wide ambition he</l>
      <l>Will choose undowered worth ?— To the ordeal</l>
      <l>Of mere suspicion 's flaming I 'd not trust</l>
      <l>The fairness of his name ; but doubts in me</l>

     <p>Yet the rogue Cecco , the duke 's half-seneschal , half-spy , I passed upon the streets o'ermuch in wine , Leaning upon a tipsier jade and spouting With drunken mockery , “ ‘ Sweet Helena ! Fair Helena ! ’ Pluck me , wench , but the lord Antonio knows sound nuts ! And sly ! Why hear you now ! he gets the duke to seize on the maid ! The fox ! The rat ! Have I not heard him in his chamber these thirty nights puff her name out his window with as many honeyed drawls of passion as — as — as — June has buds ? ‘ Sweet Helena ! ’ — la ! ‘ Fair Helena ! ’ — O ! ‘ Dear Helena ! my rose ! my queen ! my sun and moon and stars ! Thy kiss is still at my lips , thy breast beats still on mine ! my Helena ! ’ — Um ! Oh , ‘ tmust be a rare damsel . I 'll make a sluice between her purse and mine , wench ; do you hear ? ”</p>

      <l>A mother been to her unfolding years</l>
      <l>But to see now unchastest cruelty</l>
      <l>Pluck her white bloom to ease his idle sense</l>
      <l>One fragrant hour ?— If it be so , no flowers</l>
