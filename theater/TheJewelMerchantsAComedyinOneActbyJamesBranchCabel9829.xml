     <p>TO LOUISE BURLEIGH This latest avatar of so many notions which were originally hers . THE AUTHOR 'S PROLOGUE</p>
    </epigraph>
   </titlePage>
   <performance>Prudence urges me here to forestall detection , by conceding that this brief play has no pretension to “ literary ” quality . It is a piece in its inception designed for , and in its making swayed by , the requirements of the little theatre stage . The one virtue which anybody anywhere could claim for The Jewel Merchants is the fact that it “ acts ” easily and rather effectively . And candor compels the admission forthwith that the presence of this anchoritic merit in the wilderness is hardly due to me . When circumstances and the Little Theatre League of Richmond combined to bully me into contriving the dramatization of a short story called Balthazar 's Daughter , I docilely converted this tale into a one-act play of which you will find hereinafter no sentence . The comedy I wrote is now at one with the lost dramaturgy of Pollio and of Posidippus , and is even less likely ever to be resurrected for mortal auditors . It read , I still think , well enough : I am certain that , when we came to rehearse , the thing did not “ act ” at all , and that its dialogue , whatever its other graces , had the defect of being unspeakable . So at each rehearsal we — by which inclusive pronoun I would embrace the actors and the producing staff at large , and with especial ( metaphorical ) ardor Miss Louise Burleigh , who directed all — changed here a little , and there a little more ; and shifted this bit , and deleted the other , and “ tried out ” everybody 's suggestions generally , until we got at least the relief of witnessing at each rehearsal a different play . And steadily my manuscript was enriched with interlineations , to and beyond the verge of legibility , as steadily I substituted , for the speeches I had rewritten yesterday , the speeches which the actor ( having perfectly in mind the gist but not the phrasing of what was meant ) delivered naturally . This process made , at all events , for what we in particular wanted , which was a play that the League could stage for half an evening 's entertainment ; but it left existent not a shred of the rhetorical fripperies which I had in the beginning concocted , and it made of the actual first public performance a collaboration with almost as many contributing authors as though the production had been a musical comedy . And if only fate had gifted me with an exigent conscience and a turn for oratory , I would , I like to think , have publicly confessed , at that first public performance , to all those tributary clarifying rills to the play 's progress : but , as it was , vainglory combined with an aversion to “ speech-making ” to compel a taciturn if smirking acceptance of the curtain-call with which an indulgent audience flustered the nominal author of The Jewel Merchants .... Now , in any case , it is due my collaborators to tell you that The Jewel Merchants has amply fulfilled the purpose of its makers by being enacted to considerable applause ,— and is a pleasure to add that this succès d'estime was very little chargeable to anything which I contributed to the play . For another matter , I would here confess that The Jewel Merchants , in addition to its “ literary ” deficiencies , lacks moral fervor . It will , I trust , corrupt no reader irretrievably , to untraversable leagues beyond the last hope of redemption : but , even so , it is a frankly unethical performance . You must accept this resuscitated trio , if at all , very much as they actually went about Tuscany , in long ago discarded young flesh , when the one trait everywhere common to their milieu was the absence of any moral excitement over such-and-such an action 's being or not being “ wicked . ” This phenomenon of Renaissance life , as lived in Italy in particular , has elsewhere been discussed time and again , and I lack here the space , and the desire , either to explain or to apologize for the era 's delinquencies . I would merely indicate that this point of conduct is the fulcrum of The Jewel Merchants . The play presents three persons , to any one of whom the committing of murder or theft or adultery or any other suchlike interdicted feat , is just the risking of the penalty provided against the breaking of that especial law if you have the vile luck to be caught at it : and this to them is all that “ wickedness ” can mean . We nowadays are encouraged to think differently : but such dear privileges do not entitle us to ignore the truth that had any of these three advanced a dissenting code of conduct , it would , in the time and locality , have been in radical irreverence of the best-thought-of tenets . There was no generally recognized criminality in crime , but only a perceptible risk . So must this trio thriftily adhere to the accepted customs of their era , and regard an infraction of the Decalogue ( for an instance ) very much as we today look on a violation of our prohibition enactments . In fact , we have accorded to the Eighteenth Amendment almost exactly the status then reserved for Omnipotence . You found yourself confronted by occasionally enforced if obviously unreasonable supernal statutory decrees , which every one broke now and then as a matter of convenience : and every now and then , also , somebody was caught and punished , either in this world or in the next , without his ill-fortune 's involving any disgrace or particular reprehension . As has been finely said , righteousness and sinfulness were for the while “ in strange and dreadful peace with each other . The wicked man did not dislike virtue , nor the good man vice : the villain could admire a saint , and the saint could excuse a villain , in things which we often shrink from repeating , and sometimes recoil from believing . ” Such was the sixteenth-century Tuscan view of “ wickedness . ” I have endeavored to reproduce it without comment . So much of ink and paper and typography may be needed , I fear , to remind you , in a more exhortatory civilization , that Graciosa is really , by all the standards of her day , a well reared girl . To the prostitution of her body , whether with or without the assistance of an ecclesiastically acquired husband , she looks forward as unconcernedly as you must by ordinary glance out of your front window , to face a vista so familiar that the discovery of any change therein would be troubling . Meanwhile she wishes this sorrow-bringing Eglamore assassinated , as the obvious , the most convenient , and indeed the only way of getting rid of him : and toward the end of the play , alike for her and Guido , the presence of a corpse in her garden is merely an inconvenience without any touch of the gruesome . Precautions have , of course , to be taken to meet the emergency which has arisen : but in the dead body of a man per se , the lovers can detect nothing more appalling , or more to be shrunk from , than would be apparent if the lifeless object in the walkway were a dead flower . The thing ought to be removed , if only in the interest of tidiness , but there is no call to make a pother over it . As for our Guido , he is best kept conformable to modern tastes , I suspect , by nobody 's prying too closely into the earlier relations between the Duke and his handsome minion . The insistently curious may resort to history to learn at what price the favors of Duke Alessandro were secured and retained : it is no part of the play . Above all , though , I must remind you that the Duke is unspurred by malevolence . A twinge of jealousy there may be , just at first , to find his pampered Eglamore so far advanced in the good graces of this pretty girl , but that is hardly important . Thereafter the Duke is breaking no law , for the large reason that his preference in any matter is the only law thus far divulged to him . As concerns the man and the girl he discovers on this hill-top , they , in common with all else in Tuscany , are possessions of Duke Alessandro 's . They can raise no question as to how he “ ought ” to deal with them , for to your chattels , whether they be your finger rings or your subjects or your pomatum pots or the fair quires whereon you indite your verses , you cannot rationally he said to “ owe ” anything .... No , the Duke is but a spirited lad in quest of amusement : and Guido and Graciosa are the playthings with which , on this fine sunlit morning , he attempts to divert himself . This much being granted — and confessed ,— we let the play begin .</performance>

    <docImprint>Dumbarton Grange , June ,<date>1921</date>[ “ Alessandro de Medici is generally styled by the Italian authors the first duke of Florence ; but in this they are not strictly accurate . His title of duke was derived from Città , or Cività di Penna , and had been assumed by him several years before he obtained the direction of the Florentine state . It must also be observed , that , after the evasion of Eglamore , Duke Alessandro did not , as Robertson observes , ‘ enjoy the same absolute dominion as his family have retained to the present times , ’ ( Hist . Charles V. book v .) he being only declared chief or prince of the republic , and his authority being in some measure counteracted or restrained by two councils chosen from the citizens , for life , one of which consisted of forty-eight , and the other of two hundred members .

    <speaker>THE JEWEL MERCHANTS</speaker>
    <p>The play begins with the sound of a woman 's voice singing a song<stage>adapted from Rossetti 's version</stage>which is delivered to the accompaniment of a lute .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SONG</speaker>
    <p>Let me have dames and damsels richly clad To feed and tend my mirth , Singing by day and night to make me glad . Let me have fruitful gardens of great girth Filled with the strife of birds , With water-springs and beasts that house i ’ the earth . Let me seem Solomon for lore of words , Samson for strength , for beauty Absalom . Knights as my serfs be given ; And as I will , let music go and come , Till , when I will , I will to enter Heaven . As the singing ends , the curtain rises upon a corner of Balthazar Valori 's garden near the northern border of Tuscany . The garden is walled . There is a shrine in the wall : the tortured figure upon the crucifix is conspicuous . To the right stands a rather high-backed stone bench : by mounting from the seat to the top of the bench it is possible to scale the wall . To the left a crimson pennant on a pole shows against the sky . The period is 1533 , and a few miles southward the Florentines , after three years of formally recognizing Jesus Christ as the sole lord and king of Florence , have lately altered matters as profoundly as was possible by electing Alessandro de Medici to be their Duke .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA is seated upon the bench , with a lute . The girl is , to our</speaker>
    <p>modern taste , very quaintly dressed in gold-colored satin , with a short tight bodice , cut square and low at the neck , and with long full skirts . When she stands erect , her preposterous “ flowing ” sleeves , lined with sky blue , reach to the ground . Her blonde hair , of which she has a great deal , is braided , in the intricate early sixteenth fashion , under a jeweled cap and a veil the exact color of this hair . There is a call . Smiling , GRACIOSA answers this call by striking her lute . She pats straight her hair and gown , and puts aside the instrument . GUIDO appears at the top of the wall . All you can see of the handsome young fellow , in this posture , is that he wears a green skull-cap and a dark blue smock , the slashed sleeves of which are lined with green .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Ah , madonna ....</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>Welcome , Ser Guido . Your journey has been brief .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>It has not seemed brief to me .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>Why , it was only three days ago you told me it would be a fortnight before you came this way again .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Yes , but I did not then know that each day spent apart from you , Madonna</l>
     <l>Graciosa , would be a century in passing .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>Dear me , but your search must have been desperate !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p><stage>Who speaks , as almost always hereinafter , with sober enjoyment of the fact that he is stating the exact truth unintelligibly .</stage>Yes , my search is desperate .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>Did you find gems worthy of your search ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Very certainly , since at my journey 's end I find Madonna Graciosa , the chief jewel of Tuscany .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>Such compliments , Guido , make your speech less like a merchant 's than a courtier 's .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Ah , well , to balance that , you will presently find courtiers in Florence who will barter for you like merchants . May I descend ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>Yes , if you have something of interest to show me .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Am I to be welcomed merely for the sake of my gems ? You were more gracious , you were more beautifully like your lovely name , on the fortunate day that I first encountered you ... only six weeks ago , and only yonder , where the path crosses the highway . But now that I esteem myself your friend , you greet me like a stranger . You do not even invite me into your garden . I much prefer the manner in which you told me the way to the inn when I was an unknown passer-by . And yet your pennant promised greeting .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p><stage>With the smile of an exceptionally candid angel .</stage>Ah , Guido , I flew it the very minute the boy from the inn brought me your message !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Now , there is the greeting I had hoped for ! But how do you escape your father 's watch so easily ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>My father has no need to watch me in this lonely hill castle . Ever since I can remember I have wandered at will in the forest . My father knows that to me every path is as familiar as one of the corridors in his house ; and in no one of them did I ever meet anybody except charcoal-burners , and sometimes a nun from the convent , and — oh , yes !— you . But descend , friend Guido . Thus encouraged , GUIDO descends from the top of the wall to the top of the bench , and thence , via its seat , to the ground . You are thereby enabled to discover that his nether portions are clad in dark blue tights and soft leather shoes with pointed turned-up toes . It is also noticeable that he carries a jewel pack of purple , which , when opened , reveals an orange lining .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p><stage>With as much irony as the pleasure he takes in being again with this dear child permits .</stage>That “ Oh , yes , you ! ” is a very fitting reward for my devotion . For I find that nowadays I travel about the kingdom buying jewels less for my patrons at court than for the pleasure of having your eyes appraise them , and smile at me .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p><stage>With the condescension of a great lady .</stage>Guido , you have in point of fact been very kind to me , and very amusing , too , in my loneliness on the top of this hill .<stage>Drawing back the sleeve from her left arm , she reveals the trinket there .</stage>See , here is the turquoise bracelet I had from you the second time you passed . I wear it always — secretly .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>That is wise , for the turquoise is a talisman . They say that the woman who wears a turquoise is thereby assured of marrying the person whom she prefers .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>I do not know about that , nor do I expect to have much choice as to what rich nobleman marries me , but I know that I love this bracelet —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>In fact , they are handsome stones .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>Because it reminds me constantly of the hours which I have spent here with my lute —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Oh , with your lute !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>And with your pack of lovely jewels —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Yes , to be sure ! with my jewels .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>And with you .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>There is again my gracious lady . Now , in reward for that , you shall feast your eyes .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p><stage>All eagerness .</stage>And what have you to-day ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO opens his pack . She bends above it with hands outstretched</speaker>
    <p>GUIDO<stage>Taking out a necklace .</stage>For one thing , pearls , black pearls , set with a clasp of emeralds . See ! They will become you .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p><stage>Taking them , pressing them to her cheek .</stage>How cool ! But I — poor child of a poor noble — I cannot afford such .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Oh , I did not mean to offer them to you to-day . No , this string is intended for the Duke 's favorite , Count Eglamore .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p><stage>Stiffening .</stage>Count Eglamore ! These are for him ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>For Count Eglamore .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>Has the upstart such taste ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>If it be taste to appreciate pearls , then the Duke 's chief officer has excellent taste . He seeks them far and wide . He will be very generous in paying for this string .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA drops the pearls , in which she no longer delights . She returns</speaker>
    <p>to the bench , and sits down and speaks with a sort of disappointment .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>I am sorry to learn that this Eglamore is among your patrons .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p><stage>Still half engrossed by the contents of his pack . The man loves jewels equally for their value and their beauty .</stage>Oh , the nobles complain of him , but we merchants have no quarrel with Eglamore . He buys too lavishly .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>Do you think only of buying and selling , Guido ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>It is a pursuit not limited to us who frankly live by sale and purchase . Count Eglamore , for example , knows that men may be bought as readily as merchandise . It is one reason why he is so hated — by the unbought .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p><stage>Irritated by the title .</stage>Count Eglamore , indeed ! I ask in my prayers every night that some honest gentleman may contrive to cut the throat of this abominable creature .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p><stage>His hand going to his throat .</stage>You pray too much , madonna . Even very pious people ought to be reasonable .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p><stage>Rising from the bench .</stage>Have I not reason to hate the man who killed my kinsman ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p><stage>Rising from his gems .</stage>The Marquis of Cibo conspired , or so the court judged —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>I know nothing of the judgment . But it was this Eglamore who discovered the plot , if there indeed was any plot , and who sent my cousin Cibo to a death —<stage>pointing to the shrine</stage>— oh , to a death as horrible as that . So I hate him .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Yet you have never even seen him , I believe ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>And it would be better for him never to see me or any of my kin . My father , my uncles and my cousins have all sworn to kill him —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>So I have gathered . They remain among the unbought .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p><stage>Returning , sits upon the bench , and speaks regretfully .</stage>But they have never any luck . Cousin Pietro contrived to have a beam dropped on Eglamore 's head , and it missed him by not half a foot —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Ah , yes , I remember .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>And Cousin Georgio stabbed him in the back one night , but the coward had on chain-armor under his finery —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>I remember that also .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>And Uncle Lorenzo poisoned his soup , but a pet dog got at it first . That was very unfortunate .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Yes , the dog seemed to think so , I remember .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>However , perseverance is always rewarded . So I still hope that one or another of my kinsmen will contrive to kill this Eglamore before I go to court .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p><stage>Sits at her feet .</stage>Has my Lord Balthazar yet set a day for that presentation ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>Not yet .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>I wish to have this Eglamore 's accounts all settled by that date .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>But in three months , Guido , I shall be sixteen . My sisters went to court when they were sixteen .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>In fact , a noble who is not rich cannot afford to continue supporting a daughter who is salable in marriage .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>No , of course not .<stage>She speaks in the most matter-of-fact tone possible . Then , more impulsively , the girl slips down from the bench , and sits by him on the around .</stage>Do you think I shall make as good a match as my sisters , Guido ? Do you think some great rich nobleman will marry me very soon ? And shall I like the court ! What shall I see there ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Marvels . I think — yes , I am afraid that you will like them .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>And Duke Alessandro — shall I like him ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Few courtiers have expressed dislike of him in my presence .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>Do you like him ? Does he too buy lavishly ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Eh , madonna ! some day , when you have seen his jewels —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>Oh ! I shall see them when I go to court ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Yes , he will show them to you , I think , without fail , for the Duke loves beauty in all its forms . So he will take pleasure in confronting the brightness of your eyes with the brightness of the four kinds of sapphires , of the twelve kinds of rubies , and of many extraordinary pearls —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p><stage>With eyes shining , and lips parted .</stage>Oh !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>And you will see his famous emerald necklace , and all his diamonds , and his huge turquoises , which will make you ashamed of your poor talisman —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>He will show all these jewels to me !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p><stage>Looking at her , and still smiling thoughtfully .</stage>He will show you the very finest of his gems , assuredly . And then , worse still , he will be making verses in your honor .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>It would be droll to have a great duke making songs about me !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>It is a preposterous feature of Duke Alessandro 's character that he is always making songs about some beautiful thing or another .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>Such strange songs , Guido ! I was singing over one of them just before you came ,— Let me have dames and damsels richly clad To feed and tend my mirth , Singing by day and night to make me glad — But I could not quite understand it . Are his songs thought good ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>The songs of a reigning duke are always good .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>And is he as handsome as people report ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Tastes differ , of course —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>And is he —?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>I have a portrait of the Duke . It does not , I think , unduly flatter him . Will you look at it ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>Yes , yes !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p><stage>Drawing out a miniature on a chain .</stage>Here is the likeness .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>But how should you —?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p><stage>Seeing her surprise .</stage>Oh , it was a gift to me from his highness for a special service I did him , and as such must be treasured .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>Perhaps , then , I shall see yon at court , Messer Guido , who are the friend of princes ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>If you do , I ask only that in noisy Florence you remember this quiet garden .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p><stage>Looks at him silently , then glances at the portrait . She speaks with evident disappointment .</stage>Is this the Duke ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>You may see his arms on it , and on the back his inscription .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>Yes , but —<stage>looking at the portrait again</stage>— but ... he is ... so ...</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>You are astonished at his highness ’ coloring ? That he inherits from his mother . She was , you know , a blackamoor .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>And my sisters wrote me he was like a god !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Such observations are court etiquette .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p><stage>With an outburst of disgust .</stage>Take it back ! Though how can you bear to look at it , far less to have it touching you ! And only yesterday I was angry because I had not seen the Duke riding past !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Seen him ! here ! riding past !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>Old Ursula told me that the Duke had gone by with twenty men , riding down toward the convent at the border . And I flung my sewing-bag straight at her head because she had not called me .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>That was idle gossip , I fancy . The Duke rarely rides abroad without my —<stage>he stops</stage>— without my lavish patron Eglamore , the friend of all honest merchants .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>But that abominable Eglamore may have been with him . I heard nothing to the contrary .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>True , madonna , true . I had forgotten you did not see them .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>No . What is he like , this Eglamore ? Is he as appalling to look at as the</l>
     <l>Duke ?</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Madonna ! but wise persons do not apply such adjectives to dukes . And wise persons do not criticize Count Eglamore 's appearance , either , now that Eglamore is indispensable to the all-powerful Duke of Florence .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>Indispensable ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>It is thanks to the Eglamore whom you hate that the Duke has ample leisure to indulge in recreations which are reputed to be — curious .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>I do not understand you , Guido .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>That is perhaps quite as well .<stage>Attempting to explain as much as is decently expressible .</stage>To be brief , madonna , business annoys the Duke .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>Why ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>It interferes with the pursuit of all the beautiful things he asks for in that song .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>But how does that make Eglamore indispensable ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Eglamore is an industrious person who affixes seals , and signs treaties , and musters armies , and collects revenues , upon the whole , quite as efficiently as Alessandro would be capable of doing these things .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>So Duke Alessandro merely makes verses ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>And otherwise amuses himself as his inclinations prompt , while Eglamore rules Tuscany — and the Tuscans are none the worse off on account of it .<stage>He rises , and his hand goes to the dagger at his belt .</stage>But is not that a horseman ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p><stage>She too has risen , and is now standing on the bench , looking over the wall .</stage>A solitary rider , far down by the convent , so far away that he seems hardly larger than a scarlet dragon-fly .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>I confess I wish to run no risk of being found here , by your respected father or by your ingenious cousins and uncles .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p><stage>She turns , but remains standing upon the bench .</stage>I think your Duke is much more dangerous looking than any of them . Heigho ! I can quite foresee that I shall never fall in love with this Duke .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>A prince has means to overcome all obstacles .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>No . It is unbefitting and a little cowardly for Duke Alessandro to shirk the duties of his station for verse-making and eternal pleasure-seeking . Now if I were Duke —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>What would you do ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p><stage>Posturing a little as she stands upon the bench .</stage>If I were duke ? Oh ... I would grant my father a pension ... and I would have Eglamore hanged ... and I would purchase a new gown of silvery green —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>In which you would be very ravishingly beautiful . His tone has become rather ardent , and he is now standing nearer to her than the size of the garden necessitates . So GRACIOSA demurely steps down from the bench , and sits at the far end .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>And that is all I can think of . What would you do if you were duke ,</l>
     <l>Messer Guido ?</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p><stage>Who is now sitting beside her at closer quarters than the length of the bench quite strictly demands .</stage>I ? What would I do if I were a great lord instead of a tradesman !<stage>Softly .</stage>I think you know the answer , madonna .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>Oh , you would make me your duchess , of course . That is quite understood . But I was speaking seriously , Guido .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>And is it not a serious matter that a pedler of crystals should have dared to love a nobleman 's daughter ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p><stage>Delighted .</stage>This is the first I have heard of it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>But you are perfectly right . It is not a serious matter . That I worship you is an affair which does not seriously concern any person save me in any way whatsoever . Yet I think that knowledge of the fact would put your father to the trouble of sharpening his dagger .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>Ye-es . But not even Father would deny that you were showing excellent taste .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Indeed , I am not certain that I do worship you ; for in order to adore whole-heartedly the idolater must believe his idol to be perfect .<stage>Taking her hand .</stage>Now your nails are of an ugly shape , like that of little fans . Your nose is nothing to boast of . And your mouth is too large . I do not admire these faults , for faults they are undoubtedly —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Do they make me very ugly ? I know that I have not a really good mouth ,</l>
     <l>Guido , but do you think it is positively repulsive ?</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>No .... Then , too , I know that you are vain and self-seeking , and look forward contentedly to the time when your father will transfer his ownership of your physical attractions to that nobleman who offers the highest price for them .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>But we daughters of the poor Valori are compelled to marry — suitably . We have only the choice between that and the convent yonder .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>That is true , and nobody disputes it . Still , you participate in a monstrous bargain , and I would prefer to have you exhibit distaste for it . Bending forward , GUIDO draws from his jewel pack the string of pearls , and this he moodily contemplates , in order to evince his complete disinterestedness . The pose has its effect . GRACIOSA looks at him for a moment , rises , draws a deep breath , and speaks with a sort of humility .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>And to what end , Guido ? What good would weeping do ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p><stage>Smiling whimsically .</stage>I am afraid that men do not always love according to the strict laws of logic .<stage>He drops the pearls , and , rising , follows her .</stage>I desire your happiness above all things , yet to see you so abysmally untroubled by anything which troubles me is — another matter .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>But I am not untroubled , Guido .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>No ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>No .<stage>Rather tremulously .</stage>Sometimes I sit here dreading my life at court . I want never to leave my father 's bleak house . I fear that I may not like the man who offers the highest price for me . And it seems as if the court were a horrible painted animal , dressed in bright silks , and shining with jewels , and waiting to devour me . Beyond the wall appears a hat of scarlet satin with a divided brim , which , rising , is revealed to surmount the head of an extraordinarily swarthy person , to whose dark skin much powder has only loaned the hue of death : his cheeks , however , are vividly carmined . This is all that the audience can now see of the young DUKE of FLORENCE , whose proximity the two in the garden are just now too much engrossed to notice . The DUKE looks from one to the other . His eyes narrow , his teeth are displayed in a wide grin ; he now understands the situation . He lowers his head as GRACIOSA moves .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>No , I am not untroubled . For I cannot fathom you , and that troubles me . I am very fond of you — and yet I do not trust you .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>You know that I love you .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>You tell me so . It pleases me to have you say it —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Madonna is candid this morning .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>Yes , I am candid . It does please me . And I know that for the sake of seeing me you endanger your life , for if my father heard of our meetings here he would have you killed .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Would I incur such risks without caring ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>No ,— and yet , somehow , I do not believe it is altogether for me that you care . The DUKE laughs . GUIDO starts , half drawing his dagger . GRACIOSA turns with an instinctive gesture of seeking protection . The DUKE 'S head and shoulders appear above the wall .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
    <p>And you will find , my friend , that the most charming women have just these awkward intuitions . The DUKE ascends the wall , while the two stand motionless and silent . When he is on top of the wall , GUIDO , who now remembers that omnipotence perches there , makes haste to serve it , and obsequiously assists the DUKE to descend . The DUKE then comes well forward , in smiling meditation , and hands first his gloves , then his scarlet cloak<stage>which you now perceive to be lined with ermine and sable in four stripes</stage>to GUIDO , who takes them as a servant would attend his master . The removal of this cloak reveals the DUKE to be clad in a scarlet satin doublet , which has a high military collar and sleeves puffed with black . His tights also are of scarlet , and he wears shining soft black riding-boots . Jewels glisten at his neck . About his middle , too , there is a metallic gleaming , for he is equipped with a noticeably long sword and a dagger . Such is the personage who now addresses himself more explicitly to GRACIOSA .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
    <p><stage>Sitting upon the bench , very much at his ease while the others stand uncomfortably before him .</stage>Yes , madonna , I suspect that Eglamore here cares greatly for the fact that you are Balthazar Valori 's daughter , and cousin to the late Marquis of Cibo .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p><stage>Just in bewilderment .</stage>Eglamore !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
    <p>For Cibo left many kinsmen . These still resent the circumstance that the matching of his wits against Eglamore 's wits earned for Cibo an unpleasantly public death-bed . So they pursue their feud against Eglamore with vexatious industry . And Eglamore goes about in hourly apprehension of another falling beam , another knife-thrust in the back , or another plate of poison .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p><stage>She comprehends now .</stage>Eglamore !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
    <p><stage>Who is pleased alike by Eglamore 's neat plan and by his own cleverness in unriddling it .</stage>But if rich Eglamore should make a stolen match with you , your father — good thrifty man !— could be appeased without much trouble . Your cousins , those very angry but penniless Valori , would not stay over-obdurate to a kinsman who had at his disposal so many pensions and public offices . Honor would permit a truce with their new cousin Eglamore , a truce very profitable to everybody .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>He said they must be bought somehow !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
    <p>Yes , Eglamore could bind them all to his interest within ten days . All could be bought at a stroke by marrying you . And Eglamore would be rid of the necessity of sleeping in chain-armor . Have I not unraveled the scheme correctly , Eglamore ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p><stage>Smiling and deferential .</stage>Your highness was never lacking in penetration .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA , at this , turns puzzled from one man to the other</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>GRACIOSA</l>
     <l>Are you —?</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
    <p>I am Alessandro de Medici , madonna .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>The Duke !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
    <p>A sadly neglected prince , who wondered over the frequent absences of his chief counselor , and secretly set spies upon him . Eglamore here will attest as much —<stage>As GRACIOSA draws away from GUIDO</stage>— or if you cannot believe Eglamore any longer in anything , I shall have other witnesses within the half-hour . Yes , my twenty cut-throats are fetching back for me a brace of nuns from the convent yonder . I can imagine that , just now , my cut-throats will be in your opinion more trustworthy witnesses than is poor Eglamore . And my stout knaves will presently assure you that I am the Duke .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p><stage>Suavely .</stage>It happens that not a moment ago we were admiring your highness ’ portrait .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>And so you are Count Eglamore . That is very strange . So it was the hand of Eglamore<stage>rubbing her hands as if to clean them</stage>that I touched just now . I thought it was the hand of my friend Guido . But I forget . There is no Guido . You are Eglamore . It is strange you should have been capable of so much wickedness , for to me you seem only a smirking and harmless lackey . The DUKE is watching as if at a play . He is aesthetically pleased by the girl 's anguish . GUIDO winces . As GRACIOSA begins again to speak , they turn facing her , so that to the audience the faces of both men are invisible .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>And it was you who detected — so you said — the Marquis of Cibo 's conspiracy . Tebaldeo was my cousin , Count Eglamore . I loved him . We were reared together . We used to play here in this garden . I remember how Tebaldeo once fetched me a wren 's nest from that maple yonder . I stood just here . I was weeping , because I was afraid he would fall . If he had fallen , if he had been killed then , it would have been the luckier for him . They say that he conspired . I do not know . I only know that by your orders , Count Eglamore , my playmate Tebaldeo was fastened to a cross , like that<stage>pointing to the shrine</stage>I know that his arms and legs were each broken in two places with an iron bar . I know that this cross was then set upon a pivot , so that it turned slowly . I know that my dear Tebaldeo died very slowly in the sunlit marketplace , while the cross turned , and turned , and turned . I know this was a public holiday ; the shopkeepers took holiday to watch him die , the boy who fetched me a wren 's nest from yonder maple . And I know that you are Eglamore , who ordered these things done .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>I gave orders for the Marquis of Cibo 's execution , as was the duty of my office . I did not devise the manner of his punishment . The punishment for Cibo 's crime was long ago fixed by our laws . All who attack the Duke 's person must die thus .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p><stage>Waves his excuses aside .</stage>And then you plan this masquerade . You plan to make me care for you so greatly that even when I know you to be Count Eglamore I must still care for you . You plan to marry me , so as to placate Tebaldeo 's kinsmen , so as to leave them — in your huckster 's phrase — no longer unbought . It was a fine bold stroke of policy , I know , to use me as a stepping-stone to safety . But was it fair to me ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Graciosa ... you shame me —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>Look you , Count Eglamore , I was only a child , playing here , alone , and not unhappy . Oh , was it fair , was it worth while to match your skill against my ignorance ?</p>

   <sp>
    <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
    <p>Fie , Donna Graciosa , you must not be too harsh with Eglamore —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>Think how unhappy I would be if even now I loved you , and how I would loathe myself !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
    <p>It is his nature to scheme , and he weaves his plots as inevitably as the spider does her web —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>But I am getting angry over nothing . Nothing has happened except that</l>
     <l>I have dreamed — of a Guido . And there is no Guido . There is only an</l>
     <l>Eglamore , a lackey in attendance upon his master .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
    <p>Believe me , it is wiser to forget this clever lackey — as I do — except when there is need of his services . I think that you have no more need to consider him — He takes the girl 's hand . GRACIOSA now looks at him as though seeing him for the first time . She is vaguely frightened by this predatory beast , but in the main her emotion is as yet bewilderment .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
    <p>For you are very beautiful , Graciosa . You are as slim as a lily , and more white . Your eyes are two purple mirrors in each of which I see a tiny image of Duke Alessandro .<stage>GUIDO takes a step forward , and the DUKE now addresses him affably .</stage>Those nuns they are fetching me are big high-colored wenches with cheeks like apples . It is not desirable that women should be so large . Such women do not inspire a poet . Women should be little creatures that fear you . They should have thin plaintive voices , and in shrinking from you should be as slight to the touch as a cobweb . It is not possible to draw inspiration from a woman 's beauty unless you comprehend how easy it would be to murder her .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p><stage>Softly , without expression .</stage>God , God ! The DUKE looks with delight at GRACIOSA , who stands bewildered and childlike .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
    <p>You fear me , do you not , Graciosa ? Your hand is soft and cold as the skin of a viper . When I touch it you shudder . I am very tired of women who love me , of women who are infatuated by my beauty . You , I can see , are not infatuated . To you my touch will always be a martyrdom , you will always loathe me . And therefore I shall not weary of you for a long while , because the misery and the helplessness of my lovely victim will incite me to make very lovely verses . He draws her to the bench , sitting beside her .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
    <p>Yes , Graciosa , you will inspire me . Your father shall have all the wealth and state that even his greedy imaginings can devise , so long as you can contrive to loathe me . We will find you a suitable husband — say , in Eglamore here . You shall have flattery and titles , gold and fine glass , soft stuffs and superb palaces and many lovely jewels — The DUKE glances down at the pedler 's pack .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
    <p>But Eglamore also has been wooing you with jewels . You must see mine , dear Graciosa .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p><stage>Without expression .</stage>Count Eglamore said that I must .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
    <p><stage>Raises the necklace , and lets it drop contemptuously .</stage>Oh , not such trumpery as this . I have in Florence gems which have not their fellows anywhere , gems which have not even a name , and the value of which is incalculable . I have jewels engendered by the thunder , jewels taken from the heart of the Arabian deer . I have jewels cut from the brain of a toad , and from the eyes of serpents . I have jewels which are authentically known to have fallen from the moon . Well , we will select the rarest , and have a pair of slippers encrusted with them , and in these slippers you shall dance for me , in a room that I know of —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p><stage>Without moving .</stage>Highness —!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
    <p>It will all be very amusing , for I think that she is now quite innocent , as pure as the high angels . Yes , it will be diverting to make her as I am . It will be an atrocious action that will inspire me to write lovelier verses than even I have ever written .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>She is a child —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
    <p>Yes , yes , a frightened child who cannot speak , who stays as still as a lark that has been taken in a snare . Why , neither of her sisters can compare with this , and , besides , the elder one had a quite ugly mole upon her thigh — But that old rogue Balthazar Valori has a real jewel to offer , this time . Well , I will buy it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Highness , I love this child —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
    <p>Ah , then you cannot ever be her husband . You would have suited otherwise . But we will find some other person of discretion — For a moment the two men regard each other in silence . The DUKE becomes aware that he is being opposed . His brows contract a little , but he rises from the bench rather as if in meditation than in anger . Then GUIDO drops the cloak and gloves he has been holding until this . His lackeyship is over .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>No !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
    <p>My friend , some long-faced people say you made a beast of me —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>No , I will not have it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
    <p>So do you beware lest the beast turn and rend you .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>I have never been too nice to profit by your vices . I have taken my thrifty toll of abomination . I have stood by contentedly , not urging you on , yet never trying to stay you as you waded deeper and ever deeper into the filth of your debaucheries , because meanwhile you left me so much power .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
    <p>Would you reshape your handiwork more piously ? Come , come , man , be content with it as I am . And be content with the kingdom I leave you to play with .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>It was not altogether I who made of you a brainsick beast . But what you are is in part my handiwork . Nevertheless , you shall not harm this child .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
    <p>“ Shall not ” is a delightfully quaint expression . I only regret that you are not likely ever to use it to me again .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>I know this means my ruin .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
    <p>Indeed , I must venture to remind you , Count Eglamore , that I am still a ruling prince —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>That is nothing to me .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
    <p>And that , where you are master of very admirable sentiments , I happen to be master of all Tuscany .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>At court you are the master . At your court in Florence I have seen many mothers raise the veil from their daughters ’ faces because you were passing . But here upon this hill-top I can see only the woman I love and the man who has insulted her .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
    <p>So all the world is changed , and Pandarus is transformed into Hector ! Your words are very sonorous words , dear Eglamore , but by what deeds do you propose to back them ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>By killing you , your highness .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
    <p>But in what manner ? By stifling me with virtuous rhetoric ? Hah , it is rather awkward for you — is it not — that our sumptuary laws forbid you merchants to carry swords ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p><stage>Draws his dagger .</stage>I think this knife will serve me , highness , to make earth a cleaner place .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
    <p><stage>Drawing his long sword .</stage>It would save trouble now to split you like a chicken for roasting ....<stage>He shrugs , and sheathes his sword . He unbuckles his sword-belt , and lays it aside .</stage>No , no , this farce ascends in interest . So let us play it fairly to the end . I risk nothing , since from this moment you are useless to me , my rebellious lackey —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>You risk your life , for very certainly I mean to kill you .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
    <p>Two go to every bargain , my friend . Now , if I kill you , it is always diverting to kill ; and if by any chance you should kill me , I shall at least be rid of the intolerable knowledge that to-morrow will be just like to-day . He draws his dagger . The two men engage warily but with determination , the DUKE presently advancing . GUIDO steps backward , and in the act trips over the pedler 's pack , and falls prostrate . His dagger flies from his hand . GRACIOSA , with a little cry , has covered her face . Nobody strikes an attitude , because nobody is conscious of any need to be heroic , but there is a perceptible silence , which is broken by the DUKE 'S quiet voice .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
    <p>Well ! am I to be kept waiting forever ? You were quicker in obeying my caprices yesterday . Get up , you muddy lout , and let us kill each other with some pretension of adroitness .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p><stage>Rising , with a sob .</stage>Ah ! He catches up the fallen dagger , and attacks the DUKE , this time with utter disregard of the rules of fence and his own safety . GUIDO drives the DUKE back . GUIDO is careless of defence , and desirous only to kill . The DUKE is wounded , and falls with a cry at the foot of the shrine . GUIDO utters a sort of strangled growl . He raises his dagger , intending to hack at and mutilate his antagonist , who is now unconscious . As GUIDO stoops , GRACIOSA , from behind him , catches his arm .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>He gave you your life .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO turns . He drops the weapon . He speaks with great gentleness , almost</speaker>
    <p>with weariness .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Madonna , the Duke is not yet dead . That wound is nothing serious .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>He spared your life .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>It is impossible to let him live .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>But I think he only voiced a caprice —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>I think so , too , but I know that all this madman 's whims are ruthless .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>But you have power —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Power ! I , who have attacked the Duke 's person ! I , who have done what your dead cousin merely planned to do !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>Guido —!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Living , this brain-sick beast will make of you his plaything — and , a little later , his broken , soiled and cast-by plaything . It is therefore necessary that I kill Duke Alessandro .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA moves away from him , and GUIDO rises</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>GRACIOSA</l>
     <l>And afterward — and afterward you must die just as Tebaldeo died !</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>That is the law , madonna . But what he said is true . I am useless to him , a rebellious lackey to be punished . Whether I have his life or no , I am a lost man .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>A moment since you were Count Eglamore , whom all our nobles feared —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Now there is not a beggar in the kingdom who would change lots with me . But at least I shall first kill this kingdom 's lord . He picks up his dagger .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>You are a friendless and hunted man , in peril of a dreadful death . But even so , you are not penniless . These jewels here are of great value —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO laughs , and hangs the pearls about her neck</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>GUIDO</l>
     <l>Do you keep them , then .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>There is a world outside this kingdom . You have only to make your way through the forest to be out of Tuscany .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p><stage>Coolly reflective .</stage>Perhaps I might escape , going north to Bologna , and then to Venice , which is at war with the Duke —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>I can tell you the path to Bologna .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>But first the Duke must die , because his death saves you .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>No , Guido ! I would have Eglamore go hence with hands as clean as possible .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Not even Eglamore would leave you at the mercy of this poet .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>How does that matter ! It is no secret that my father intends to market me as best suits his interests . And the great Duke of Florence , no less , would have been my purchaser ! You heard him , “ I will buy this jewel , ” he said . He would have paid thrice what any of my sisters ’ purchasers have paid . You know very well that my father would have been delighted .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p><stage>Since the truth of what she has just said is known to him by more startling proofs than she dreams of , he speaks rather bitterly , as he sheathes the dagger .</stage>And I must need upset the bargain between these jewel merchants !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p><stage>Lightly .</stage>“ No , I will not have it ! ” Count Eglamore must cry .<stage>Her hand upon his arm .</stage>My dear unthrifty pedler ! it cost you a great deal to speak those words .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>I had no choice . I love you .<stage>A pause . As GRACIOSA does not speak , GUIDO continues , very quiet at first .</stage>It is a theme on which I shall not embroider . So long as I thought to use you as an instrument I could woo fluently enough . Today I saw that you were frightened and helpless — oh , quite helpless . And something in me changed . I knew for the first time that I loved you . And I knew I was not clean as you are clean . I knew that I had more in common with this beast here than I had with you .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p><stage>Who with feminine practicality , while the man talks , has reached her decision .</stage>We daughters of the Valori are so much merchandise .... Heigho , since I cannot help it , since bought and sold I must be , one day or another , at least I will go at a noble price . Yet I do not think I am quite worth the wealth and power which you have given up because of me . So it will be necessary to make up the difference , dear , by loving you very much .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO takes her hands , only half-believing that he understands her</speaker>
    <p>meaning . He puts an arm about her shoulder , holding her at a distance , the better to see her face .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>You , who had only scorn to give me when I was a kingdom 's master ! Would you go with me now that I am homeless and friendless ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p><stage>Archly .</stage>But to me you do not seem quite friendless .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>Graciosa —!</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>And I doubt if you could ever find your way through the forest alone .<stage>But as she stands there with one hand raised to each of his shoulders her vindication is self-revealed , and she indicates her bracelet rather indignantly .</stage>Besides , what else is a poor maid to do , when she is burdened with a talisman that compels her to marry the man whom she — so very much — prefers ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p><stage>Drawing her to him .</stage>Ah , you shall not regret that foolish preference .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>But come ! There is a path —<stage>They are gathering up the pack and its contents , as GUIDO pauses by the DUKE .</stage>Is he —?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>He will not enter Hell to-day .<stage>The DUKE stirs .</stage>Already he revives , you see . So let us begone before his attendants come .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO lifts her to the top of the wall . He lifts up the pack</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>GRACIOSA</l>
     <l>My lute !</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p><stage>Giving it to her .</stage>So we may pass for minstrels on the road to Venice .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p>Yes , singing the Duke 's songs to pay our way .<stage>GUIDO climbs over the wall , and stands on the far side , examining the landscape beneath .</stage>Horsemen !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GUIDO</speaker>
    <p>The Duke 's attendants fetching him new women — two more of those numerous damsels that his song demands . They will revive this ruinous songmaker to rule over Tuscany more foolishly than Eglamore governed when Eglamore was a great lord .<stage>He speaks pensively , still looking down .</stage>It is a very rich and lovely country , this kingdom which a half-hour since lay in the hollow of my hand . Now I am empty-handed .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRACIOSA</speaker>
    <p><stage>With mocking reproach .</stage>Empty-handed ! She extends to him both her hands . GUIDO takes them , and laughs joyously , saying , “ Come ! ” as he lifts her down . There is a moment 's silence , then is heard the song and lute-playing with which the play began , growing ever more distant :... “ Knights as my serfs be given ; And as I will , let music go and come . ” The DUKE moves . The DUKE half raises himself at the foot of the crucifix .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
    <p>Eglamore ! I am hurt . Help me , Eglamore !</p>
