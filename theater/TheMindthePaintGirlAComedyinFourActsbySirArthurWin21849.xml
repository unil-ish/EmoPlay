    <head type="act">THE FIRST ACT</head>
    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>The scene is a drawing-room , prettily but somewhat showily decorated . The walls are papered with a design representing large clusters of white and purple lilac . The furniture is covered with a chintz of similar pattern , and the curtains , carpet , and lamp-shades correspond .</stage>
     <stage>In the wall facing the spectator are two windows , and midway between the windows there is the entrance to a conservatory . The conservatory , which is seen beyond , is of the kind that is built out over the portico of a front-door , and is plentifully stocked with flowers and hung with a velarium and green sun-blinds . In the right-hand wall there is another window and , nearer the spectator , a console-table supporting a high mirror ; and in the wall on the left , opposite the console-table , there is a double-door opening into the room , the further half of which only is used .</stage>
     <stage>In the entrance to the conservatory , to the right , there is a low , oblong tea-table at which are placed three small chairs ; and near-by , on the left , are a grand-piano and a music-stool . Against the piano there is a settee , and on the extreme left , below the door , there is an arm-chair with a little round table beside it . At the right-hand window in the wall at the back is another settee , and facing this window and settee there is a smaller arm-chair .</stage>
     <stage>Not far from the fire-place there is a writing-table with a telephone-instrument upon it . A chair stands at the writing-table , its back to the window in the wall on the right ; and in front of the table , opposing the settee by the piano , there is a third settee . On the left of this settee , almost in the middle of the room , is an arm-chair ; and closer to the settee , on its right , are two more arm-chairs . Other articles of furniture — a cabinet , “ occasional ” chairs , etc ., etc .— occupy spaces against the walls .</stage>
     <stage>On the piano , on the console-table and cabinet , on the settee at the back , on the round table , and upon the floor , stand huge baskets of flowers , and other handsome floral devices in various forms , with cards attached to them ; and lying higgledy-piggledy upon the writing-table are a heap of small packages , several little cases containing jewellery , and a litter of paper and string . The packages and the cases of jewellery are also accompanied by cards or letters .</stage>
     <stage>A fierce sunlight streams down upon the velarium , and through the green blinds , in the conservatory .</stage>
    </stage>
    <stage>Note : Throughout , “ right ” and “ left ” are the spectators ’ right and left , not the actor 's .</stage>
    <stage>LORD FARNCOMBE , his gloves in his hand , is seated in the arm-chair in the middle of the room . He is a simple-mannered , immaculately dressed young man in his early twenties , his bearing and appearance suggesting the soldier . He rises expectantly as GLADYS , a flashy parlourmaid in a uniform , shows in LIONEL ROPER , a middle-aged individual of the type of the second-class City man .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p><stage>To FARNCOMBE .</stage>Hul-lo ! I 'm in luck ! Just the chap I 'm hunting for .<stage>Shaking hands with FARNCOMBE .</stage>How d'ye do , Lord Farncombe ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>How are you , Roper ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GLADYS</speaker>
     <p><stage>To ROPER , languidly .</stage>I 'll tell Mrs. Upjohn you 're here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p>Ta .<stage>GLADYS withdraws .</stage>Phew , it 's hot !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>Miss Parradell 's out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taking off his gloves .</stage>She wo n't be long , I dare say .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>I 've brought her a few flowers .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p>Have you ? I 've sent her a trifle of jewellery .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Glancing at the writing-table .</stage>She seems to have received a lot of jewellery .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Bustling across to the table .</stage>By Jove , does n't she ! Ah , there 's my brooch !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Modestly .</stage>I did n't consider I 'd a right to offer her anything but flowers , on so slight an acquaintance .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Exactly ; but I 'm an old friend , you know .</l>
      <stage>Turning to FARNCOMBE .</stage>
      <l>Perhaps , by her next birthday ——</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>I hope so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Approaching FARNCOMBE and taking him by the lapel of his coat .</stage>
      <l>What I want to say to you is , doing anything to-night ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>I — I shall be at the theatre .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p>Oh , we shall all be at the theatre , to shout Many Happy Returns . Later , I mean .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>Nothing that I can n't get out of .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p>Good . Look here . Smythe is giving her a bit of supper in the foyer after the show , a dance on the stage to follow . About five-and-twenty people . ‘ Ull you come ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>If Mr. Smythe is kind enough to ask me ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p>He does ask you , through me . He 's left all the arrangements to me and Morrie Cooling . Carlton never did anything in his life ; I egged him on to this . I 've been sweating at it since eleven o'clock this morning . Have n't been near the City ; not near it . Well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p><stage>His eyes glowing .</stage>I shall be delighted .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p>Splendid . Been trying to get on to you all day . I 've called twice at your club and at St. James 's Place .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>Sorry you 've had so much trouble .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Dropping on to the settee in front of the writing-table and wiping his brow .</stage>There 'll be the Baron , Sam de Castro , Bertie Fulkerson , Stew Heneage , Jerry Grimwood , Dwarf Kennedy , Colonel and Mrs. Stidulph — Dolly Ensor that was — and ourselves , besides Cooling and Vincent Bland and the pick o ’ the Company . Catani does the food and drink . I do n't believe I 've forgotten a single thing .<stage>With a change of tone , pointing to the arm-chair in the middle of the room .</stage>Sit down a minute .<stage>FARNCOMBE sits and ROPER edges nearer to him .</stage>Are you going to wait to see Lily this afternoon ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>I — I should like to .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p>Because if Jeyes should happen to drop in while you 're here ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>Captain Jeyes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p>Nicko Jeyes — or if you knock up against him to-night at the theatre — mum about this .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>About the supper ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Nodding .</stage>Um . We do n't want Nicko Jeyes ; we simply do n't want him . And if he heard that you and some of the boys are coming , he might wonder why he is n't included .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>He strikes me as being rather a surly , ill-conditioned person .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p>A regular loafer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>He appears to live at Catani 's . I never go there without meeting him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p>Exactly . Catani 's and a top , back bedroom in Jermyn Street , and hanging about the Pandora ; that 's Nicko Jeyes 's life .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>He 's an old friend of Mrs. Upjohn 's and Miss Parradell 's too , is n't he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Evasively .</stage>Known ‘ em some time . That 's it ; Lily 's so faithful to her old friends .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>You ought n't to complain of that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p>Oh , but I 'm a real friend . I 've always been a patron of the musical drama — it 's my fad ; and I 've kept an eye on Lily from the moment she sprang into prominence —<stage>singing</stage>“ Mind the paint ! Mind the paint ! ” — looked after her like a father . Uncle Lal she calls me .<stage>Reassuringly .</stage>I 'm a married man , you know ;<stage>FARNCOMBE nods</stage>but the wife has plenty to occupy her with the kids and she leaves the drama to me . She prefers Bexhill .<stage>Leaning forward and speaking with great earnestness .</stage>Farncombe , what a charming creature !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Innocently .</stage>Mrs. Roper ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p>No , no , no ; Lily .<stage>Hastily .</stage>Oh , and so 's my missus , for that matter , when she chooses . But Lily Upjohn ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a low voice .</stage>Beautiful ; perfectly beautiful .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p>Yes , and as good as she 's beautiful ; you take it from me .<stage>With a wave of the hand .</stage>Well , if you see Jeyes , you wo n't ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>Not a word .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rising and walking away to the left .</stage>I 've warned the others .<stage>Returning to FARNCOMBE who has also risen .</stage>By-the-bye , if Lily should mention the supper in the course of conversation , remember , she 's not in the conspiracy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>Conspiracy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p>To shunt Nicko . We 're letting her think there are to be no outsiders .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Becoming slightly puzzled by ROPER 'S manner .</stage>Why , would she very much like Captain Jeyes to be asked ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rather impatiently .</stage>Have n't I told you , once you 're a friend of Lil 's ——!<stage>Looking towards the door .</stage>Is this Ma ?<stage>MRS. UPJOHN enters .</stage>Hul-lo , Ma !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. UPJOHN</speaker>
     <p><stage>A podgy little , gaily dressed woman of five-and-fifty with a stupid , good-humoured face .</stage>‘ Ullo , Uncle !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p>Lord Farncombe ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. UPJOHN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Advancing and shaking hands with FARNCOMBE .</stage>Glad to see you ‘ ere again . You ‘ ave been before , ‘ ave n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>Last week .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. UPJOHN</speaker>
     <p>Of course ; you came with Mr. Bertie Fulkerson . But somebody or other 's always poppin ’ in .<stage>Pleasantly .</stage>Lil sees too many , I say . It 's tirin ’ for ‘ er . Wo n't you set ?</p>

     <speaker>MRS. UPJOHN</speaker>
     <p>No , nor anybody else . That 's what I tell ‘ er . Why waste your time givin ’ settin 's to a risin ’ young artist when the big men ‘ ud go down on their ‘ ands and knees to do you ? But that 's Lil all over . She 's the best-natured girl in the world , and so she gets imposed on all round .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p>Yes , but they 're not all Farncombes and they 're not all marrying men . I 'm prepared to bet my boots that if Lil and young Farncombe could be thrown together ——!<stage>Sitting on the settee in front of the writing-table as MRS.

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. UPJOHN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Placidly .</stage>Where 's the use o ’ talkin ’ it over ? It 's wastin ’ one 's breath .<stage>Moving to the settee by the piano .</stage>My Lil does n't want to marry — any'ow not yet awhile ; she 's ‘ appy and contented as she is .<stage>Sitting and smoothing out her skirt .</stage>When she does , I s'pose it 'll be the Captain .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. UPJOHN</speaker>
     <p>Oh , do n't say that , Uncle .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p>I do say it . The disappointment ‘ ud be more than I could stand . Selfish , designing beggar !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. UPJOHN</speaker>
     <p>Now , no low abuse .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p>A fellow who gets on the soft side of Lil before she 's out of her teens — before she 's made any position to speak of ; and when she has made a position , and he 's practically on his uppers , sticks to her like a limpet !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. UPJOHN</speaker>
     <p>She sticks to ‘ im , too . It meant a deal to Lil in ‘ er ‘ umble days , reck'lect — receivin ’ attentions from a gentleman in the army . She does n't forget that .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Jumping up and walking about .</stage>It 's cruel ; that 's what it is — it 's cruel .

It 's cruel !</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Ho , ho !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. UPJOHN</speaker>
     <p>The ideer was , when ‘ e shirked goin ’ to India an ’ gave up soldierin ’ , so as to be near ‘ er , that ‘ e should get something to do in London ; then they were to be engaged .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sarcastically .</stage>Oh , to be just , I admit he 's in no hurry . He 's been a whole year looking for something to do in London — looking for it at Catani 's and at the Pandora bars !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. UPJOHN</speaker>
     <p>‘ E ‘ as to be on the spot at night , to bring Lil ‘ ome after ‘ er work .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p>Exactly ! And when a decent , eligible young chap comes along , and means business , he 's choked off by finding Nicko Jeyes in possession .<stage>Stopping before MRS. UPJOHN .</stage>But , I say !</p>

     <p><stage>Sitting on the settee in front of the writing-table .</stage>All said an ’ done , to be Lady F ., with no need to work if you 're not disposed to , is better than bein ’ Mrs. Captain Jeyes an ’ ‘ avin ’ to linger on the stage , p'r ' aps , till you drop , to ‘ elp keep the pot a ’ boilin ’ .<stage>Opening her eyes widely .</stage>Lady F .!</p>

     <p>There 's generally a rumpus in sech cases .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p>Why , Ma , these tiptop families ought to feel jolly grateful that we 're mixing the breed for them a bit . Look at the two lads who 've married Gwennie Harker and Maidie Trevail — Kinterton and Glenroy ; and Fawcus — Sir George Fawcus — Eva Shafto 's husband ; they have n't a chin or a forehead between ‘ em , and their chests are as narrow as a ten-inch plank .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. UPJOHN</speaker>
     <p>Quite true .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p>Farncombe himself , he 's inclined to be weedy . I maintain it 's a grand thing for our English nobs that their slips of sons have taken to marrying young women of the stamp of Maidie Trevail and Gwennie Harker — or Lil ; keen-witted young women full of the joy of life , with strong frames , beautiful hair and fine eyes , and healthy pink gums and big white teeth . Sneer at the Pandora girls ! Great Scot , it 's my belief that the Pandora girls 'll be the salvation of the aristocracy in this country in the long run !</p>

    <stage>CAPTAIN NICHOLAS JEYES lounges in . He is a man of about five-and-thirty , already slightly grey-haired , who has gone to seed . ROPER sits in the chair in the middle of the room rather guiltily and MRS. UPJOHN puts on a propitiatory grin .</stage>

     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rising and touching his arm .</stage>Oh , Vincent !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She looks round , to assure herself that she is unobserved . MRS. UPJOHN and ROPER are seated at the tea-table with their heads together , talking ; JIMMIE is at the piano , fingering out a piece of music ; JEYES is half hidden in the arm-chair facing the settee at the back . LILY tiptoes to the writing-table and seats herself there as GLADYS reappears showing in the BARON VON RETTENMAYER .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VON RETTENMAYER</speaker>
     <p><stage>A tall , fair young man of three-and-thirty , speaking in thick , guttural tones — advancing to LILY .</stage>Aha , goddess !<stage>Gladys withdraws .</stage>Many habby returns of the day !</p>

    </sp>
    <stage>VON RETTENMAYER laughs . LILY has quickly opened a drawer in the writing-table and produced a cheque-book . After another glance over her shoulder , she sweeps the presents aside and writes . Then she replaces the cheque-book , rises , and returns to BLAND . Again there is a loud guffaw from VON RETTENMAYER in response to some sally of JIMMIE 'S .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>To BLAND , folding a cheque and slipping it into his hand .</stage>

     <p><stage>In a whisper .</stage>Do n't fill it in for more than you can help . I 'm not over flush .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He deliberately tears the cheque into four pieces and , looking at her steadily , puts them into his waistcoat-pocket .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLAND</speaker>
     <p><stage>As he does so .</stage>I 'll keep those , Lil , for as long as I keep anything .</p>

    <stage>GLADYS enters with SAM DE CASTRO . GLADYS is carrying a lace-edged table-cloth which , assisted by MRS. UPJOHN , she proceeds to lay upon the tea-table .</stage>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JIMMIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>To everybody .</stage>It was my first morning at the Pandora . They 'd had me up from Harrogate in a hurry , to take Gwennie Harker 's place . I 'd been playing her part in the Number Two Co. in the country ; and she 'd left ‘ em in a hole , to get married to a stupid lord ——<stage>To FARNCOMBE , finding him standing near her .</stage>Sorry . I was to have only one rehearsal ;<stage>clenching her fist</stage>and , oh , did n't they treat me abominably ! Miss Ensor was late and we were all hanging about on the stage , waiting for her . I 've never felt so cold in my life , or so lonely . Not a word of welcome , not a nod , from a single soul ; simply a blank stare occasionally from a haughty beauty with a curled lip ! And at last , when I was on the point of howling , I became conscious that somebody was watching me — a tall , pretty thing in a lavender frock ——</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JIMMIE</speaker>
     <p>I caught her eye , and she came straight over to me and sat down beside me . “ Shaky ? ” she said . “ A corpse , ” I said . And she quietly laid hold of my hand and held it till Dolly Ensor condescended to stroll in . And when I got up I asked her who she was , and she told me . “ Oh , my God , ” I said , “ I 'll never forget your kindness ! Why , of course , you 're the ‘ Mind the Paint ’ girl ——! ”</p>

    </sp>
    <stage>BLAND seats himself at the piano and thumps out the air of the refrain of “ Mind the Paint . ” The three men , mouthing the time silently , wave their arms , and LILY 'S head and body move from side to side .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLAND</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a groan .</stage>Ugh ! Is there anything more ancient than a four-year-old comic song ?<stage>Playing a few bars of the melody of the song .</stage>Shade of Nineveh and all the buried cities !</p>

     </lg>
    </sp>
    <stage>BLAND plays the introductory symphony and then pauses . Then she sings , he accompanying her . In a moment or two , the song comes back to her readily and she gives it with great witchery and allurement . JEYES starts up and goes to the window in the wall on the right and looks out .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Singing .</stage>
      <l>I 've a very charming dwelling ,</l>
      <stage>You know where without the telling</stage>
      <l>Decorated in a style that 's rather quaint !</l>
      <l>Smart and quaint !</l>
      <l>When you pay my house a visit ,</l>
      <l>You may scrutinise or quiz it ,</l>
      <l>But you must n't touch the paint !</l>
      <l>Brand-new paint !</l>
      <l>Mind the paint ! Mind the paint !</l>
      <stage>No matter whether Maple 's bills are settled or they ai n't !</stage>
      <l>Once you smear it or you scratch it ,</l>
      <l>It 's impossible to match it ;</l>
      <l>So take care , please , of the paint — of the paint !</l>

    <stage>Rising and coming to the middle of the room , LILY repeats the refrain , dancing to it gracefully . JIMMIE also rises and she , ROPER , VON RETTENMAYER , and DE CASTRO join in the chorus and the dance , the three men very extravagantly . FARNCOMBE looks on , enraptured , while MRS. UPJOHN beats time with her hands .</stage>

      <l>I 'm possessed of all the graces ,</l>
      <l>Oh , a perfect dr-r-r-ream my face is !</l>
      <stage>It may owe to Art a trifle or it may n't H 'm , it may n't !</stage>
      <l>And I 'll cry out for assistance .</l>
      <l>Should you fail to keep your distance ,</l>
      <l>Goodness gracious , mind the paint !</l>
      <l>Mind the paint !</l>
      <l>Mind the paint ! Mind the paint !</l>
      <l>A girl is not a sinner just because she 's not a saint !</l>
      <l>But my heart shall hold you dearer —</l>
      <l>You may come a little nearer —</l>
      <l>If you 'll only mind the paint — mind the paint !</l>

    <stage>The refrain is repeated as before , MRS. UPJOHN rising and taking a share in it . Then LILY drops on to the settee before the writing-table , laughing and holding up her hands in protest .</stage>

     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>Roper and your mother told me about the supper . You did n't .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Ha , ha ! You were in such a vile mood last night , coming home .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>Who will there be to dance with to-night ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>The men of the Company .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>That does n't sound very inspiring .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Rather school-treaty , is n't it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>Nobody from outside ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>No ; it 's to be only the men in the theatre and the principal ladies .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>Roper 's going .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Uncle Lal ? Oh , well , he 's hardly from outside .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>And de Castro .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Sam ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sure of it , from something I heard him say just now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Sam used to finance Carlton . I suppose they reckon him one of us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sitting in the chair in the middle of the room .</stage>Smythe might have extended the compliment to me , Lil . He knows how I stand towards you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>Awfully sorry ; I can n't help it .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Twining his fingers together .</stage>You see , if Roper and de Castro are asked , there may be others .</p>

     <speaker>LILY</speaker>

     <p><stage>With a set jaw .</stage>Some of the more juvenile “ boys , ” perhaps .<stage>Examining his nails .</stage>Lil .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>What ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>When did you make the acquaintance of the young sprig o ’ the nobility who 's been here this afternoon ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Lord Farncombe ? Bertie brought him and introduced him one day last week .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>Ha ! He 's at your feet now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Phuh !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Oh , you may “ phuh ” ! He 's in front every blessed night . There he sits ,</l>
      <l>Row B ., three stalls from the end , prompt side !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>There are a few good-looking girls at the Pandora besides your humble servant .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>Rubbish ! His glass follows you all over the stage . I watched him talking to you in this room ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Raising herself .</stage>Did you indeed !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Beating his clenched hands upon the arms of his chair .</stage>God in heaven ! First it 's one , then it 's another , chasing you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Putting her feet to the ground .</stage>Oh , you 're maddening , Nicko ! You are ; you 're maddening . Last night it was Stewie Heneage you chose to be jealous of , simply because you 'd heard him sounding my praises at Catani 's ! You almost broke the window of the car , you went on so !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>I confess I object to Heneage , or any man , raving about you at the top of his voice in a public place .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Sakes alive , why should n't Stewie rave about me in a public place , if he feels like it ! I belong to the public . He might rave about a girl who 's a jolly sight less deserving of being raved about , as a girl and an artist , than I am .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>Well , we 'll dismiss Heneage .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Yes , exit Stewie and enter somebody else for you fuss and fume about . This afternoon it 's Lord Farncombe , and to-morrow it 'll be a fresh person altogether . One ‘ ud think , to hear you , that I do n't know how to take care of myself , and of any poor boy who loses his head over me !<stage>Rising and walking away .</stage>You 're growing worse and worse with your jealousy , Nicko . Stop it ! I 'm surprised at you , after all these years ! It 's beginning to fret me , and that 's bad for my spirits and bad for me in business .<stage>At the tea-table , grabbing a piece of bread-and-butter and biting at it .</stage>And now you 're making me spoil my dinner —<stage>relenting</stage>and that 's not good for me either , you brute !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>His hands hanging loosely between his knees , sighing heavily .</stage>
      <l>Oh ,</l>
      <l>Lily , Lily ——!</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Yes , oh , Lily , Lily !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>Why — why do n't you put me out of my misery ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Munching .</stage>Poison you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>Marry me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Behind his chair .</stage>Marry you ?<stage>Taking his handkerchief from his breast-pocket and wiping her fingers upon it — sarcastically .</stage>Have you come to tell me you 've got some work to do at last ? Break it gently , Nicko ; the shock might be too great for me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I 'd find a billet soon enough , Lil , if only I 'd an incentive to hunt for it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Incentive ! You had an incentive twelve months ago , when I was willing to engage myself to you absolutely if you could obtain a good secretaryship or something of the sort .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>I — I 've no fancy for a beggarly secretaryship .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>No ; all you 've a fancy for , seemingly , is for living on your unfortunate people .<stage>Throwing him his handkerchief and leaving him .</stage>How a man of your age can rest satisfied with being a burden to others passes my dull comprehension !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>I — I have been a bit slack , I own — I have been a bit leisurely ; but ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Inspecting some of the flowers about the room .</stage>Nicko , that pendant , or whatever it is , you 've given me — I do n't want to hurt you , but I wo n't accept it . You take it away with you ; do you hear ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Not heeding her , weakly .</stage>Lil ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>I 'm in earnest ; you remove it from off my premises .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>Lil —<stage>she returns to him</stage>my eldest brother — Robert —<stage>looking up at her</stage>Bob —<stage>She nods inquiringly .</stage>Bob 's at me to go out to Rhodesia , to manage a group of stock farms he 's interested in near Bulawayo .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , why do n't you go ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Forlornly .</stage>Rhodesia ! Bulawayo !<stage>Looking up at her again with a dismal smile .</stage>Come with me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Do n't be absurd .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rising and putting his hands upon her shoulders .</stage>No , you would n't care a straw — not a brass farthing — if I did go , would yer !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Softening again .</stage>Stuff ! I should miss you horribly .<stage>Toying with a button of his waistcoat .</stage>Who 'd bring me home from the theatre at night then , and from rehearsals ; who ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>Ah , who !<stage>His grip tightening on her .</stage>Who !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Wincing .</stage>Ssss ! You 'll bruise my skin if you 're not careful .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taking her hand and crumpling it in his .</stage>Well , it might be that you 'd miss me for a while — the old dog that you 're accustomed to find lying on your door-mat ;<stage>pressing her hand to his lips</stage>but you do n't love me , Lil — not even as much as you did a year ago . You do n't love me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a faint shrug of her shoulders .</stage>Perhaps I do n't , in the way you mean ;<stage>wistfully</stage>perhaps it 's not in me really to love anybody in a marrying way .<stage>Meeting his eyes .</stage>Still , as you say ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>As I say ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pursing her mouth at him winningly .</stage>I 'm accustomed to you , Nicko .<stage>He draws her to him ; but , with a laugh , she checks him by offering him her head to kiss .</stage>There —<stage>putting the point of her finger playfully on the crown of her head</stage>you may there .<stage>As he kisses her .</stage>Now I must run upstairs , or mother 'll whack me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Detaining her .</stage>Wo n't you allow me to fetch you after the dance ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Three or four in the morning ! No ; I 'll give you a rest . Uncle Lal or Sam 'll take on your job .<stage>Going to the door .</stage>And do n't try to see me to-morrow .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sharply .</stage>Why not ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Not till you turn up at night as usual . I shall be a shocking rag all day .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Breaking out .</stage>Yes , I expect you 'll manage to enjoy yourself thoroughly , and dance yourself off your feet , whoever your partners may be !</p>

    <stage>She departs , leaving him standing near the tea-table . He takes out his handkerchief and mops his brow . As he does so , his eyes rest upon the telephone-instrument on the writing-table and he stares at it . He hesitates , as if struggling to resist an impulse ; then he goes quickly to the instrument and puts the receiver to his ear .</stage>

    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>The scene is an artistically decorated refreshment-saloon — or “ foyer ” — on the first-circle floor of a theatre . The wall facing the spectator is panelled partly in glass , and through the glazed panels the corridor behind the circle , and the doors admitting to the circle , are seen . The right-hand wall is panelled in a similar way , showing the landing at the top of the principal staircase and an entrance to the corridor . Some music-stands and stools are on the landing , arranged for a small orchestra .</stage>
     <stage>In the right-hand wall there is a double swing-door giving on to the landing ; and in the wall at the back , opening on to , and from , the corridor , there is a single swing-door on the left and another on the right . The left-hand door is fastened back into the saloon by a hook . Between the two doors in the back wall runs the refreshment-counter .</stage>
     <stage>In one of the further corners of the saloon there is a plaster statue representing the Muse of Comedy , in the opposite corner a companion figure of Dancing . In the wall on the left , the grate hidden by flowers , is a fireplace with a fender-stool before it , and on either side of the fireplace there is a capacious and richly upholstered arm-chair . A settee of like design stands against the wall on the right between the double-door and the spectator .</stage>
     <stage>The counter is decked-out as a sideboard , and at equal distances from each other there are four round tables laid for a supper-party of twenty-six persons . There are eight chairs at one table and six at each of the others , the chairs being of the sort usually supplied by ball-caterers .</stage>
     <stage>The saloon and the landing without are brilliantly lighted , the corridor less brightly .</stage>
     <stage>[ LUIGI and four waiters — one of whom has a curly head and a fair beard ending in two flamboyant points — are putting the finishing touches to the laying of the tables , while MORRIS COOLING , a person of imposing presence displaying a vast expanse of shirt-front , is engaged in placing upon each of the serviettes a card bearing the name of a guest .</stage>

     <p>“ — you both led me to suppose that this rotten banquet was to be a family gathering of the ladies and gentlemen of the Pandora Theatre , and no outsiders asked . Now I find that only three or four of the men of the Company are invited , and I hear from Nita Trevenna , who has got it from young Kennedy , that several of the Boys are to be laid on for the occasion . The result is you have made me tell a regular whopper to a particular friend of mine with regard to this affair —— ”</p>

They are charmingly dressed , as are all the ladies of the Pandora Theatre . GLYNN and PALK — the latter a short , thick-set man who might reasonably be a low comedian — are two professional-looking gentlemen of the best class . The arrivals are warmly hailed by FULKERSON , VON RETTENMAYER , HENEAGE , and GRIMWOOD and , with more reserve , by MRS. STIDULPH . STIDULPH has seated himself wearily in the armchair on the nearer side of the fireplace and , beyond listening to BLAND who is talking to him , has withdrawn himself from the proceedings .</stage>

    <stage>COOLING returns , entering from the landing , and , after looking at the assembly , goes out at the right-hand door at the back . At the same moment , FLO CONNIFY , SYBIL DERMOTT , OLGA COOK , and EVANGELINE VENTRIS — four statuesque beauties with impassive faces — enter at the door on the left . OLGA is in a dark gown and EVANGELINE is wearing a rather elaborate head-dress . Instantly there is a movement in the direction of the new arrivals on the part of ROPER , HENEAGE , and GRIMWOOD . DE CASTRO and FULKERSON follow , FULKERSON still leading FARNCOMBE about with him . MRS. STIDULPH turns from ENID disdainfully and joins NITA and DAPHNE at the fireplace . TAVISH and SHIRLEY also move to the left , where they come upon STIDULPH and shake hands with him , while VON RETTENMAYER and ENID , the latter flushed with victory , seat themselves upon the settee on the right .</stage>

    <stage>The curtain falls , but the music of “ Mind the Paint ” continues for a while . Then it ceases and , after a short silence , the curtain rises again . The supper-tables have disappeared and the saloon is empty of people . The musicians and their music-stands and stools have also gone , and faintly from the distance comes the sound of a waltz . Two settees , matching the rest of the furniture , now stand in the centre of the saloon back-to-back , one of them facing the counter , the other facing the spectator . LILY 'S bouquet lies on the nearer of the two settees , and upon the floor there is a fan , a red rose that has fallen from a lady 's corsage , and a pocket-handkerchief with a powder-puff peeping from it . On the counter there are carafes of lemonade , decanters of spirits and syphons of soda-water , a bowl of strawberries-and-cream , various dishes of cakes , boxes of cigars and cigarettes , a lighted spirit-lamp , and other adjuncts of a buffet . COLONEL STIDULPH wanders in through the double-door as the waltz comes to an end . Feebly and dejectedly he goes to the counter , takes a cigarette , and is lighting it when LUIGI and the waiters enter the door on the left . Two of the waiters are carrying bottles of champagne in wine-coolers , another brings a tray on which are champagne-glasses and tumblers , and the bearded waiter follows with a large dish of sandwiches .</stage>

     <speaker>LUIGI</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Behind the counter — to STIDULPH , familiarly .</stage>
      <l>Ai n't you dancing ,</l>
      <l>Colonel ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STIDULPH</speaker>
     <p>Dancing — I ?<stage>Shaking his head .</stage>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LUIGI</speaker>
     <p><stage>Who speaks Cockney English with a slight foreign ascent — cutting the wire of a champagne bottle .</stage>Why , you used to be a regular slap-up dancing man when I first knew you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STIDULPH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Nodding .</stage>Ah , ah ;<stage>moving away</stage>my dancing days are done .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LUIGI</speaker>
     <p>Done ! Oh , I like that ! I bet you ai n't sixty , come now , eh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STIDULPH</speaker>
     <p>What 's the time , Luigi ? I have n't a watch on .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LUIGI</speaker>
     <p>Time , Colonel ?<stage>Looking at his watch .</stage>Twenty to three .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STIDULPH</speaker>
     <p>No later ?<stage>Sitting on the settee on the right , with a sigh .</stage>Oh , dear !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>One of the waiters goes out , in obedience to a direction from LUIGI , at the door on the left as HENEAGE enters with ENID , GRIMWOOD with NITA , and VON RETTENMAYER with MRS. STIDULPH at the right-hand door at the back . A wisp of hair has fallen over HENEAGE 'S forehead , GRIMWOOD looks somewhat downcast , and VON RETTENMAYER is obviously bored by MRS. STIDULPH .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ENID</speaker>
     <p><stage>To HENEAGE , walking across to the left .</stage>Never been to Ostend ! You 've never been born , then . I 'm counting the hours to my holiday .<stage>Sitting in the chair on the nearer side of the fireplace .</stage>Hôtel de la Plage . Why do n't you run over while I 'm there ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NITA</speaker>
     <p><stage>To GRIMWOOD , following ENID .</stage>My dear boy , I give you my solemn word it was n't you . It was that fool Bertie . Anyhow , it 's a rotten old frock .<stage>Showing a small rent in her skirt to ENID , gaily .</stage>Pom , pa-ra , rom , pom , pom !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>HENEAGE and GRIMWOOD go to the counter , secure a waiter , and return with him to ENID and NITA . The waiter receives his orders and presently fetches the ladies glasses of lemonade .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. STIDULPH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Whispering to VON RETTENMAYER .</stage>Well ! Did you ever ! Just fancy !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VON RETTENMAYER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Absently , looking at ENID .</stage>I beg your bardon ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. STIDULPH</speaker>
     <p>Fancy those two girls walking into a room before us !<stage>Discovering the fan upon the floor .</stage>Oh , I do believe that 's my fan !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>VON RETTENMAYER restores the fan to MRS. STIDULPH as ROPER and GABRIELLE enter at the door on the left .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GABRIELLE</speaker>
     <p><stage>To ROPER , in a low , complaining voice .</stage>It 's a shame of you ; that 's what it is . You went and put Lily Parradell into rubber and enabled her to make a bit . She told us so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p>Yes ; but how long ago ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GABRIELLE</speaker>
     <p>That 's not the point . The point is , it 's always Lily Parradell with you ; you never do anything for us other girls .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She sits upon the nearer settee in the centre and she and ROPER , he standing by her , continue their conversation .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. STIDULPH</speaker>
     <p><stage>To VON RETTENMAYER .</stage>No , thanks ; I 'm on a diet . Did n't you notice me at supper ?<stage>Moving to the settee on the right .</stage>Let 's sit .<stage>To STIDULPH .</stage>Oh , get up .<stage>STIDULPH rises quickly .</stage>Why are n't you dancing ? If you do n't dance , go home and put yourself to bed . You might , for all the good you 're doing here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STIDULPH</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a forced , painful laugh .</stage>Ha , ha ! Ha , ha , ha !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VON RETTENMAYER</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>As MRS. STIDULPH seats herself .</stage>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STIDULPH</speaker>
     <p>No , no ; I wo n't inconvenience you .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He moves away and VON RETTENMAYER sits beside MRS. STIDULPH . The waiter who has previously gone out now returns at the door on the left with a tray of ices in paper cases . He goes to the counter for a supply of ice-spoons as FARNCOMBE enters with LILY at the right-hand door at the back . Her cheeks are flushed , her eyes sparkling .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>All his attention suddenly directed to LILY and FARNCOMBE .</stage>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Excitedly , seizing STIDULPH 'S hand .</stage>You 're not dancing , Colonel Stidulph .<stage>Showing him her programme .</stage>Dance with me . I 'll make one of the others give up a dance for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STIDULPH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Going to the counter .</stage>No , no ; I 'm too old .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Too old for dancing ! I shall never be too old for dancing .<stage>Coming to the nearer settee in the centre , picking up her bouquet , and sitting beside GABRIELLE .</stage>Ah-h-h-h !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROPER</speaker>
     <p><stage>To FARNCOMBE , who follows LILY .</stage>Hul-lo !<stage>Beaming .</stage>Jolly party , hey , Farncombe ?</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking up at him .</stage>You may keep on bringing me ices till the music starts again .<stage>FARNCOMBE leaves her .</stage>Gabby , was n't that waltz delicious !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PALK and SYBIL enter at the door on the left . SYBIL seats herself beside NITA on the fender-stool and PALK fetches her some refreshment .</stage>
    <sp>

    <stage>GLYNN and OLGA and DE CASTRO and EVANGELINE have entered at the right-hand door at the back . OLGA and EVANGELINE seat themselves upon the further settee in the centre and GLYNN and DE CASTRO summon a waiter to attend upon them . SHIRLEY and FLO now enter at the door on the left and go to the counter . At the same moment SMYTHE , COOLING , and TAVISH enter at the right-hand door at the back , SMYTHE smoking a huge cigar . They also stand at the counter and are served with drinks by LUIGI . LILY and GABRIELLE having each taken an ice , the waiter with the ices moves away and offers his ices to the other ladies . Another waiter carries round a tray on which are a box of cigarettes and the spirit-lamp , and the bearded waiter moves about with the dish of sandwiches . Some of the ladies light cigarettes , a few of the men take sandwiches .</stage>

    <stage>FARNCOMBE is bending over LILY while she is eating her ice and they are talking lightly but intently . GABRIELLE , finding that she is “ out of it , ” rises with a pout and , carrying her plate , joins the ladies and men who are at the fireplace . BLAND enters with JIMMIE at the door on the left .</stage>

     <speaker>MRS. STIDULPH</speaker>

All the couples have now disappeared except VON RETTENMAYER and ENID and FARNCOMBE and LILY .

    <stage>ENID and VON RETTENMAYER disappear . STIDULPH lights his cigarette and is leaving the counter when GABRIELLE and DE CASTRO enter at the right-hand door at the back , DE CASTRO looking exceedingly sulky .</stage>

    <sp>
     <speaker>DE CASTRO</speaker>
     <p><stage>Uncomfortably , patting her shoulder .</stage>Po ’ little girl ; po ’ little girl !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>GABRIELLE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Her melancholy increasing .</stage>Sometimes I 've an idea that if I had a motor-car of my own I should feel easier and happier .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GABRIELLE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Shaking her head .</stage>That 's not the same thing . Whenever I have yours out , I 'm weighed down by a sense of borrowing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DE CASTRO</speaker>
     <p>Well , if I gave you a new car , you 'd be weighed down by a thenthe of my havin ’ paid for it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GABRIELLE</speaker>
     <p>At first I should , but not for long . Seeing my family crest on the door-panels , instead of your monogram , ‘ ud help me to forget you 'd had anything to do with it .<stage>Gloomily .</stage>Of course , it ‘ ud only be an experiment . It might cheer me up , or it might n't .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The music ceases . A waiter carrying a tray enters at the door on the left , goes behind the counter , and mixes some drinks .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DE CASTRO</speaker>
     <p><stage>After a pause , loosening his collar — in a low voice .</stage>Here ! We 'd better dithcuth thith experiment .<stage>Glancing over his shoulder at the waiter .</stage>Let'th come and thit in the pit .</p>

    </sp>
    <stage>They go out on to the landing and disappear as FULKERSON hurries in at the right-hand door at the back . His eyes are rather glassy and his utterance is a little thick .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FULKERSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>To the waiter , joining him behind the counter .</stage>Hi ! Wake up , there !

He swallows his drink greedily , singing to himself between the gulps .</stage>“ Oh , the gals ! Oh , the gals ! I am awfully fond of the gals !<stage>Putting his empty glass upon the counter and making for the door on the left .</stage>Be they ebon or blond , Of the gals I am fond ; I am dreadfully fond of the gals ! ”</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He vanishes as FARNCOMBE and LILY enter at the right-hand door at the back . There is an air of constraint and uneasiness about the girl . She comes to the nearer settee in the centre and again picks up her bouquet . FARNCOMBE follows her . They talk in subdued voices and with frequent pauses .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>Another ice ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>

     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p><stage>After a pause .</stage>I — I wish I had given you a bouquet instead of a big , ugly basket .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>You — you might have brought it to the theatre , as you have that one , and carried it about with you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coldly .</stage>I did n't bring this to the theatre .</p>

     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>No ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>I found it with a lot of other flowers at the stage-door . It 's from the gallery boys —<stage>looking at him for a moment steadily</stage>— and I attach some value to it .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The bearded waiter enters at the right-hand door at the back , takes a box of cigars from the counter , and goes out at the door on the left . LILY walks away from FARNCOMBE and seats herself upon the further settee in the centre .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p><stage>After the waiter has withdrawn , producing his programme .</stage>Number Nine . “ Two Step . Mind the Paint . ”<stage>To LILY .</stage>Of course , you — you are engaged for this ?</p>

     <speaker>LILY</speaker>

     <p>No , I — I kept it open , in case — in case ——</p>

     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>I wonder whether Mr. Cooling would let you off .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>I should n't dream of asking him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>No , but — may I ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>

    </sp>
    <stage>There is a further pause and then she turns to him .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Why I spoke so — so sharply to you — was ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>You did n't speak sharply to me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Was because I 've been very nasty with Morrie — wrote him a furious letter — and I want to make it up to him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>Ah , yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>I called him a pig , and other things ; I hate myself for it .</p>

     <p>A pig ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>Still , that 's no reason why I should be nasty with you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laughingly .</stage>And call me a pig .</p>

     <p>No !</p>

     <p>Not in the least ;<stage>in a frigid tone</stage>only I am in the habit of relying on old friends for those little services .</p>

    <stage>STIDULPH enters from the landing and again wanders to the counter and to the cigarettes . The “ Mind the Paint ” air , to the time of a Two Step , is played in the distance .</stage>

    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I deserve the rebuke .</p>

     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>No , you do n't .<stage>Gently .</stage>You may leave me at my door , with the others , if it will give you any satisfaction .</p>

     <p>Try to . Not now — another time ; when this music is n't exciting you , nor these pretty women . Think it out by yourself ! You 're at the beginning of your career , my boy . Remember me — the old fool who 's brought his to a miserable end — and that I cautioned you — cautioned you —!</p>

    <stage>LUIGI hurries in at the door on the left , followed by a waiter carrying a tray , and by the waiter with the beard .</stage>

    <stage>LUIGI is following the waiter who has carried out the tray when the bearded waiter , coming to the nearer settee in the centre , calls to him .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE BEARDED WAITER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sitting upon the settee , gruffly .</stage>Luigi .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>Probably .<stage>Nodding .</stage>Good-night . Good morning .<stage>He slouches away to the door on the left and there stops , listening . There is the sound of people approaching , singing uproariously and shouting and laughing .</stage>Hullo !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LUIGI</speaker>
     <p><stage>At his elbow .</stage>Ho , ho , ho , ho !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>LUIGI goes out into the corridor and JEYES retreats behind the counter . The noise increases and presently FULKERSON rushes in , flourishing his arms madly . He is followed by GLYNN and SHIRLEY who are carrying LILY upon their interlocked hands , and by PALK who is helping to support her . Then come HENEAGE and NITA , GRIMWOOD and DAPHNE , TAVISH and FLO , VON RETTENMAYER and ENID , DE CASTRO and GABRIELLE , ROPER and MRS. STIDULPH , FARNCOMBE and JIMMIE , BLAND and EVANGELINE , COOLING and SYBIL , and SMYTHE and OLGA . Singing the chorus of the “ Mind the Paint ” song , and dancing to it wildly , they circle the saloon twice , go out at the right-hand door at the back , return at the door on the left , and finally disappear through the double-door and along the landing . The waiters , who have brought up the rear of the procession , gather , with LUIGI , in the left-hand corner , clapping their hands , and STIDULPH returns , entering at the right-hand door at the back .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>

     <speaker>LILY</speaker>

   <div type="act" n="3">
    <head type="act">THE THIRD ACT</head>
    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>The scene is LILY 'S boudoir — a room upon the second floor of her house , adjoining her bedroom . The decorations , though delicate , are gay , with a good deal of pink in them .</stage>
     <stage>In the wall facing the spectator are two doors , one on the left , the other in the centre . The left-hand door opens into the room from the landing , where the staircase is shown ; the centre door admits to the bedroom . In the right-hand wall there are two sash-windows giving a view of the tops of trees growing in a square ; in the opposite wall , the grate hidden by a low , painted screen , is the fireplace .</stage>
     <stage>A prettily designed “ fitment ” runs along the left-hand wall and the further wall , taking in the fireplace and doors as part of its scheme . On either side of the fireplace there is a cupboard with drawers beneath it ; between the door on the left and the door in the centre is a similar cupboard ; and on the right of the centre door , extending to the right-hand wall , there is a wardrobe with sliding doors . The cupboard doors are glazed and curtained in pink silk .</stage>
     <stage>In the middle of the room , a little to the right , there is a large and comfortable settee , and on the left of the settee is a table littered with books , magazines , a scent-atomizer , a small silver-framed mirror , a case of manicure instruments , a box of cigarettes and a match-stand , and other odds and ends . Behind the table there is a fauteuil-stool , and on the right of the table a cosy arm-chair . A second arm-chair stands apart , between the table in the centre and the fireplace .</stage>
     <stage>On the extreme left of the room , on the nearer side of the fireplace , there is a box-ottoman ; on the other side of the room , by the nearer window , are a small writing-table and chair ; standing across the right-hand corner , the key-board towards the further window , are a cottage-piano and a music-stool ; and at the back of the piano there is another small chair , with some soiled gloves upon it .</stage>
     <stage>A quantity of music is heaped untidily on the top of the piano ; one of the wardrobe doors is open , revealing some dresses hanging within ; and the edge of a lace petticoat , with its insertion of coloured ribbon , peeps out from under the carelessly-closed lid of the box-ottoman . Two milliner 's hat-boxes are on the floor by the ottoman , and a pair of satin slippers are lying , one here , one there , under the centre table .</stage>
     <stage>The window-blinds are down but the daylight is seen through them .</stage>
    </stage>
    <stage>The door on the left opens and LILY , still carrying her bouquet , enters and makes straight for the windows and draws up the blinds , letting in the clear , morning light . She is followed by ENID , GABRIELLE , DAPHNE , and JIMMIE and they by FARNCOMBE , VON RETTENMAYER , DE CASTRO , ROPER , FULKERSON , and BLAND . They are all pale and haggard , and slightly dishevelled , but everybody seems broad awake except DAPHNE , who is borne down by sleepiness . Some of the men are smoking .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laying her bouquet upon the table in the centre as she crosses to the windows — to the women .</stage>Come in , dears ;<stage>drawing up the blind of the nearer window</stage>come in , boys . Take off your things for a minute .</p>

    </sp>
    <stage>VON RETTENMAYER and DE CASTRO have placed their overcoats and hats upon the chair at the back of the piano and FARNCOMBE , BLAND , and ROPER have piled theirs on the arm-chair on the left . ENID and GABRIELLE throw their wraps upon the settee , DAPHNE drops hers upon the box-ottoman , and JIMMIE puts hers over the arm of the chair by the centre table .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>To everybody .</stage>I 'll just run upstairs and tell mother that all 's serene .<stage>She goes to the door on the left ; FARNCOMBE , BLAND , and ROPER get in each other 's way in their desire to open it for her .</stage>If any of you want a drink , you must hunt for it yourselves in the dining-room .<stage>To ROPER .</stage>You play host , Uncle Lal .</p>

     <speaker>VON RETTENMAYER</speaker>
     <p><stage>To ENID , bestirring himself .</stage>I beg bardon .<stage>He goes out , with DE CASTRO . ENID has taken the mirror from the table and now looks at herself in it .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ENID</speaker>
     <p>What a sight !<stage>To GABRIELLE .</stage>I wonder whether Lil would mind me going into her bedroom ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GABRIELLE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taking the mirror from ENID .</stage>Of course she would n't .<stage>Viewing herself with dismay .</stage>Oh , I 'm yellower than you !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She jumps up , throwing the mirror upon the settee , and goes to the door in the centre . ENID follows her and the two girls open the door narrowly and withdraw . JIMMIE rises and picks up the mirror .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JIMMIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With one knee upon the settee , surveying herself .</stage>Ugh , you lovely creature !<stage>Glancing at FARNCOMBE as she readjusts a comb , and finding that he is gazing at her earnestly .</stage>Turn your face to the wall , please ; I 'm about to use my puff .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Suddenly , with rapid movements , he shuts the door on the left , gives a quick look at DAPHNE , assures himself that the centre door is closed , and comes to JIMMIE . She stares at him in astonishment .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Standing at the back of the settee — in a low voice .</stage>Miss Birch , you 're Miss Parradell 's friend — her great friend . Will you be a friend of mine too , and do me a service ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>Beg her to allow me to remain behind , with you , for a few minutes after the others have gone .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>I know I should make a bungle of it with all these people round me , and attract attention . You 're clever .</p>

    <stage>She pulls him towards her and whispers into his ear . He nods . She whispers again , breathlessly , and then releases him .</stage>

    <stage>The refrain is repeated , the dancers droning to it with a , buzzing sound , and then BLAND returns to the melody .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>As she dances , recollecting the note she is holding and opening it .</stage>What 's this ?<stage>Reading the note , her arm resting upon FARNCOMBE 'S shoulder .</stage>“ Dear Miss Parradell ....<stage>glancing at the signature</stage>Farncombe ” !<stage>To FARNCOMBE .</stage>From you !</p>

    <stage>He waves to FARNCOMBE gaily and departs , closing the door . There is a short silence and then FARNCOMBE places his hat and overcoat upon the chair by the piano and turns to LILY .</stage>

    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>It 's true . Life 'll be over for me from that moment , if you refuse to marry me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Mockingly .</stage>Over !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , love is all on my side at present , naturally ; but , as God hears me , it 'll be no fault of mine if you do n't grow to love me in time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Listen ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>I 'll worship you — worship you . I do worship you !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>H'sh ! Lord Farncombe ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>Eddie ! Wo n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Certainly not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>Do ! Eddie ! Eddie !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Eddie , then ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>Ah ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Sit down a minute .<stage>She goes to the settee and sits there , somewhat ruffled , and he moves to the arm-chair by the centre table and also sits , his elbows on his knees , bending towards her . She pushes her hair back from her brow impatiently , as if vexed with herself .</stage>Lord Farncombe — Eddie — for how long have you known me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>What does it matter ? I — I admit ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Reckoning our acquaintance from last week — from the afternoon Bertie brought you here , when we scarcely spoke to one another — you have n't known me for as many days as you can count on your fingers .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>I 've watched you — watched you in the theatre ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>On the stage ! Ho , ho ! Oh , you — but I must n't call you silly boy again , must I ! And what do you know of me , apart from the glimpse you 've had of me off the stage , and my being a shining light at the Pandora ? What do you know of my — what 's the word ?— origin — where and what I 've sprung from ; how I was reared ; how much education I 've received ; how much I 've contrived to pick up of the way to behave in perlite society ? You can judge from poor mother , if from nothing else , that I come from humble beginnings . Yes , but how humble you could n't dream ,<stage>making a grimace</stage>not after a supper of raw carrots !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>Do you think I care how humble your beginnings were ! What I do know — what I am sure about — is that you 're good — and beautiful — and — and — and gifted — and — and —<stage>leaning his head on his hands</stage>oh , I can n't describe you ; you 're — you 're — to me , you 're perfect .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>After a pause , looking at him with blinking eyelids .</stage>You — you dear !<stage>He raises his head . She changes her tone instantly .</stage>Merci ; yes , perfect , pour le moment . Hear my French !<stage>Taking the box of cigarettes from the table .</stage>Have a cigarette ? Do n't get up .<stage>She tosses him a cigarette and he catches it .</stage>My name 's printed on them — “ Lily . ”<stage>Lighting a cigarette .</stage>Is n't it chic !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Producing his cigarette case and exchanging her cigarette for one of his own .</stage>I 'll never smoke that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pushing the match-stand towards him .</stage>Stoopid ! Now , attend to me . What do you say to a tiny provision shop in Kennington , over the water ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>Was that ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Nodding .</stage>H 'm ; that was my start in the world . Father kept a small shop in Kennington — Gladwin Street , near the Oval . We sold groceries , and butter and eggs and cheese , and pickled-pork and paraffin . I was born there — on the second floor ; and in Gladwin Street I lived till I was fourteen . Then father smashed , through the Stores cutting into our little trade . Well , hardly smashed ; that 's too imposing . The business just faded , and one morning we did n't bother to take the shutters down . Then , after a while , father got a starvation berth — eighteen shillings a week !— at a wholesale bacon warehouse — Price and Moseley 's — still over the water ; and I earned an extra five at a place in the Westminster Bridge Road , for pasting the gilt edges on to passe-partouts from nine a. m. till six in the evening .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p><stage>His head bowed again .</stage>Great heavens !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Not a syllable against the passe-partouts ! They were the making of me . It was the passe-partouts that brought me and Tedder together .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>Who ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Tedder . In the house where I worked , a man of the name of Tedder — Ambrose Tedder — taught dancing — stage dancing — “ Tedder 's Academy of Saltatory Art ” — and every time I passed Tedder 's door , and heard his violin or piano , and the sound of the pupils ’ feet , I —!<stage>Breaking off and throwing herself back .</stage>Oh , lor ’ , if once I ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>Go on ; go on .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Well , ultimately Tedder took me and trained me — did it for nix — for what he hoped to get out of me in the future . Ah , and he has n't lost over me — poor old Ambrose ! He collared a third of my salary for ever so long ; and now that the old chap 's rheumaticky and worn out , I — oh , it 's not worth mentioning .<stage>Jumping up and walking away .</stage>My stars , he could teach , could Tedder ! I began by going to him for the last twenty minutes of my dinner-hour . He wanted to stop that , because it was bad for me , he said , to practise on a full — a full —! Ha , ha , ha ! On a full —!<stage>Behind the table , resting her two hands upon it and shaking with laughter .</stage>Ho , ho , ho ! As if I ever had — in those days ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Writhing .</stage>Ah , do n't — do n't ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Brushing the tears from her eyes .</stage>I was a pupil of Tedder 's for twelve months , and then he got me on at the Canterbury ; and from the Canterbury I went to Gatti 's , and from Gatti 's to the Lane , for a few lines in the pantomime and an understudy — my first appearance in the West End —<stage>singing</stage>“ Oh , the West End is the best end ! ” — and from there I went to the old Strand , and there Morrie Cooling spotted me , and that led to me being engaged at the Pandora , where I ate my heart out , doing next to nothing , for two whole years . Then came the production of The Duchess of Brixton , and it was in The Duchess — thanks to Vincent Bland — that I sang the “ Mind the Paint ” song . He believed in me , did Vincent ; he saw I was fit for something more than just prancing about , and airing my ankles , in a gay frock . By Jupiter , how he fought for me ; how he fought for me , up to the final rehearsal ! And to this day , whenever I indulge in a prayer , you bet Vincent Bland has a paragraph all to himself in it !<stage>Checking herself and coming to FARNCOMBE .</stage>Oh , but — I need n't inflict quite so much of my biography on you , need I ?<stage>He rises .</stage>Sorry . I merely wanted to tell you enough to show you — to show you ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Close to her , gazing into her eyes .</stage>To show me what a — what a marvel you are !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pleased .</stage>Ha , ha ! Oh , I 'm not chucking mud at myself really . Why should I ! Many a woman ‘ ud feel as vain as a peacock in my shoes . Fancy ! From the shop in Gladwin Street to —<stage>with a gesture</stage>to this ! And from Tedder 's stuffy room in the Westminster Bridge Road to the stage of the Pandora , as principal girl !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Tenderly .</stage>Wonderful !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Carried away by her narration and putting her hands upon his shoulders familiarly .</stage>Yes , and all the schooling I 've ever had , Eddie , was at a cheap , frowsy day-school in Kennington , with a tribe of other common , skinny-legged brats . Imagine it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taking her hands .</stage>I can n't imagine it ; I defy anybody to .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Unthinkingly allowing him to retain her hands .</stage>Everything I 've learned since — except my music , and that I owe to Tedder and Vincent — everything I 've learned since , I 've learned by sheer cuteness , from novels , the papers , the theatres , and by keeping my ears open like a cunning little parrot .<stage>Softly .</stage>Ha , ha ! That 's what I am — a cunning little parrot !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laughing with her .</stage>Ha , ha !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Tossing her head .</stage>Ho , I dare say , if I had the opportunity , I could imitate the fine lydies you mix with , so that in less than six months you 'd hardly know the difference between them and me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Holding her hands to his breast .</stage>There is no difference already ; there is none .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Is n't there !<stage>Almost nestling up to him .</stage>Ah , you should see me in one of my vile tempers .<stage>Wistfully .</stage>Then — then you would n't —!<stage>Becoming conscious of her proximity to him , she backs away and stands rubbing the palms of her hands together in embarrassment .</stage>Anyhow — anyhow it is n't my intention to give you a chance of comparing us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Under his breath .</stage>Oh — Miss Parradell ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Collecting herself .</stage>No , I — I 'm not going to let you make a fool of yourself over me , if I can help it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>Fool ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Facing him and speaking quietly but firmly .</stage>Recollect , however shrewd and apt I may be , and however straight I 've managed to keep myself , still — I 'm only a Pandora girl , and should always be remembered as one by your chums and belongings . Only a Pandora girl . Nothing can alter that , dear boy ; and you must n't — you must n't handicap yourself by hanging me round your neck .</p>

      <stage>Heavily .</stage>
      <l>I — I should n't be the first of my sort to marry a</l>
      <l>“ Pandora girl , ” not by half a dozen or more .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>No , but — without wishing to flatter you — I do n't quite put you on a level with Robbie Kinterton , and Glenroy , and Georgie Fawcus , and — that crew .<stage>Cheerfully .</stage>And so I mean to take care of you — to take care of you for your own sake and for your mammy 's and daddy 's .<stage>She turns from him and fetches his hat and coat and gives them to him . He receives them from her with a dazed look .</stage>Time 's up .<stage>After a silence during which neither stirs .</stage>Never mind . You 'll survive it .<stage>Another pause .</stage>Come along .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She passes him , to go to the door on the left . As she does so he flings his hat and coat on to the settee , and clasps her in his arms .</stage>

     <p><stage>In a whisper , averting her head .</stage>N-no — we 'd better not ——<stage>There is a low but distinct knocking at the door on the left .

The knocking is repeated .</stage>Mother .<stage>She goes to the door and speaks with her mouth close to it .</stage>That you , mother ?<stage>She listens for a reply and again the knocking is heard .</stage>Who is it ?<stage>She opens the door . JEYES is outside .</stage>Nicko !<stage>JEYES comes into the room . He has rid himself of his wig and beard and is wearing an overcoat buttoned up to his chin and a cap drawn down to his brows . His face is white and his jaws are set determinedly .</stage>How — how have you got in ?<stage>He produces a bunch of keys and grimly displays a latch-key .</stage>Oh — oh ——!<stage>Pulling off his cap , JEYES advances to the table in the centre , glaring at FARNCOMBE . LILY closes the door sharply and also advances , speaking volubly to FARNCOMBE as she comes forward .</stage>Captain Jeyes is in the habit of bringing me home from the theatre after my work ; and a long while ago I gave him a latch-key to carry on his key-ring , so that he could let me into my house whenever I 'd forgotten my own key . He has n't the slightest right to use it at any other time ; nobody knows that better than he does . It 's a confounded liberty !<stage>To JEYES , hotly .</stage>What are you doing here at all at this hour of the morning ?</p>

     <p>Eddie ! Eddie !</p>

     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Turning upon JEYES in a fury .</stage>Yes , you cad — Eddie , Eddie , EDDIE ! You cad ! You sneak ! You idler ! You waster ! I 've stood it long enough . This is the last straw ! I 've done with you ! I 'm sick to death of you ! How I 've tolerated you all these years is a mystery to me ! After this , get out of my sight and never show yourself to me again !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Grasping her wrist , fiercely .</stage>Lily ——!</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Wrenching herself free .</stage>What !<stage>Losing control over herself utterly .</stage>You 'll spy on me , will you , you shabby loafer ! You 'll peep at me while I 'm eating my supper , and count the dances I choose to give that boy over there , will you ! And then you 'll break into my house , and insult my friends behind their backs , and insinuate foul things against my poor old mother — you damned coward !— and against me ,<stage>pointing to FARNCOMBE</stage>and him ! Why , you 're not fit to black his boots , and you never were — never — you — you — you scum ! Here !<stage>Taking FARNCOMBE 'S note from her bosom and thrusting it at JEYES .</stage>Read that !<stage>Sitting in the arm-chair by the centre table .</stage>Read it ! Read it ! Read it !<stage>JEYES reads to himself .</stage>Out loud !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Mumbling .</stage>“ Dear Miss Parradell . Will you allow me ——? ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Louder !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>“ Will you allow me to remain behind for a few minutes with Miss Jimmie after the others have gone ? I know I am presuming a lot , but I cannot leave you till I have asked you the most important question a man can put to a woman . Farncombe . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Breathless .</stage>Written here — on my note-paper — while I was out of the room ! It came on me like a thunder-clap ! Ah ! Ah ! Ah !<stage>JEYES sits upon the settee , staring at the carpet .</stage>And Morrie Cooling and Lal will tell you that I had n't a notion that Lord Farncombe was to be at the supper last night , or any of the boys ; not a notion . I blackguarded ‘ em both for deceiving me , and causing me to deceive you .<stage>Taking the scent-atomizer from the table and spraying her face with it .</stage>Now ! What have you to say now ! Ah ! Ah ! Ah !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Huskily .</stage>Why — why the devil did you let Jimmie go ? Why did you let her go ? It was knowing that you and Farncombe were alone that — that made me ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , if I 'd suspected that a private detective was hovering around , I 'd have kept the whole lot of my friends ! As it was , Jimmie was looking dead , and —!<stage>in disdain .</stage>Pah !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>There is a pause and then JEYES sits upright and draws his hand wearily across his eyes .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>To LILY .</stage>Well , I — I beg your pardon .<stage>LILY continues to spray herself energetically .</stage>I 'm not so completely scum as not to see that I ought to beg your pardon .<stage>Humbly .</stage>I beg your pardon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Softening by degrees .</stage>You — you drive me mad sometimes — positively frantic !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Partly to himself .</stage>
      <l>Mad !</l>
      <stage>To FARNCOMBE .</stage>
      <l>And you , Farncombe —</l>
      <l>I hope you 'll accept my apologies . I offer them unreservedly .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <stage>FARNCOMBE bows , somewhat stiffly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>To JEYES , protruding her lower lip .</stage>I — I did n't mean half I said , Nicko ; I did n't mean half of it .<stage>Eyeing FARNCOMBE askance as she replaces the atomizer .</stage>And I — I 'm ashamed of myself for losing my self-control as I did .<stage>There is another pause and then JEYES gets to his feet and silently returns the note to LILY . She looks up at him piteously and puts the note back into her bosom . Then he takes out his key-ring , removes the latch key from it , and throws the key on to the table . Having done this , he drags his cap from his pocket and makes for the door on the left . As he passes LILY , she rises and gently plucks at his sleeve .</stage>Nicko — Nicko ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a thick voice .</stage>Eh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Wo n't you — wo n't you give Lord Farncombe — some explanation ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>Explanation ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Of the sort of terms we 've been on , you and I , He — he must be — rather puzzled —<stage>turning away to the table .</stage>Oh , it 's due to you as well as to me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Dully .</stage>Just as you please .<stage>With a hard laugh .</stage>Ho , ho ! Yes , perhaps it is due to me that he should learn a little more about me than he 's been able to gather from personal observation — and from your eloquent but summary description .<stage>Under his breath , screwing up his cap .</stage>Idler — waster — loafer ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Penitently .</stage>Nicko !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>To FARNCOMBE , quietly .</stage>Oh , it 's a true bill , Farncombe . And yet , a very few years back — she wo n't dispute it — I was one of the smartest chaps going , good at my job , with prospects as rosy as any man 's in my regiment . There was n't a cloud the size of your hand , apparently , in my particular bit of sky at the time I speak of ; not a speck ! Then I met this young lady , and —<stage>pointing to the box-ottoman</stage>well , since we 're in for it ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Captain Jeyes ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>No , no ; she wishes you to understand the exact nature of the friendship between her and me . I 'm obeying instructions .<stage>FARNCOMBE sits on the ottoman , nursing his hat and overcoat . Then JEYES sits in the arm-chair by the centre table , first turning the chair so that it faces FARNCOMBE .</stage>Farncombe , I was under thirty , and still a subaltern , when I made Miss Parradell 's acquaintance . Like most of my pals , I was spending my nights , whenever I could get away from Aldershot , in the stalls at the Pandora — much the same as you 've been doing recently , and as a certain class of young man 'll go on doing as long as the Pandora , and similar shops , continue to flourish . Ha ! How honoured we felt , we men , in those days , at knowing some of the Pandora girls , and having the privilege of supping ‘ em and standing ‘ em dinner on Sunday evenings ! If they 'd been royal princesses we could n't have been more elated .<stage>With a gesture .</stage>Do n't jump at conclusions . It generally ended there , or with our running into debt at a jeweller 's . We were young , they were beautiful — or we thought ‘ em so ; but the majority of us were n't vicious , any more than the majority of the girls were — though many of ‘ em were mighty calculating . It would have been better for us men if all the girls had been wicked ; the glamour , the infatuation , the folly , would have been sooner over , and one of us at least would have had a different tale to tell .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>JEYES pauses , gazing at the floor , FARNCOMBE moves impatiently on the ottoman and LILY seats herself upon the settee .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Plaintively .</stage>Nicko — Nicko — I merely wanted you to ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rousing himself and speaking to LILY over his shoulder .</stage>Who was it introduced us ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Miss Du Cane — Aggie Du Cane .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>Agnes Du Cane . She 's gone under .<stage>To LILY .</stage>Outside Buckley 's oyster-bar , was n't it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Not outside ; in the parlour .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>To FARNCOMBE .</stage>Lily had only lately come to the Pandora — a pale-faced slip of a thing .<stage>To LILY .</stage>Eighteen , were n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Nodding .</stage>Eighteen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>I confess I was n't overwhelmingly attracted by her at first ; she was so unlike the rest .<stage>Laughing bitterly .</stage>Ha , ha , ha !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Weakly .</stage>Ha , ha , ha ! Was n't I dowdy !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>But she was humble , and naïve , and confiding ; and my vanity was tickled by her delight at the little treats I gave her , and by her gratitude for a tuppeny-ha'penny present or two . Nobody , I believe , with any pretensions to being a gentleman , had paid her much attention before I arrived on the scene .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a murmur .</stage>No ; nobody .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>I did n't find out that I was in love with her — you guess it 's a love story , do n't you ?——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Delicately .</stage>My dear Captain Jeyes ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>I did n't find out that I was neck and heels in love with her until nearly a year afterwards , when my regiment went to the Curragh . That did it — separation ! What I suffered in that hole , thinking of her , starving for her ! In less than three months I was in London again , on leave , and in my old stall at the Pandora . But even then , Farncombe , I had n't your pluck .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>Pluck ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>The pluck to snap my fingers at the world and propose marriage to a Pandora girl . Besides , my mother was alive then , and —<stage>abruptly , with a wild look</stage>would you like to know what she used to call these Pandora women , Farncombe ?<stage>Bending forward , his hands tightly clenched .</stage>She used to call them a menace to society . With their beauty , and their flagrant opportunities for displaying it , they are a living curse , she used to say — a source of constant dread to mothers whose hope it is to see their sons safely mated to modest , maidenly girls of the typical English pattern . She told us once — my brothers and me — frightened as to where we were drifting , that she was one of many mothers who prayed on their knees daily that their boys might be spared from being drawn into the net woven by their own weaknesses and passions — drawn into it by these — these ——!<stage>He breaks off , stares about him for a moment , and then rises .</stage>Oh , but I ought n't to have repeated this to you . Pardon .<stage>Walking away unsteadily .</stage>Ho , damned bad taste !<stage>Behind the table , supporting himself by leaning upon it .</stage>Where was I ? Back from the Curragh !<stage>Confused .</stage>Yes — yes — and so things went on for a couple o ’ years — I trailing after Lily closer than ever — and at last — at last I did ask her to be my wife .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Who has been listening to JEYES with parted lips and wide-open eyes — appealingly .</stage>Do n't ! Do n't , Nicko ; do n't !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Oblivious of her interruption .</stage>But I 'd left it too late . The novelty of me had worn off ; she 'd scores of friends by that time ; she 'd made her big hit , and followed it with another , and was the talk o ’ the town . And she 'd money ; she was n't dependent on me any longer for her gloves and her trips and outings !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Her head drooping .</stage>Oh ! Oh !<stage>Wringing her hands .</stage>Oh , that 's beastly of you ; beastly !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>She was kind to me too , in a way — kind and cruel . She did n't want to marry me ; she did n't want to marry anybody ; she was in love with herself , and her success , and what it was bringing her . But she would n't give me the kick . No , she would n't do that ; I had been something to her . And there 's where the kindness came in — and the merciless cruelty .<stage>Sitting upon the fauteuil-stool rigidly .</stage>God , if only she 'd broken with me then , firmly and finally — if only she 'd broken with me then — she — she might have saved me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Struggling with her tears .</stage>Oh , Nicko , Nicko !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>Twelve months ago she did throw me a bone . The regiment was under orders for India , and of course I sent in my papers ; and out of pity , I suppose — and because I was always pestering her — she promised to become engaged to me if I 'd get other work to do . Work ! I wonder whether really she was grinning to herself when she made the stipulation !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Oh — oh ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>Work ! All the spunk , all the energy , had been sapped out of me long before , and even her promise could n't revive it . My search for a berth was n't much more than a sham . At the back of my head I knew very well what I 'd come to . The only work I was capable of was dancing attendance on her , and filling in what remained of the day and night at a rotten restaurant , a Bohemian club , and the bar of the theatre . And that 's been my sole employment for the past year — nothing but that . Pretty , for a man who started life as swimmingly as I did !<stage>His voice dying away .</stage>Pretty — pretty — pretty — pretty ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>After a profound stillness .</stage>I — I do n't think you 've ever — put the case to me — quite so plainly as this , Nicko .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>I — I do n't think I 've ever put it quite so plainly — to myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Her lip trembling .</stage>You — you wo n't believe me ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>What ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I — I 've never fully realised it till now — the harm I 've done you .</l>
      <l>I declare to God I 've never realised it till now .</l>
      <stage>Faintly .</stage>
      <l>Nicko ——!</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>After a further pause .</stage>Ah , well —!<stage>With a deep sigh .</stage>Ah , well !<stage>To FARNCOMBE , resignedly .</stage>Farncombe , I — I 'm afraid I 'm a shocking brute . I — I got carried away . Forget — forget the things I 've said of this girl . Forget ‘ em , will yer ?<stage>Starting to his feet .</stage>And look here ! A man who is n't a sportsman deserves to be shot . You 've won her ; I 've lost her . Congratulate yer , old chap ; congratulate yer !<stage>Pulling on his cap .</stage>Take care of her , that 's all ; m-m-mind you take care of her !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He turns towards the door and she jumps up and runs to him and seizes his arm . FARNCOMBE also rises .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>No , no , Nicko ! Nicko —!<stage>Giving FARNCOMBE a half frightened , half imploring look .</stage>Nicko , I can n't undo the mischief I 've done ; I can n't do that . But I can try to make it up to you — some of it — and I will , if you 'll let me .<stage>Putting her arms round his shoulders .</stage>Nicko ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Roughly .</stage>Make it — up to me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Her face close to his .</stage>You know what I mean ! As soon as possible — next month , if you like — next week — quietly —!<stage>He grips her arms and stares at her blankly .</stage>Ha , ha ! Yes , you 've been in too great a hurry to settle matters , you have . Lord Farncombe and I — we — we 're not going to be married . I 've refused him .<stage>Wildly .</stage>I — I 've ruined you , Nicko ; but I — I 've told him — I 'm not going to draw him into my net !<stage>Clinging to JEYES and burying her face in the breast of his coat , crying .</stage>Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! I 'm not going to draw him into my net !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Again there is a pause and then JEYES turns to FARNCOMBE , dazed .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>Farncombe ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Inclining his head .</stage>Yes — yes ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>With feeling .</stage>My dear fellow , I — I ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Raising her head and speaking through her tears — to JEYES .</stage>Nicko , I — I want to have one more word with Lord Farncombe — just one more word .<stage>He nods understandingly and goes to the door on the left . She follows him .</stage>Only a minute ;<stage>he opens the door</stage>and then you must walk away together , you and he , and part good friends .<stage>He goes out on to the landing and she closes the door and stands with her back to it , drying her eyes with her handkerchief . FARNCOMBE , still carrying his hat and overcoat , has crossed to the settee , a forlorn figure .</stage>W-w-well , you — you have had a lucky escape , have n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Heavily .</stage>Escape ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Leaving the door and advancing .</stage>You — you 've heard what a cold-blooded , selfish wretch I am — how I 've treated Nicko !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Waving the idea away .</stage>Oh ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coming to him .</stage>And you 've seen what I 'm like when I 'm in a rage ; you 've seen what the genuine Lily Margaret Upjohn is , without her disguise .<stage>Looking up into his face pathetically .</stage>Yes , that was me , Eddie , under the crust . Common as dirt , dear ; common as dirt !<stage>Holding the lapels of his coat .</stage>Oh ! Oh , you 'll always remember me , with my eyes starting out of my head , spitting at Nicko ! You 'll always picture that horrible sight when you think of me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>You — you were provoked ; I — I admired you for it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Tenderly .</stage>Ah , you dear boy !<stage>In an altered tone .</stage>Eddie ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>Yes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Had you — a little hope — that , after all , I might turn your offer over in my mind and — and eventually ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>Yes — yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a catch in her breath .</stage>Ah ——!<stage>In a whisper .</stage>I — I 'll tell you something .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>What ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>In his ear .</stage>I might have , if — if you 'd persisted .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Groaning .</stage>Oh-h-h-h !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Retreating a step or two .</stage>Thank God Nicko came along ! Thank God Nicko came along ! What was it his mother called us girls ? A menace to society ; creatures to be dreaded , and prayed against ! You see I was right in wishing to protect you for your mammy 's sake as well as your own . But , oh — thank God Nicko came along !<stage>He sits suddenly upon the settee and covers his face with his hands . She returns to him quickly .</stage>Ah , do n't do that ; do n't do that !<stage>Touching his hands .</stage>Eddie ! Eddie ! I 'm not worth it . Eddie !<stage>With an effort , he lifts his head .</stage>Listen . This is what I want to say to you . Do n't come near me any more ; you must n't . And do n't come to the theatre again either . If I thought you were sitting in front , I — I 'm sure I could n't ——!<stage>Entreatingly .</stage>Swear — swear you 'll keep away from me , and from the theatre !<stage>He nods .</stage>And you 'll never go to any supper or dinner or dance where you 're likely to meet the other girls , will you ? Eddie !<stage>He shakes his head .</stage>Swear !<stage>He rises and , as he does so , she grips the lapels of his coat again , her eyes blazing fiercely .</stage>Oh ! Oh ! If one of the other girls ever got hold of you , I — I —<stage>hissing into his face</stage>I 'd kill her !<stage>She leaves him and goes to the door on the left and opens it .</stage>Nicko !<stage>JEYES enters the room .</stage>March , both of you !<stage>Exhausted .</stage>I — I 'm pretty well baked .<stage>FARNCOMBE joins LILY and JEYES at the door and she stands between the two men looking from one to the other and taking a hand of each .</stage>Ha , ha , ha ! I 've made the pair of you precious miserable , if you only knew it .<stage>To JEYES .</stage>The difference is that he 'll soon forget me , and you , with me for a wife , are doomed for life .<stage>Putting her hands upon JEYES ’ shoulders .</stage>Nicko ——!<stage>She kisses him lightly and , having done so , asks him a question with her eyes . JEYES turns aside and she faces FARNCOMBE and offers him her lips . They kiss .</stage>Good-bye .<stage>After a moment 's pause , to both of them .</stage>Away with you !<stage>The two men go out and she follows them to the top of the stairs and watches them descend . Then she slowly comes back into the room and stands listening at the door . There is a distant sound .</stage>Ah !<stage>Partly closing the door , she wanders about the room aimlessly for a while . Then , impulsively , she runs to the further window , lifts the sash , and looks below .</stage>Ah !... Ah !...<stage>Drawing back .</stage>Ah-h-h-h ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She shuts the window and comes to the settee and , sitting there , takes off her shoes . Then she goes down upon the floor inelegantly , hunts for her slippers , and puts them on . As she rises , the door on the left is pushed open and MRS. UPJOHN peeps in cautiously .</stage>

    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>The scene is the same as in the preceding act , but the light outside is brighter and warmer and in the room is more diffused . On the table in the centre , placed close to the settee , there is a small tray with a breakfast of tea and toast upon it . The bedroom door is partly open .</stage>
     <stage>[ LILY , wan and red-eyed , is lying , propped up by cushions , upon the settee . A newspaper is on her lap but she is gazing at vacancy . She is in négligé . A dainty morning-robe covers her night-gown , her bare feet are in slippers , and her hair is in a simple knot . MAUD is at one of the drawers of the cupboard at the back , engaged in selecting some articles of lingerie , and MRS. UPJOHN , completely dressed for the day , is sitting in the arm-chair by the centre table , her face hidden by a newspaper which she is reading . Presently MAUD shuts the drawer and , carrying the lingerie , comes forward .</stage>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MAUD</speaker>
     <p><stage>To LILY .</stage>What frock 'll you put on ?</p>

     <p><stage>Changing her position .</stage>If only Nicko had been there , I should n't have given young Farncombe all those dances , nor wandered about with him in the intervals , nor allowed him to see me home .

    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>So — so disappointed with myself .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Opening her eyes widely .</stage>Fancy my letting myself go with young Farncombe as I did ! He — he 'd been admiring me from a distance for weeks and weeks , but I 'd scarcely noticed him till last night !<stage>Leaning her head against MRS.

     <speaker>MRS. UPJOHN</speaker>
     <p>Well , you 've got a tough job before you , Lil , in my opinion .</p>

     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps ; but I mean to succeed .<stage>After a pause .</stage>Besides ——</p>

     <p>Besides ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Slowly .</stage>I 've told you — Nicko or no Nicko — I 'm determined — I 'm determined not to draw Eddie Farncombe into my net .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. UPJOHN</speaker>
     <p>Into your net ?<stage>Another pause .</stage>Lil ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Eh ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. UPJOHN</speaker>
     <p>That 's twice you 've made use o ’ that remark . ‘ Oo 's accused you ——?<stage>There is a lively rat-tat at the door on the left .</stage>Come in !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The door opens and JIMMIE BIRCH bounces into the room .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JIMMIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>As she closes the door .</stage>Ah , Ma ! Ah , Lillums !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. UPJOHN</speaker>
     <p>Good mornin ’ .</p>

     <p><stage>Kissing MRS. UPJOHN .</stage>Ha , ha ! We 've met before , this morning , have n't we !<stage>Coming to LILY .</stage>Well , dear old girl , and how are you to-day ?<stage>Kissing LILY and then eyeing her keenly .</stage>A wreck ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Rather .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JIMMIE</speaker>
     <p>I ought to be , but I 'm not . Directly I laid my pretty head on my pillow I went off , and never stirred till I found the breakfast-tray on my chest .<stage>Reckoning on her fingers .</stage>Five to six — six to seven — seven to eight — eight to nine — nine to ten — ten to eleven . I 've had six hours ; that 's not so dusty .<stage>To LILY , slyly .</stage>You did n't sleep very soundly , probably ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Not very .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JIMMIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling from ear to ear .</stage>Excited ?<stage>LILY shrugs her shoulders . There is a silence and then JIMMIE , still beaming , looks round and sees that MRS. UPJOHN has seated herself upon the fauteuil-stool .</stage>May I sit down for a minute ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Of course , Jimmie ; do .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>JIMMIE sits in the arm-chair by the centre table , awaiting some communication which does n't come . MRS. UPJOHN drums upon the table with her fingers and LILY busies herself with re-arranging the cushions on the settee .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JIMMIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>After a while .</stage>Hope I have n't dropped in too early ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Settling her shoulders into the cushions .</stage>Not a bit , dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JIMMIE</speaker>
     <p>It 's nearly half-past twelve . I — I dashed round .<stage>After another pause , unable to restrain herself further .</stage>Any news ? Any-any-anything to tell me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. UPJOHN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Abruptly .</stage>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JIMMIE</speaker>
     <p>W-w-what ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. UPJOHN</speaker>
     <p>Lil 's engaged .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JIMMIE</speaker>
     <p>Hah !<stage>Triumphantly .</stage>Hah , hah !<stage>Clapping her hands and beating her feet upon the floor .</stage>Hah , hah , hah , hah !<stage>Jumping up and sitting beside LILY and hugging and kissing her .</stage>Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Y 'm ! Y 'm ! Y 'm ! Oh , you humbugs !<stage>Rising and rushing at MRS. UPJOHN and embracing her .</stage>You solemn humbug , Ma !<stage>Leaving MRS. UPJOHN and singing and dancing to the refrain sung in the previous Act .</stage>“ If you would only , only love me ;— ” Ha , ha , ha ! “ If you would merely , merely say ,—— ”<stage>Her voice gradually dying away as she sees that the expression on LILY 'S face , and upon MRS. UPJOHN 'S , does n't alter .</stage>“ Wait but a little —<stage>standing still</stage>little — for me —— ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. UPJOHN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Caustically .</stage>Yes , you ‘ ad better wait a little ; you 'd better wait till you ‘ ear ‘ oo she 's engaged to .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JIMMIE</speaker>
     <p>Who — to !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Studying her nails .</stage>Whom to , mother .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JIMMIE</speaker>
     <p>Why , is n't it ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. UPJOHN</speaker>
     <p>No , it ai n't . It 's the Captain .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JIMMIE</speaker>
     <p>T-t-the Cap —!<stage>To LILY .</stage>N-n-nicko ?<stage>LILY nods . JIMMIE draws a deep breath .</stage>Oh-h-h-h !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Calmly .</stage>Nicko turned up here early this morning — while Eddie — while Lord Farncombe was with me , in fact — and I — we — the three of us — we talked matters over , and — and ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JIMMIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Her eyes starting out of her head .</stage>Was there a row ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , do n't be so curious , Jimmie . Poor Nicko has been after me for six years . A girl must play the game , if she 's at all decent and wishes to preserve a shred of self-respect .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Again there is a pause and then JIMMIE silently resumes her seat in the arm-chair .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. UPJOHN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Moistening her lips with her tongue — to JIMMIE .</stage>‘ Ow do you feel about it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JIMMIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Thoughtfully .</stage>How do I feel about it ?<stage>To LILY .</stage>May I say ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coldly .</stage>Certainly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JIMMIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rubbing the arm of her chair with the palm of her hand .</stage>Well , if I were on board a ship at this moment , I should be ringing for the stewardess ; that 's how I feel about it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Throwing herself , face downward , at full length upon the settee .</stage>Oh ! Oh , you 're just like the rest of our girls on the question of marriage ! You — you — you 're detestable !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JIMMIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sliding out of her chair and kneeling at the settee and putting an arm round LILY .</stage>Oh , Lil — Lil ——!</p>

     <p><stage>Suddenly , releasing herself .</stage>Oh ——!<stage>Haughtily .</stage>Thought you were Lily .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MRS. UPJOHN returns , carrying a pair of stockings . LILY seats herself upon the fauteuil-stool where , concealed by the centre table , she draws on the stockings with MRS. UPJOHN 'S assistance .</stage>

     <speaker>LILY</speaker>

     <speaker>JIMMIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Who has moved over to the right — to ROPER .</stage>Be careful . I should advise you not to risk it .</p>

    <stage>He disappears , closing the door , as MAUD enters from the bedroom with a pair of shoes .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Weakly .</stage>Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Get me something to keep these up with .</p>

     <p><stage>Snatching the shoes from MAUD .</stage>Ribbon .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MAUD opens one of the drawers underneath the further cupboard on the left and finds a roll of bright , new ribbon , while JIMMIE , searching among the objects on the centre table , discovers the case of manicure instruments and takes from it a pair of scissors .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>

     <p>Do n't agitate yourself , dearie . Mother 's ‘ ere .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MAUD comes to the centre table with the ribbon and JIMMIE cuts off two lengths from the roll .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAUD</speaker>
     <p><stage>To JIMMIE .</stage>Morning , Miss Jimmie !</p>

     <p><stage>To MAUD .</stage>Morning !</p>

     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>To MRS. UPJOHN .</stage>Where 's the mirror ? Where 's the mirror ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. UPJOHN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taking the mirror from the table and giving it to LILY .</stage>‘ Ere it is , dearie ; ‘ ere it is . An ’ I 'm ‘ ere too .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Viewing herself in the mirror and running her hand over her hair .</stage>Oh , how horrid I look !<stage>JIMMIE goes to LILY with the two lengths of ribbon and MAUD replaces the roll in the drawer .</stage>Ring the bell .<stage>JIMMIE hands LILY the garters , relieving her of the mirror , and MRS.

    <sp>
     <speaker>MAUD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Going to the bedroom door .</stage>Ha , ha , ha ! Ho , ho , ho ! That 's how I like to hear her talk . Ha , ha , ha , ha !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MAUD vanishes into the bedroom , closing the door , and LILY , having tied up her stockings , rises and comes to the settee .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. UPJOHN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Still pressing the bell-push .</stage>Now I do n't believe I 've rung .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>At the uttermost tension .</stage>Ah , stop it , mother ; stop it !<stage>Sitting on the settee .</stage>We 're not calling the fire-brigade .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JIMMIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>At the back of the settee , to LILY .</stage>I 'll wait in your bedroom till the men have been shown up , and sneak out that way .<stage>Bending over LILY .</stage>Mind ! If Nicko is willing , after all , that you should make your choice ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. UPJOHN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Advancing .</stage>Yes , dearie , if ‘ e is willing ——</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Frantically .</stage>
      <l>I tell you I have made it . I keep on telling you</l>
      <l>I 've chosen — I 've chosen — I 've chosen !</l>
      <stage>Clenching her hands .</stage>
      <l>If you torment me any more , either of you ——!</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <stage>MRS. UPJOHN and JIMMIE retreat precipitately to the bedroom door . They open the door and then , standing in the doorway , listen intently .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JIMMIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Disappearing .</stage>Ah ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. UPJOHN</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Partially disappearing .</stage>
      <l>Ah —!</l>
      <stage>Only her head visible , speaking to LILY in a hoarse whisper .</stage>
      <l>Mother 's ‘ ere , dearie .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <stage>The head is withdrawn and the door softly closed . After a pause , GLADYS enters at the other door followed by JEYES and FARNCOMBE . The men are carrying their hats and canes . GLADYS retires , closing the door , and JEYES comes to LILY and shakes hands with her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>To LILY , gently .</stage>How are you to-day , Lil ? Very fagged ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Almost inaudibly .</stage>I am a little .<stage>JEYES turns from her , to lay his hat and cane upon the box-ottoman , and then FARNCOMBE , who has hung back , advances hesitatingly to the further side of the centre table and bows to LILY . She rises and , avoiding his eyes , gives him a limp hand across the table .</stage>How d'ye do ?<stage>To JEYES who , having got rid of his hat and cane , moves away from the ottoman .</stage>Sit down , wo n't you ?<stage>She resumes her seat upon the settee and JEYES , with a nod , sits in the arm-chair by the centre table . FARNCOMBE remains standing and again she addresses him without meeting his eyes .</stage>And you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>FARNCOMBE , with another bow , sits upon the fauteuil-stool . There is a brief silence and then JEYES speaks .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>Lil ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Y-yes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>In the first place , Farncombe wants you distinctly to understand how it is he 's committing this breach of his compact with you .<stage>To FARNCOMBE .</stage>You promised ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>I promised never to attempt to come near Miss Parradell again , nor even to enter the theatre .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>To LILY .</stage>And if I 'm any judge of a man , Lily , Farncombe would have kept his promise . He 'd have kept it faithfully , but for me . I 've brought him along — insisted on it .<stage>Emphatically .</stage>I 've brought him along . See ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>W-w-why , Nicko ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>I 'll tell you , my dear . You remember , when we left you early this morning , ordering us to walk away together and to part good friends ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>P-perfectly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>Well , we did walk away together , and we did part good friends . But we did n't part at all till some hours later , in his rooms . We did n't part till I 'd made him stand by me and listen to me while I had a long jaw with my brother on the ‘ phone .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Wonderingly .</stage>With — your ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>About that Rhodesian business .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>What Rhodesian business ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>I mentioned it to you yesterday . Bob owns a third , with Peter Chalmers and Tom Dalby , of a group of farms near Bulawayo , and he 's been badgering me eternally to cut this and to settle out there as their agent .<stage>Simply .</stage>And I 've accepted , old girl .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a blank face .</stage>Ac-cepted ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Grimly .</stage>Leaving you to bring an action against me , to recover damages for a broken heart .<stage>Drawing a deep breath .</stage>Yes , I 'm chucking you , Lil . I give you formal notice of my intention ; and you can drive down to your solicitors this afternoon and instruct them to writ me without delay .<stage>Forcing a laugh .</stage>Ha , ha , ha !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Faintly .</stage>Nicko ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>Unless — unless you 've an idea of consoling yourself shortly with — with another chap , and prefer not to carry the matter into Court .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>About to rise .</stage>Nicko ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Restraining her by a gesture .</stage>H'sh ! No , no , no .<stage>She sinks back .</stage>Ah , Lil — Lil — I know you 're full of generous , honest impulses , though I did tear you to rags in Farncombe 's hearing a few hours ago . But I 'm not going to allow you to sacrifice yourself to them ; I — I — I 've come to my senses , and I 'm not going to permit it .<stage>Bending forward .</stage>Oh , my dear , why should I make you pay for the weaknesses of my character ? Because that 's what it ‘ ud amount to . I 've bullied you for having played skittles with my life , my career . So you have ! Damn it , so you have ! But you 've done it out of blind thoughtlessness ; and if I 'd been a fairly strong man , with some ballast in me , you could n't have landed me where I am — not you nor fifty Pandora girls !<stage>Sitting erect .</stage>And that — that 's the moral of the tale ; and — and —<stage>abruptly , to FARNCOMBE</stage>There 's nothing more , is there , Farncombe ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Brokenly .</stage>Except that — that I 'd like to repeat — what I 've already said to Jeyes — that I —<stage>his elbows on the table , his head bowed</stage>oh , you make me feel terribly small , Jeyes .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Again there is a pause , and then LILY struggles to her feet and holds out her hand to JEYES uncertainly , and at once he rises and takes her in his arms . FARNCOMBE also rises and , standing behind the settee , turns his back to JEYES and LILY .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>To JEYES , choking .</stage>Ah , Nicko — I can n't — I can n't ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Patting her shoulder .</stage>Ah ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>Why , what — what would become of my resolutions ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>Resolutions ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>To — to raise you up , Nicko .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>You are raising me up — setting me on my legs again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a fright .</stage>And — and drawing Eddie into my net !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>Oh , we 've talked of that too , he and I . He 's given me an account of what passed between you here . My dear girl , your conscience may be quite clear on that point . Nobody can ever reproach you with trying to draw him into your net .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>They would — they would ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>At all events , the task you have to face now is to prove to the world — his world — that Miss Parradell is equal to playing “ lead ” on a bigger stage than the stage of the Pandora .<stage>Holding her at arms ’ length and shaking her fondly .</stage>And you 'll do it ! Ho , ho , ho , ho ! You 'll do it ! Ha , ha , ha —!<stage>His voice dies away miserably and he releases her . Then , pulling himself together , he looks at his watch .</stage>Well , I 've got to lunch with Bob at half-past one at the Junior Carlton ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Agitatedly .</stage>Ah , it 's not nearly that , Nicko ; it 's not nearly that ! Nicko —!<stage>She passes him , moving towards the door on the left as if to intercept him , and then turns to him . A strip of ribbon lies upon the spot where she has been standing . After gazing at it for a moment , he stoops and picks it up .</stage>Oh —!<stage>He folds the ribbon carefully and puts it into his pocket .</stage>Oh —!<stage>Hitching up her stocking through her robe , piteously .</stage>Ha , ha !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>Ha , ha , ha ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They face one another , laughing , and then she sits upon the fauteuil-stool and drops her head upon the table and he fetches his hat and cane from the box-ottoman .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Weeping .</stage>Nicko — Nicko ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coming to her .</stage>Oh , this is n't good-bye , Lil , not by any manner o ’ means , my dear . We 'll kill the fatted calf several times before I start — you , I , and the boy . Besides , by-and-by , you and he must take a trip and come out to see me . “ Seringa Vale ” is the farm where I shall be quartered , Bob tells me .<stage>Looking into space .</stage>Jermyn Street to Seringa Vale !<stage>Shaking himself .</stage>Ph'h , there are no great distances in these days !<stage>To FARNCOMBE , with a change of tone .</stage>Farncombe —<stage>FARNCOMBE comes forward .</stage>You dine with me to-night , recollect ; it 's an engagement .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>Eight o'clock .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>Eight o'clock .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p>Catani 's .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>Catani 's .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Without looking at LILY again , JEYES goes to the door and opens it . FARNCOMBE follows him and the two men halt in the doorway .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>To FARNCOMBE , with a motion of his head towards LILY .</stage>And afterwards — you fetch her from the theatre and take her home . That 's your job .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rising .</stage>Oh ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>FARNCOMBE goes out on to the landing with JEYES and parts from him at the top of the stairs . Then FARNCOMBE slowly returns , closes the door , and finds LILY sitting upon the settee in a woeful attitude .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coming to LILY and standing before her , thoughtfully .</stage>Lily ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Feebly .</stage>Eh — eh ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>I 'm afraid there 's one thing finer than winning the woman you love and , when you 've won her , being prepared to go through fire and water for her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>What 's that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>Having the courage to give her up , as Jeyes has done .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a renewed outburst .</stage>Oh , Nicko ! Poor Nicko ! Poor Nicko !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sitting beside her and taking her hand consolingly .</stage>By George , he 's a brick , is n't he !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>After a pause , drying her eyes .</stage>Eddie ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p>Yes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>If — if ever we marry ——</p>

     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p>W-w-when , then . When we marry , you 'll be obliged to resign your commission in the Guards , wo n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNCOMBE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Snapping his fingers .</stage>P'sh ! I sha n't care a rap about that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Snatching her hand away .</stage>The snobs ! The snobs ! They 'd let you marry any bit of trash in your own set ; but a Pandora girl , though she 's as pure as the Queen of England ——! Oh , the contemptible snobs !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
