   <head>ACT I</head>
   <stage>SCENE : A room in MR. FARADAY 'S country house ; at the upper left corner a little room is recessed , in which is a folding card table and four chairs . Windows at back . On table are two decks of cards , an ashtray and two bridge-markers and pencils . Hanging over table , a shaded electrolier . There is no door , but people sitting at the card tables are practically off the stage , though they can be seen and heard . At right corner balancing left corner exactly is seen a portion of the morning room ( backing used is part of Act III set ) . Directly against back is a small table , between two chairs , both of which are facing it . On table , a lighted lamp and an English periodical , also an ashtray and a vase of spring flowers . Note : All flowers used in this set are spring flowers . Between card room and morning room on back flat , a tapestry is hung , against flat a baby grand piano , keyboard facing right up and down stage ; on piano are a scarf , photograph frames , vase of flowers and a lamp . In the center of the left wall of the room , proper is hung a large picture ; beneath this stands a large cabinet on which is formal garniture . Below this is a door ( L. I ) which leads into the hall ; above door and to left center , a table on which is a sliding book rack holding several books and an English army list . Also a shaded lamp , a purse for LADY TRENCHARD to left of table , and a sewing-bag for AUNT IDA to right of table .</stage>
   <stage>In R. I is a door balancing that in L. I . It leads to hall . Above door R. is a large mantel . Above this is hung a large picture , balancing that on left wall . On the mantel , a formal garniture of vases ; against mantel , a club fender with upholstered top , fireirons inside fender , grate with lighted coal fire ; below fender , facing sofa , an armchair . Opposite and facing the fender and about three feet from it is a large comfortable sofa , with a number of cushions ; against the back of this , a long magazine table . On this are , beginning at upper end , an English timetable , a large shaded lamp , large cigarette box containing cigarettes , ashtray , match-holder , vase of tulips , photo frame , and at extreme lower end of table seven or eight English periodicals . On these , a large blue linen envelope , unsealed , flap being turned in . This contains a few spring fashion plates . With this are four ordinary letters , containing circulars ( all of these letters are important ) . Below table , a square tapestry stool , left of table an armchair , under table a waste-paper basket . Between piano and entrance to morning room is a small light writing table . On this , a small lamp or a pair of shaded candles , a blotting pad with paper , envelopes , ink and pens . Above this a chair . Off L. a door bell and set of chimes . Electric light switch on R. wall to R. of morning room opening . Bell push on L. of back flat . The entire room should convey the impression of quiet , dignified , tasteful elegance . Complete darkness at windows , suggesting a rainy night . On rise of curtain , all lamps are lighted and fire aglow .</stage>
   <stage>Before the curtain rises , PHYLLIS plays for a moment or two .</stage>
   <stage>AT RISE : Discovered : PHYLLIS at piano , playing . LADY TRENCHARD seated at upper end of sofa , smoking a cigarette and reading a periodical . MADGE writing a letter at writing table up stage . AUNT IDA seated in armchair at R. of table L ,. knitting . The girls and AUNT IDA are in evening dress . PHYLLIS continues to play softly under conversation , something cheerful but not too fast . The opening scene should be played brightly and quickly .</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . ( Rises . Brightly ) Oh , Evelyn ——</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . Yes , Madge .</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . ( Coming down to chair L. of table R. with letter in hand ) I do want this letter to my husband to catch the Indian mail . Do you know anything about the postal service in this benighted village ?</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . ( Continuing to read and speaking over her magazine ) No , Madgie , I do n't . Celia always attends to those things . She 's away . Ring for Martin .</stage>
   <stage>( MADGE goes to bell in upper flat L ., rings it , and then comes L. C . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Without looking up from her knitting ) Has anyone gone to the wharf to meet Celia ?</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . ( Indifferently ) Why , no . She 's coming home to-night , is n't she ?</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Vehemently ) You got her telegram .</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . ( Unconcerned ) What time is her boat due ?</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . At eight , and now it 's nearly nine .</stage>
   <stage>( Enter MARTIN R. IE . and stands . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Continuing ) She 'll have been waiting for an hour on that dreadful wharf .</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . ( Still reading and speaking over her book ) Oh , Martin , the motor must go at once to the wharf to fetch Miss Celia .</stage>
   <stage>MARTIN . Yes , your Ladyship , but had n't I better send down some extra wraps ; it 's a very wet night .</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . ( Looking up for a moment ) Wet ? Dear me , is it raining ?</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Cats and dogs .</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . ( Returning to her reading ) Oh , very well , then , Martin , attend to it at once .</stage>
   <stage>MARTIN . ( Turns to go to door R .) Yes , your Ladyship .</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . ( From L. C . ) Attend to me first , Martin , if you please .</stage>
   <stage>MARTIN . ( Turns back ) Yes , madam .</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . How late can I post in order to catch the Indian mail ?</stage>
   <stage>MARTIN . Up till ten o'clock , madam .</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . ( Going back to desk ) Oh , then I have time to write a longer letter . ( MARTIN exits R. I .)</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Looking around at girls , who are all occupied and quite oblivious of CELIA 'S discomfort . With a deep sigh and shaking her head ) Poor Celia .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Gives a slight bang on the piano , rises and comes quickly down center . Indignantly ) Poor Celia . Well , she 's coming back home just at a moment that 's going to complicate — the — whole — situation .</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . Why , what do you mean ?</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Addressing EVELYN ) Well , you know how father feels about letting me get married — while Celia is settling down day after day into a permanent old maid . If she 'd stay away a little longer , he might forget for a while , but here she 's turning up just this very night , just as Bobby has gained courage enough to take the bull by the horns and beard the lion sulking in his tent .</stage>
   <stage>( Enter TARVER in evening dress , dejectedly , R. U ., coming down center . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . What an extraordinary proceeding .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Running up to BOBBY and taking him by the arm ) Oh ! Bobby , Bobby ! What news ?</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . Well , I 'm afraid it 's hopeless , though I spoke with singular force . ( Sits in chair left of table R .)</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Stands L. of chair , L. of table R .) Oh , Bobby , how splendid of you ! How did you put it ?</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . In the form of a question . I said to your father , “ Are you aware , sir , that I love your daughter and wish to make her mine ? ”</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . What did Father say ?</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . Oh , he said , “ Has it escaped your observation , sir , that I still have two marriageable daughters ? ”</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Protestingly ) But he has n't , he has n't .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Eh ?</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . You know what I mean , Aunt Ida . I 'm marriageable , but Celia — well — Celia 's just — unmarried .</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . ( With smiling sarcasm ) And very likely to stay so .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Grunts ) Huh !</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . That 's just it , but tell me , what is your father 's dearest wish in life ?</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . To get rid of us both , of course .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Phyllis Faraday !</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . ( Putting magazine on sofa and putting out cigarette on ashtray ) Yes , so that he can give up this house to live at his club , but he promised poor mother to wait till we were all married ——</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . Yes , and he knows there 's a better chance of getting Celia off his hands as long as Phyllis is about , because people will go on talking of her and Celia as the two Faraday girls , and lumping good old Celia into the girl division just out of habit . He wo n't risk letting Miss Celia put on a third pair of green stockings . ( TARVER looks around for ashtray , sees one on upper end of table , rises , goes to upper end of table , flicks ashes on tray and strolls down right of sofa and sits lower end of fender . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Eh ? Will you tell me what all this has to do with Celia 's stockings ?</stage>
   <stage>( PHYLLIS sits in chair L. of table R .)</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . ( Rising leisurely , going to lower end of table , taking her fan and crossing to AUNT IDA , speaking as she goes ) Not Celia 's stockings , Aunt Ida , her green stockings .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Eh ?</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . Why , yes . Have you never known of the old country custom which requires an elder sister to wear green stockings at the wedding of her younger sister , if that younger sister has captured a husband first ?</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Turning her back to EVELYN with disgust ) No , I never heard of such rubbish .</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . ( Patronizingly , crossing to head of table R. and speaking as she crosses ) And poor old Celia has had to put them on twice already . Once for Madge and once for me , and now comes Phyllis . ( Puts her hand on PHYLLIS 'S shoulder . )</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . And if I have to wait to be married until Celia is out of the way —— ( Sighs . EVELYN moves above table and down R. of sofa . ) Oh , could n't we think of anybody who might marry Celia ? Evelyn , do you think you could do anything about it with Henry Steele or Jimmie Raleigh ?</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( With a brilliant inspiration ) If it comes to that , why should n't Admiral Grice be got to marry Miss Celia ? ( Everybody exclaims and throws up their hands in horror . )</stage>
   <stage>( EVELYN sits on sofa . )</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Horrified ) Oh , Bobby !</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . Yes , Grice . ( Thoughtfully , strolling center below table ) Is n't half a bad idea , come to think of it . I 'd like to get even with Grice . ( AUNT IDA gives a grunt of disgust . ) The way he keeps roaring questions at me all day about my election , and neither he nor Miss Celia are what you might call — in the first bloom of their youth .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Interrupting sharply ) Mr. Tarver , my niece , Miss Celia Faraday , is a dear , delightful young woman , still under thirty .</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . ( Again with smiling sarcasm ) Yes , but how much under , Aunt Ida ?</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . Yes , as Lady Trenchard says , how much is Miss Celia Faraday under thirty ? Thirty-two is freezing-point , remember . ( PHYLLIS laughs . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Tcha ! ( Picks up knitting and goes on with it angrily . )</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Chuckling to himself and strolling right to foot of table ) Jimmie Raleigh said a very true thing about her . He said , “ Whenever I talk to Miss Faraday , I 'm warranted to stay cold for days — like a Thermos bottle . ” ( Sits on stool . )</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . Oh , Bobby !</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Oh , Mr. Tarver ! ( Smiling with suppressed fury ) I should like to have you in Chicago for a week .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Taking her seriously ) Oh , thanks awfully . I dare say some day , after my election , I shall have to look up America . Just at present , though , I have too much on my mind .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Should n't overburden the weak , Mr. Tarver .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Showing resentment ) Oh , Aunt Ida ! ( EVELYN laughs . )</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Rises , gives AUNT IDA a resentful look , turns up R. by fender and addresses EVELYN ) But the great thing now is to get old Grice to propose to Miss Celia .</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . ( Very patronizingly ) Why , yes , Bobby . Then out of gratitude she might go out and canvass for you .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Doubtfully ) Ye-es , that would be very nice , of course . ( Rises enthusiastically . ) But fascinating girls are what is needed at a time like this — like you , Lady Trenchard , and Phyllis and Mrs. Rockingham . ( He bows to each as he addresses them . Going up to MADGE at desk R .) I say , when is your husband coming back from India ?</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . Not till Christmas . ( Rises . )</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . Then you can spend all your time canvassing for me , can n't you ?</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . ( Patronizingly ) Oh , of course , Bobby .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Crossing L. to C .) Thanks awfully . And you two girls can do the same . But your sister — well —— ( MADGE comes to head of magazine table . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Turning on him quickly ) Well , what , Mr. Tarver ?</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Very diffidently ) Well , I 'm afraid she would n't be of much use — you see , she 's rather difficult — is n't she ?</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Difficult !</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Seeing he has made a break , tries to recover himself ) Well , not quite the sort of person to make friends for one , do n't you know ?</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Growing more and more enraged , rises and faces him ) Mr. Tarver !</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Now thoroughly frightened ) Well , shall we say a ,— a — a trifle cold ?</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Backing him across stage to foot of table R .) Yes , and who has made her a trifle cold — ( Imitating TARVER ) - and difficult ? You and your Henry Steeles and Jimmy Raleighs .</stage>
   <stage>ALL THE GIRLS TOGETHER . Aunt Ida !</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . Oh , I say !</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Yes , where is she now , I would like to know ? Freezing for an hour on an open wharf in the pouring rain , three miles away , because nobody took the trouble to think of her .</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . ( Coming center . Protestingly ) Oh , Aunt Ida , I heard the motor leave not two minutes ago .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Yes , just about two hours too late . ( MADGE goes above table and joins girls , who with TARVER are evidently alarmed under AUNT IDA 'S attack and express it in a murmur . TARVER sits . ) Oh , if only she does n't get tired of waiting before the motor can get there .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( To girls ) Do n't worry . Do n't worry . Why should she get tired ? It would look like a lack of confidence in you if she stopped waiting .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Yes , and Celia is certainly accustomed to waiting for and on every one of you .</stage>
   <stage>GIRLS and TARVER . Now , you know —— Oh , I say .</stage>
   <stage>( MADGE turns up to piano . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Continuing ) She is a back number . That 's your constant suggestion , and because she has n't found a Jim Raleigh to love her , she is on the shelf — ( Disgustedly ) — a Jim Raleigh .</stage>
   <stage>( TARVER and PHYLLIS rise and she consoles him . )</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . ( Entering gayly through morning room ) Hello , what 's that about me ? ( Goes directly to AUNT IDA . They turn to table L .)</stage>
   <stage>( AUNT IDA flustered and exclaiming . Immediately following RALEIGH are FARADAY , GRICE and STEELE in the foregoing order . They are chatting and smoking and are all in evening dress . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Cheerily ) You do n't mind , girls , if we bring in our cigars ?</stage>
   <stage>MADGE and EVELYN . Not at all , Father .</stage>
   <stage>( FARADAY crosses immediately to card table and looks it over . )</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . ( Coming down R. of sofa . Gruffly to TARVER ) Tarver , I want to ask you a question .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Going reluctantly to him ) Yes , sir .</stage>
   <stage>( PHYLLIS looks reproachfully at GRICE and sits again in chair L. of table R ., swinging her foot and watching TARVER and GRICE . STEELE goes to head of sofa and talks with LADY TRENCHARD . MADGE remains by piano , turning over music . RALEIGH crosses to left of table , above table , still talking to AUNT IDA . All of this business occurs almost simultaneously and quickly . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Coming out of card room . Irritably ) Madge , where are those new markers ?</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . I do n't know , Father . Celia attends to everything .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Coming down center . Testily ) Well , God bless my soul , where is Celia ?</stage>
   <stage>( MADGE gradually comes down C ., R. of FARADAY . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Facing him . Vehemently ) God bless your soul , William Faraday , down on the wharf in the pouring rain ——</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . What 's that ?</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Continuing ) Frozen to death by this time .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . God bless my soul !</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Continuing ) For all any one cares .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . But I need her . She must be sent for at once .</stage>
   <stage>( Door opens suddenly . CELIA , in dripping oilskins and drenched veil , carrying a soaking wet traveling bag , enters and crosses immediately from L. IE . to R. I. All give start of surprise . )</stage>
   <stage>OMNES . Celia ! Miss Faraday ! ( Etc . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Darling !</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . ( As CELIA gets center . Coming down center ) We did send the motor for you , Celia , only it was too late .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Pausing at door ) Yes , I know , Madgie , but when I met him , he would n't stop . He took me for the fish-monger —— ( Exit quickly R. IE . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Fish-monger ! God bless my soul !</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . ( Idiotically to girls ) She must have walked .</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN and PHYLLIS . Why , yes .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Well , she could hardly sleep on the wharf , could she ?</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . ( To STEELE ) What an unfortunate way that poor woman has of doing things that make everyone feel uncomfortable .</stage>
   <stage>STEELE . ( To GRICE ) Yes , the idea of her walking up here alone in the rain !</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . ( To girls ) Wherever did she get the clothes ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Off stage ) Martin , send to the station at once for my hat and coat and return these things to Wilson . He borrowed them from the pilot .</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . Wilson ?</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . ( Patronizingly ) He is the man at the station . He 's Celia 's slave .</stage>
   <stage>( CELIA re-enters without oilskins and stands at door R. She is in a simple traveling dress . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( From center of stage ) God bless my soul , Celia , where have you been ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Why ; I 've been away , Father , for a week . Perhaps you have n't noticed it .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Not noticed it ? I have missed you very much . I never get all the right things for breakfast when you 're away !</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Sorry , Father . ( CELIA crosses quickly to AUNT IDA , who is in the center of the stage , FARADAY having turned and gone up into the card room . CELIA nodding as she crosses , to the ADMIRAL and the girls ) Good evening , Admiral . Well , girls .</stage>
   <stage>( ADMIRAL acknowledges her greeting with a grunt , STEELE with a stiff bow , and the girls say , “ Good evening , CELIA . ” )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Well , Aunt Ida .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Kissing her on both cheeks ) Dear child !</stage>
   <stage>( CELIA passing L. over to MR. RALEIGH , who is left of table L. CELIA offers her hand , which he takes with a very bored air . Meanwhile , the groups break up after CELIA has passed .

   <stage>RALEIGH . After dinner .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Oh .</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . You have been away quite a long time , Miss Faraday ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Yes , for me .</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . Yes , I mean for you . Well — nothing much has happened .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Well , one hardly expects much , does one ?</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . No . Oh , Manners has got himself engaged .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Really ? To Jennie Woodcote , I suppose ?</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . Yes ; they were all saying it was her last chance .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Yes , they would .</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . Of course , that 's all nonsense . Nowadays , there 's no — a ——</stage>

   <stage>RALEIGH . Exactly ! ( Then catching himself up in great confusion ) No , no ! Good Lord , no ! I did n't mean ——</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Coming forward L. C . ) Well , we might as well have some bridge . ( Murmurs of “ Oh , splendid ! ” )</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . ( With a shout of relief backs away from CELIA toward card room ) Bridge ! Oh , splendid !</stage>
   <stage>( EVELYN and STEELE go slowly to card room . TARVER starts L .)</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . ( Quickly ) Tarver , I have another question to ask you .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( To FARADAY , enthusiastically ) Admiral Grice plays a ripping game .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Gayly ) Come along , Admiral . Come along .</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . ( Crossing left . FARADAY takes him by the arm . They go up to card room together , chatting gayly ) Not bad . Not bad .</stage>
   <stage>( These last few lines are played very quickly . CELIA has remained in chair R. of L. table after RALEIGH has gone to card room . AUNT IDA and MADGE are standing up stage and those who have gone into the card room seat themselves in the following fashion , after the settling of partners in dumb show : RALEIGH is seated down stage , his back to the audience ; LADY TRENCHARD to his right , FARADAY to his left , and ADMIRAL GRICE opposite him . They begin their game of bridge . TARVER has gone up R. of sofa , getting a cigarette at head of table . PHYLLIS throws herself lightly on the sofa on her knees , gathering up CELIA 'S letters and flourishing them at her . )</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . Celia , here are some letters for you .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Crossing to chair L. of table R. and sitting ) Letters for me ?</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . One is a big one . ( Gives CELIA letters , kneeling on sofa . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . I do n't suppose any of them are very important .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Pityingly ) No , I do n't suppose so .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Looking at letters ) Circulars . Circulars . ( Tears open one envelope and takes out circular letter . Then seeing big envelope , says brightly as she picks it up and draws out fashion plates ) Oh , spring fashions .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( With an air of superiority ) Oh , you do n't want those . Give them to me .</stage>
   <stage>( CELIA submissively hands them , over , leaving large blue envelope on table . PHYLLIS takes them and sits on sofa with TARVER , who has come down after lighting his cigarette . They hold hands , backs to CELIA , looking at fashions . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Reading letter that she has opened ) “ Dear Sir or Madam : Having secured our unparalleled stock of sherry wine on a falling market —— ” ( Drops envelope and opens another . Reads ) “ Dear Madam : You are cordially invited to attend our spring opening of household linens — ”</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Coming from card room ) Madge , you will play ?</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . No , thanks , I 'll finish my letter . ( Who has been talking to AUNT IDA , goes back to writing table up R. and resumes writing . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Disappointedly ) And Phyllis does n't .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Well , there 's Celia .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Coming down to CELIA ,) God bless my soul ! Of course , why did I forget ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Oh — that 's all right , Father . ( Cheerfully opening her letters ) It 's being done , you know .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( To TARVER and PHYLLIS , who are seated on sofa , holding hands ) Now , then , you two , none of that ! No holding hands ! ( They rise quickly , looking embarrassed and facing father . ) You are ; not engaged yet , you know .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Happily ) Engaged ? Phyllis and Mr. Tarver ?</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Reassuringly ) No , no , certainly not . Nothing of the kind . Cheer up , my dear . ( Patting CELIA on the shoulder ) You do n't suppose I would allow a chick like Phyllis to marry with you on my hands still ?</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Who has been watching him and listening to him ) William ! ( She takes him by the arm and they go up to the card room together . )</stage>
   <stage>( There are now in the card room GRICE , FARADAY , STEELE , RALEIGH , LADY TRENCHARD and AUNT IDA . AUNT IDA is out of sight . RALEIGH , LADY TRENCHARD , GRICE and FARADAY are playing . STEELE is circulating about above table . TARVER goes up in the morning room , sits left of table , and reads a magazine . CELIA rises and goes to PHYLLIS , who meets her below sofa . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Phyllis ——?</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Eagerly ) Oh , Celia , you do n't really mind , do you ? Just because you can n't — I mean , because you do n't want to — get married , you wo n't try to stop Bobby and me , will you ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( In a hurt tone ) Phyllis — dear ——</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Relieved ) I knew you would n't . I told Bobby ——!</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . And do you mean to say that Mr. Tarver —— ( Controlling herself with effort ) Phyllis , dear —— You ought to know — by now — there is n't anything I would n't do to make my littlest sister happy . ( Patting PHYLLIS on cheek . )</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Carelessly engrossed in her own affairs ) Oh , of course , I know that . But , Celia , you 're quite mistaken and unjust about poor Bobby .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Smiling , rather bitterly ) Oh — I hope not , Phyllis . I — can n't stand — injustice !</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Kneeling on stool R. C . ) But you are ! In spite of all his worries and preoccupations about his election , Bobby takes the greatest interest in you , Celia ——</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Crosses C. Smiles ironically ) Yes ?</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . I tell you he does ! ( Forgetting herself in her zeal ) As soon as he has time , Bobby means to do everything he can to get Admiral Grice to propose to you !</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Recoiling ) What ! !</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Crestfallen ) Oh — I ought n't to have told you , I suppose . But it 's true , all the same . ( Reproachfully ) You do n't appreciate Bobby 's noble nature , Celia . You do n't know how Bobby realizes your — your loneliness , Celia . Unless you could hear him talk about you , you 'd never guess how much darling Bobby pities you .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( In a changed voice ) Phyllis . One moment , please —— ( With an effort at calm ) Do you mean to say that you and — and Mr. Tarver have been — been discussing — me ? Oh ! ( Clenching her handkerchief . )</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . Not discussing —— ( Self-righteously ) Bobby would not discuss anybody . But — you see , Celia , we were all — Aunt Ida and all of us — talking , just in fun , about your having to wear Green Stockings once more at my wedding , and Bobby — ( Laughs to herself ) Darling Bobby , is so witty ——!</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Oh , yes — go on , Phyllis .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Injured ) Well , but he is .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Oh , yes — yes ——</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . And so Bobby was just being most awfully sweet and sympathetic about your — your position .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . My position —! ( Between her teeth ) My — position ! And so Mr. Robert Tarver was kind enough to express concern , was he — because there was no possible chance of any decent man ever wanting to marry me ?</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Half frightened ) Oh , Celia ! ( Rises . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . And he makes jokes about my stockings . ( Goes L. to chair R. of table L. and stands beside it . ) I can hear his jokes !</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . Oh , Celia ! Bobby is witty .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Ironically ) Yes , very .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( In card room ) I do n't think much of that , Admiral .</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . ( In card room ) You do n't ? What 's the matter with it ?</stage>
   <stage>( These last two lines are spoken hurriedly , almost together in card room , as CELIA 'S expression conveys to the audience her sudden determination to invent her story . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( With entire change of manner ) Call him down here , Phyllis , please , and tell him I want to speak to him .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . Celia ! ( Crossing to center ) But why ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Oh , nothing . I only want to thank him , you know , about old Admiral Grice , and tell him that he need no longer complicate his anxiety about his election with worries about me or the color of my stockings .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Startled ) Why , Celia — what do you mean ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Well , you see — ( Laughs ) — I am not quite accustomed to announcing — my engagement .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( With undisguised amazement . Haltingly ) Your engagement ? Why — it 's impossible .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Yes , that 's what Mr. Tarver says . Well , now suppose we call him down here , Phyllis , and tell him he is mistaken .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . Oh-Ce-lia ! ( Embraces CELIA gushingly . Rushes up to TARVER and calling ) Bobby , Bobby , Bobby , Bobby ! ( TARVER drops his magazine , PHYLLIS drags him down R. of CELIA . He is right of PHYLLIS . ) What do you think ? Celia 's engaged to be married .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Looks at her , greatly astonished , dropping his eyeglass ) Never !</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Sarcastically ) Thanks so much , Mr. Tarver , for your kind congratulations .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Who has run up to card room , calling ) Aunt Ida , Aunt Ida !</stage>
   <stage>( TARVER pauses a moment and then goes R ., looking over at CELIA incredulously as he goes . He finally sits on fender . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Calling up to PHYLLIS ) Oh , Phyllis , I only meant to tell you and Mr. Tarver .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Excitedly . Bringing down AUNT IDA extreme L .) Aunt Ida ! Celia is engaged to be married .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Coming down left of table and below table to CELIA . Smiling happily ) Darling — at last —— ( Kisses CELIA . )</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Dances across to center ) I can be married now . I can be married now . ( Runs across to MADGE and sits on piano stool . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . I knew that this would happen .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Did you , Aunt Ida ? ( These last two lines spoken hurriedly and together . )</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . Madge , what do you think ? Celia is engaged .</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . ( Rises , drops her pen in blank surprise ) Not really !</stage>
   <stage>( PHYLLIS runs to BOBBY , who is on fender , and they sit together , talking excitedly , and looking at CELIA . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Entering from card room . Testily ) Now then , now then , can n't you girls make a little less noise ?</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . Oh , Father ! ( Rushes to him , brings him C. She is R. of him . ) What do you think has happened ? Celia is engaged to be married . ( Pauses a moment to listen to ensuing dialogue and then runs up to card room and in dumb show tells others of CELIA 'S engagement . They also in pantomime express surprise and incredulity . They come slowly out of card room . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . God — bless — my — soul ! ( A broad grin breaks slowly on his face ) Celia — engaged ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Why , yes , Father , if you have no objection to the prospect of my leaving you .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Objection ? ( Joyfully ) Why , I 'm delighted , my dear girl , delighted .</stage>
   <stage>( AUNT IDA and CELIA exchange glances and AUNT IDA , disgusted at FARADAY , goes up to card room and talks to EVELYN . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Yes , Father , I thought you would be pleased .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Pleased ? ( With mock sentiment ) I hope I show a father 's feelings when his eldest daughter proposes to — er — desert the home-nest . ( Murmurs up in card room . Reverting to his former attitude of enthusiasm ) And who is he ? What 's the d-e-a-r fellow 's name ? Eh , Celia ?</stage>
   <stage>( EVELYN comes down extreme left . RALEIGH , GRICE and STEELE up L. C . AUNT IDA comes back of chair , R. of table L. PHYLLIS kneels on sofa , facing CELIA . TARVER comes and sits in chair below fender . )</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . ( Coming down R. C . ) Yes , Celia , tell us all about him . Who is he ? ( Sits L. of table R .)</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Standing by chair R. of table L. Slowly ) Well — he is in the army .</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . ( Quickly to STEELE ) A soldier , eh ?</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . What 's his rank ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . He 's a cap — a colonel — dear — a colonel .</stage>
   <stage>( FARADAY center , GRICE up L. C ., RALEIGH and STEELE up L. C . EVELYN L. of table L .)</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Colonel ? What 's his name ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Pause ) Smith .</stage>
   <stage>( They all show pained surprise . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Smith ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Yes , John Smith .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Smith — huh — ( Genially ) Well , of course the dear fellow is n't to be held responsible for that . Eh , Admiral ? ( Joins AUNT IDA and GRICE up C .)</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . ( To FARADAY . Coming down R. C . ) Miss Faraday engaged ? You might knock me down with a feather . My dear , I congratulate yo — him , my dear , him .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Smiling and shaking hands with GRICE ) Thank you , Admiral , thank you .</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . ( Up L. C . to STEELE ) Engaged !</stage>
   <stage>STEELE . By George ! ( They contemplate CELIA from a new point of view . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Up R. C . with AUNT IDA . Smiling broadly and rubbing his hands together ) Good — old — John — Smith !</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . ( Patronizingly ) Well , Father , he may be one of the good Smiths , you know .</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . ( From chair R .) If Celia would only stop being such a clam , and tell us .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . But , Madge dear , I have told you .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Comes down stage to R. of CELIA ) Well , Celia , I suppose he will be coming to see us soon ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Oh , yes — father — after the war . ( Leaning back on chair R. of table L .)</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Quickly ) The war ?</stage>
   <stage>( All show surprise and interest . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Yes , you see he sailed this morning on board a troop ship , for Somaliland . It was just within an hour of his leaving that he — spoke to me .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . But during that hour he might have told you something about himself .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . Oh , Father ! How absurd ! On occasions of that kind , an hour passes very quickly , ( Turns to TARVER and smiles . )</stage>
   <stage>( All laugh . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Well , I remember that when I proposed to your mother , I told her my life history three times over in the first hour . ( Goes up stage . )</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . ( Deprecatingly ) Oh , Father ! ( To CELIA ) What 's his regiment ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Oh , it is a very good one , Evelyn dear . It 's one of the West African ones , you know . It has green thing-a-majigs all down the front .</stage>
   <stage>( EVELYN goes up L. and crosses R .)</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . It sounds like a garden party .</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . Well , but — Celia — ( Rises , comes to CELIA and offers hand and passes CELIA in front of her to chair L. of table R .)</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . Oh , yes , do tell us .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Sitting L. of table R. Eagerly , to get rid of the questions ) But there is very little to tell .</stage>
   <stage>( RALEIGH and STEELE drop down R. C . EVELYN joins them . AUNT IDA is back of CELIA . GRICE is C. MADGE L. of CELIA . FARADAY drops down behind CELIA 'S chair to R. of AUNT IDA . They are new all grouped about CELIA 'S chair , except TARVER , who is in chair below fender . They all show smiling interest . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Well , you see , we had been together in the house all the week — and — er — this morning I was in the garden — alone — and — and he joined me . ( Pause . ) And — er — it was then . ( Covers her — face in mock confusion . )</stage>
   <stage>( All laugh sympathetically . )</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( From sofa ) What did he say ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Looks at TARVER and PHYLLIS and waving toward TARVER ) Oh , you know .</stage>
   <stage>( All laugh . )</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . And — are you happy ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Looking at group bending over her ) Well , I really believe that this change will make a very great difference in my life .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Patting CELIA on shoulder ) Well , I hope so , my dear child , I hope so . Now , let 's go back and finish our rubber .</stage>
   <stage>( There is a general bright buzz of conversation , such as “ By jove ! ” “ I 'll bet it does , ” “ Why , yes , Celia , ” “ Well , I should think it would , ” “ Indeed it will , ” etc . FARADAY goes up to card room with EVELYN , GRICE and AUNT IDA . They resume their bridge game in former positions . MADGE catches TARVER 'S eye and they join each other up R ., evidently talking about CELIA 'S engagement . PHYLLIS stops on sofa , talking across to CELIA , as CELIA glances over the remaining envelopes and slips them into the large blue envelope , in view of audience . )</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . ( To STEELE , L. C . ) It 's obvious that Smith did n't find it difficult .</stage>
   <stage>STEELE . ( Who is R. of RALEIGH . Looking thoughtfully at CELIA ) No , he did n't . Perhaps , we have all been mistaken . You know she is n't so bad looking — if you look long enough . ( STEELE starts to cross to CELIA . RALEIGH stops him and goes over himself . STEELE comes back of chair L .)</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . Miss Faraday , I have n't congratulated you yet . I hope you wo n't go off to Southampton soon again . We all missed you dreadfully when you were away .</stage>
   <stage>( STEELE shows impatience at RALEIGH 'S talking to CELIA . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . I 'm sure you did . My coming back as I 've done seems to have made a very great difference .</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . Oh , great . Believe me , great . Well , you 've every good wish of mine . ( Gushingly extending his hand , which CELIA takes amusedly . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Warmly ) I am sure I have , Mr. Raleigh .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( From card room ) Come , Raleigh .</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . ( Over his shoulder ) But you threw down your cards .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Well , I 'm going to take them up again .</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . ( Impatiently ) Come along , Raleigh !</stage>
   <stage>STEELE . ( Triumphantly motions RALEIGH back to card room and eagerly takes his place beside CELIA 'S chair ) What Raleigh has just said , I most warmly echo , my dear Miss Faraday .</stage>
   <stage>( RALEIGH returns and takes STEELE by the arm . )</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . You are wanted over here , Steele .</stage>
   <stage>( CELIA watches them with amusement . )</stage>
   <stage>STEELE . But I am cut out .</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . ( Taking STEELE back to card room ) Well , you can cut in again .</stage>
   <stage>( STEELE goes reluctantly back to card room , protesting to RALEIGH and looking back over his shoulder at CELIA as he goes . Those in card room resume former positions and go on with bridge game . )</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . ( Coming down to CELIA and putting her arms around her ) Celia !</stage>
   <stage>( TARVER strolls up to morning room and sits right of table and begins reading again . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Yes .</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . The Indian Mail goes out to-night-via Brindisi and Port Said .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Well ?</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . Port Said . That 's where letters to Somaliland will be transferred .</stage>
   <stage>( CELIA is startled . )</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . Oh , of course you must write to him . ( Jumps up , runs up to writing table R. C ., brings blotter from table , containing sheets of paper , envelopes , pens and ink , and puts them on magazine table ; stands above and to the R. of CELIA . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Protestingly ) But it 's too late .</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . No , the post does n't go until ten . You have just time .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Opening blotting pad and ink well ) You must , if it is only a note . He will be expecting something .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Oh , I could n't write in such a hurry .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Forcing pen into CELIA 'S hand ) You must .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Laughingly ) Well , I can n't write with you two at my elbows , you know .</stage>
   <stage>( MADGE goes slowly up into card room , turning and smiling at CELIA as she goes . )</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Running up and around and down to foot of sofa ) I sha n't look . ( Kneels on Chesterfield sofa , facing CELIA ) What do you call him ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( At a loss ) I do n't know .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Surprised ) You do n't know ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Recovering herself ) I mean , dear , I use a pet name .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . Oh , lovely , what is it ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Really , it 's too absurd , you know , Phyllis . It 's — it 's — Wobbles .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Laughing and surprised ) Wobbles !</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Yes , dear . Everybody calls him — Wobbles .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Laughing ) Celia , it 's delicious . Fancy your being married to a man called Wobbles ! ( Pretending to write in the air ) “ My darling Wobbles . ” ( Laughs and runs up to TARVER , who is seated reading in the morning room , saying as she goes ) Bobby , what do you think ? ( She tells TARVER the name of CELIA 'S fiance in dumb show as she sits opposite him . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Writing ) “ My darling Wobbles . ”</stage>
   <stage>( TARVER laughs . Laugh in card room . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Looks around to see that no one is overlooking or watching her . Writes ) “ I hardly know how to write you . It all seems too hauntingly beautiful to be true . I see your face everywhere — Wobbles . The very tulips have a look of you . Oh , dearest , do n't get wounded in the war . ” ( Leans back and laughs to herself ) Good Heavens , when I got up this morning , did I ever think that I should be doing anything like this ? ( Resumes writing ) “ This is my first love letter , Wobbles , but even I know how it ought to end . Crosses , Wobbles , crosses . One , two , three , four , five , nought , nought , nought , nought , nought . To be taken as required . Thine forever . Celia Faraday . ” ( PHYLLIS comes to right of sofa and hands envelope to CELIA . ) Thank you , dear . ( TARVER strolls down center , looking at CELIA . CELIA turns letter face down on blotter to prevent its being seen by PHYLLIS . Then seeing that she is being scrutinised by TARVER and PHYLLIS , she takes envelope from PHYLLIS , places letter in it , addresses it and seals it . Addressing letter ) “ Colonel Smith , Field Force , Somaliland , Africa . ”</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . I say , Miss Faraday .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Yes .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . I hope awfully that you will help me in my election .</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . ( Speaking from card room , turning in his chair and holding card aloft ) Yes , it 's just girls like you , Miss Faraday , who win the day .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . Righto ! !</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . ( Thumping the table ) Have you none of that suit , sir ?</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . ( Whirling around and playing ) Oh , yes , I beg your pardon .</stage>
   <stage>( MADGE comes to desk , gets her letter , goes down to foot of sofa and hands it to PHYLLIS . STEELE sees that CELIA has finished letter and comes slowly down C .)</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Of course , I will help you , Mr. Tarver . It 's awfully nice to have you ask me for help , you know .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . Oh , thanks awfully . ( Goes up and around to PHYLLIS , who is on sofa , talks to MADGE and PHYLLIS . )</stage>
   <stage>STEELE . You have finished , Miss Faraday ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Yes .</stage>
   <stage>STEELE . May I put that letter in the box for you ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . No , thanks . I will see to it .</stage>
   <stage>STEELE . Well — would n't you like to come and play a game of billiards ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . No , thank you . I really must go and change my shoes . ( Indicating her feet ) You can see that these are quite damp .</stage>
   <stage>STEELE . ( Most graciously ) I can n't be expected to see things so small as that . But — ( Getting chair from left ) Wo n't you let me talk to you for just a minute ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Rising ) I really must go and change .</stage>
   <stage>( STEELE disconsolately and slowly puts back chair , leaving it turned on stage . He stands watching CELIA for a moment , then walks up L. of table L ., looking at big picture on left wall as he goes . NOTE : EVELYN should give him a signal when CELIA exits . )</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . I will go with you , dear . ( Goes to door R. I and takes the knob in her hand . )</stage>
   <stage>( TARVER sits on fender , leans over and talks intently to PHYLLIS . )</stage>

   <stage>MADGE . It 's no bother . I have a lovely new frock I want to show you . You might want to copy it for your trousseau . ( Exit R .)</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Puzzled ) My trousseau ? ( Recovers herself ) My trousseau , oh , yes , yes , my trousseau . ( Looks quickly and vainly about for some place to hide letter , either in her dress or under the table . No one is looking at CELIA during this business . She sees large blue envelope in which she has already placed two unopened letters . NOTE : The flap of this large envelope must be turned in . She quickly holds it up and slips the letter to SMITH inside and hides it between the periodicals on lower end of table . She then looks around to see that no one has observed her and exits quickly R .)</stage>
   <stage>( PHYLLIS beckons to TARVER and he sits beside her on sofa . Immediately CELIA exits , STEELE starts after her . When he gets down R. C ., RALEIGH rushes after him , carrying a card . )</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . Where are you going ?</stage>
   <stage>STEELE . I thought perhaps Miss Faraday might let me put on her slippers .</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . ( Taking STEELE by the arm ) Well , she is not going to put them on in the hall . She has gone to her room . You come back here .</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . ( Shouts loudly and bangs table and jumps up ) Raleigh !</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Is this a game of bridge or a game of tag ?</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH and STEELE . I beg your pardon ! ( They rush back to card room and RALEIGH plays card that he has carried away . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . There now , he revoked too , and that 's game and rubber .</stage>
   <stage>( STEELE strolls down extreme L ., goes R. a few steps and stands watching door where CELIA has made her exit . )</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . ( Coming down R. C ., also looking toward door R. I ) Do I owe anything ?</stage>
   <stage>( FARADAY goes C. up stage . GRICE comes C. down stage . EVELYN comes R. of L. table with a bridge score in her hand . )</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . ( Coming down center above and to the L. of RALEIGH ) Do you owe anything ? You have revoked , lost the rubber , played the worst game I have ever seen , and now you ask if you owe anything . Yes , you owe Lady Trenchard three and six .</stage>
   <stage>( RALEIGH turns L. to EVELYN and pays her . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Moving R. toward morning room ) Come and have a whiskey and soda .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . Whiskey and soda . What , ho ! ( He rises . )</stage>
   <stage>( GRICE , FARADAY and TARVER exit through morning room . Enter MARTIN L. I with salver . STEELE starts for door R. I and gets to door . RALEIGH goes up to morning room . Just as he gets to the door , he sees STEELE , who is about to exit after CELIA . )</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . No , you do n't , Steele . You come along here .</stage>
   <stage>( STEELE goes up R. of sofa and exits with RALEIGH , protesting . There is a general lively subdued conversation during these exits . )</stage>
   <stage>MARTIN . ( When only PHYLLIS and EVELYN are left on the stage ) It is time for the letters , your Ladyship .</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . ( Goes L. above table , adding up her bridge score and deferring the matter to PHYLLIS ) Oh , Phyllis .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Crossing to MARTIN with letter that MADGE has given her ) Here 's one of Mrs. Rockingham 's . ( MARTIN comes C ., takes it and turns to door L. PHYLLIS turns back R. Stopping ) Oh , Martin . ( MARTIN stops at table R .) Has Miss Faraday given you one ?</stage>
   <stage>MARTIN . No , Miss .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . I will call her — Wait a minute — Perhaps she left it here . ( Warn electrician for lights out . PHYLLIS looks about on table and writing desk , then returns to table . She aimlessly rummages through pile of periodicals at foot of table , knocking them off on the floor . In replacing them , she comes across blue envelope , and in picking this up by one corner , the letters that CELIA has put in it , including the “ Smith ” letter , fall to the floor . She goes to replace the letters , sees the “ Smith ” letter , and speaks ) Oh , here it is . ( Reads address ) Colonel John Smith , Somaliland . ( Crosses and gives letter to MARTIN and he exits L. I . She returns to table , places two of the magazines back on it , then the large blue envelope in which she has replaced other letters , and then the rest of the magazines on top of these . All this should be done quickly and unconsciously , PHYLLIS humming while she is doing it . )</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . ( After PHYLLIS has replaced magazines ) I wonder who he is . Oh , let 's look him up in the army list . ( Gets army list from book slide , table L .)</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . Oh , let 's . ( Crosses to EVELYN and together they turn over the pages to the S 's . Reading ) “ Smith — Smith — Smith — Smith ” — Oh , here it is . “ J. N. Smith , D. S. O . ”</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . ( With mild surprise ) Distinguished Service Order .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Reading ) “ West African Rifles . ”</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . ( Crossing R. to morning room ) I suppose that 's the man .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . It must be . ( Replaces army list in book slide and runs after EVELYN toward morning room to electric light switch by door ) The Rifles wear green thing-a-majigs on their tunics , do n't they ?</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . Yes , I think they do .</stage>
   <stage>( PHYLLIS switches off light and then EVELYN puts out lamp in the morning room as they exit chatting . The room is lighted now only by the firelight and light in card room . As soon as the stage is clear , CELIA enters cautiously . She goes to table R ., looks for large envelope , finds it and throws it quickly into the fire , not looking at its contents . She stands thinking a moment , then goes to table L ., looks at book rack , snatches out army list , crosses and , after making sure that it is the army list by looking at it in the firelight , throws it into the fire . NOTE : The electrician should at this point flash on and off a thirty-two amber lamp in the fireplace to give the impression of the burning of the envelope and army list that CELIA has thrown into the fire . AUNT IDA , who has remained out of sight in the card room , enters as CELIA crosses to fire with book . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Why , Celia .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Turns around , startled . Goes to light switch up R. and turns on lights ) Oh , it 's you , Aunt Ida .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Comes down and crosses to center and sees book in flames ) Celia , what was that ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Sitting on fender and swinging her foot ) That ? The army list .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . The army list ? And you burned it ? Celia !</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Well , Aunt Ida .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Beside chair L. of table R. In low voice , almost tearfully ) Celia , darling , have you been doing something — foolish ? ( CELIA laughs . ) Is there — is there — anything peculiar about — Colonel Smith ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Smiling ) What would you call — peculiar , Aunt Ida ?</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( With great gentleness , but evidently distressed ) Forgive me , dearest . It is — is there anything about Colonel Smith you do n't want the family to know ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Yes . ( Going to AUNT IDA above chair R. Laughs ) There is — something — about Colonel Smith — I do n't want the family to know . ( Laughs . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Why , is n't he — what you said ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Looking at AUNT IDA and laughing ) He is not .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Timidly ) No —?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . He is — not !! ( CELIA , above chair R ., swings AUNT IDA into it . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Mercy , child ! Do n't drive me crazy ! He is not — not what ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Not at all . ( Looks at AUNT IDA and begins to laugh irrepressibly . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Celia !</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Bends above AUNT IDA , putting her arms about her from back and kissing her neck ) Hush — listen , dear —— Will you swear you wo n't betray me ?</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . But — Celia !</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Will you promise , Aunt Ida ? I know I can trust you if you will only really promise never to breathe a word of what I am going to tell you to any living being ?</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Well — but — I am not sure .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Oh , very well , then — if you do n't want to ( Crosses to chair R. of table L. and sits . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . No , no , Celia , I promise . There now , I have promised .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Very well , then . ( Slowly and emphatically ) There — is n't — any — Colonel Smith .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Helplessly ) There — is n't — any — Colonel ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . None .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Then who is he ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . He is n't . I invented him .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Rising ) But , Celia — your engagement ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Well , naturally I invented that too .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Celia Faraday , you are not telling the truth .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Shaking her head ) No .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Going towards CELIA ) You are deceiving everybody .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Yes .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . You are being frightfully immoral .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Yes .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Startled ) And how on earth are you going to keep them from finding out ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Taking AUNT IDA 'S hand ) Well , first of all , dear , a regiment did sail for Somaliland this morning .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Yes , but regiments sail back .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Wobbles wo n't .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Wobbles ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Laughing to herself ) Is n't that a heavenly name , Aunt Ida ,— Wobbles ?</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Turning away from CELIA reprovingly ) Celia !</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Still seated , throwing out her arms with a big gesture ) Oh , the difference that dear , dear man is going to make in my life . Oh , the difference .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Going back to CELIA and putting her hand on her shoulder ) Oh , my dearest child . Do give up this mad scheme and come back with me and be happy in Chicago .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Oh , I could n't give it up now . It 's going to be too much fun . Now be a dear and stand by me through this and then I 'll go to Chicago and stay there forever , but first let me have this one mad experience , do let me enjoy my blushing triumph as a brave and absent soldier 's adored fiancee . ( Crosses to table R. and straightens writing things . ) Do you know , Aunt Ida , I just loved writing that first love letter to him just now .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . But Celia , your letter !! !</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . That is all right , dear . I burned that . Do you know what I am going to do , Aunt Ida ? ( Suddenly throwing herself in chair L. of table R .)</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . What ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . I am going to make it a point now to shut myself alone in my room every afternoon for hours — let someone else look after the house and the servants while I correspond with Wobbles . ( AUNT IDA laughs . ) I am going to give myself a chance at last . I 'm going to do all sorts of wonderful things .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Down C .) What ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Rising and coming to her ) I do n't know what , but I 'm going to do them . One day I 'll wear a haunted look in my eye as I gaze sadly toward Somaliland . I wonder where it is . ( Looks around . ) The next , I 'll have a merry laugh or else a mocking smile . By day , I 'll wander through the woods and think of him . By night , I 'll sit before the fire and dream of him .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Celia ! Celia !</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Oh , I know I 'll be a perfect fool , but I 'll be the only one who will know it , and if one little fib can turn this household upside down , I am going to keep it there now just as long as it pleases me . ( Saunters right . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Frightened ) Celia , suppose you are found out !</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Coming back C .) Now , what should I do ? My heroic Wobbles — my beloved Colonel Smith will die — in Somaliland . ( Going to magazine table , gets calendar , comes down C. to AUNT IDA and runs over leaves . ) Now , let me see when — when will he die ? ( Stop 's at a leaf . ) On October 11th . There , now , it is all arranged . ( She replaces calendar on table . ) After eight brief months of the most perfect understanding , I shall lose — Wobbles . After eight months , I 'll write out a notice of his death and you will send it to the Times .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Slowly ) To The Times ? I ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Yes .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Never . ( Sits R. of table L .)</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . What ? Not if I promise to go with you to Chicago ? ( AUNT IDA shakes her head . ) And you know how much you always wanted me to do that . Oh , yes , you will , Aunt Ida . ( Goes to her . ) I 'll buy the tickets to-morrow . You shall have the very nicest cabin on the whole ship . On October 11th we will kill off the Colonel and the very next day we will sail away , we 'll sail away . ( Crosses R . gayly . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . I tell you , I will not help you . It 's too immoral .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Oh , very well , then . Have I , or have I not , proved now that I can help myself ?</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Rising and coming C. Half angry , half laughing ) Are you , or are you not , ashamed of yourself , Celia Faraday ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Ashamed ? I ? Why , no , not the least little bit in the world . I do n't believe I was ever so happy in all my life .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Oh , oh !</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . It 's all very well , dear , for you to “ Oh , oh ! ” at me , but I ask you , Aunt Ida , have you ever been pitied and patronized as I was here to-night , as I have been all these years , and looked upon as old and ugly and dowdy and dull ?</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Sympathetically ) Not that , Celia , not that .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Oh , do n't think I do n't know those things about myself . I do , but I do n't like to hear them all the time , just the same . Have you ever been a wall-flower at every ball you have gone to , while all the other girls danced and had a perfectly lovely time ? Have you ever been seated next to the oldest , deafest members of the community at every dinner party you have gone to ? Positively , Aunt Ida , I 've grown so now that I can n't talk at a dinner party except through an ear trumpet . ( Goes R. and then returns . ) And , if that Tarver creature or a Jim Raleigh or that old fossil of an Admiral or any other mortal trouser-wearing remnant of humanity had ever condescended to propose to me , there is n't a man or woman in this entire household , beginning with Martin and the boot boy , who would n't respect me and treat me quite differently in consequence .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Yes , I know it .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Oh , do n't I know it ?</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Yes , it has been pretty well rubbed in .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Yes , I should say it has . Well , it has just been rubbed in so hard to-night that , as Phyllis would say , the straw has broken the worm 's back and the worm has turned at last . Never , never , never again will I be content to be what I have been all these years . “ Good old Celia . ” ( Walking R .) Yes , “ Nice old thing . ” ( Walking to C .) Celia who does n't want things and Celia who looks after things and Celia who does n't mind things and Celia who attends to things . Well , Celia who attends to things is dead . Now everything attends to Celia . ( Warn curtain . From now on , gay and laughing and walking to and fro across stage with AUNT IDA slowly , her arm around AUNT IDA 'S waist . ) When the day begins and Father shouts , “ God bless my soul , what 's the matter with this coffee ? ” ( Turns right ) I 'll be upstairs in bed , drinking chocolate . And then , when the evening comes and Martin says , “ Beg pardon , Miss , but the whiskey is out , ” I 'll say , “ I do n't care . Colonel Smith does n't drink . ” ( Turns L .) Instead of keeping house accounts , I 'm going to write my love letters , and instead of ordering groceries , I 'm going to order frocks , and wait until you see the frocks I 'm going to order . ( They stop walking . ) I 'm going to be a blazing dream . I 'll be younger than the youngest of them , gayer than the gayest , and what do I care now what any of them say or do or think about me ? I 'll wear just as many green stockings as they wish at as many weddings as they please , and I 'll laugh and I 'll sing and I 'll dance them into holes , because why ? Well , I 'll have a sweetheart of my own , do n't you see ? I 'll be the lady love of — Wobbles . ( Waves her handkerchief in the air and she and AUNT IDA embrace , laughing heartily . )</stage>
   <p>QUICK CURTAIN</p>
   <stage>( Running time , thirty to thirty-five minutes , depending on laughs . )</stage>
   <p>ACT II</p>
   <stage>SCENE : Same as Act I .</stage>
   <stage>There is a slight rearrangement of furniture and addition of properties . Table and chairs L. C ., moved twelve inches nearer center . Armchair put left of table and plain chair right of table . The lamp has been moved from table to top of cabinet L ., making room for teatray laid for five people . Also on the tray is a plate containing plum cake , a three-shelf muffin-stand or curate , containing cakes and sandwiches , is placed below cabinet .

Election speech ( a roll of foolscap paper ) on cabinet L. for TARVER . Waste-paper basket removed . The curtains are drawn closer than in Act I and card table has been folded and placed against backing and chairs distributed against backing of card room . The ladies are in afternoon house dress and FARADAY in frock or morning coat . All the flowers are changed and autumn varieties replace those of spring . It is eight months later in the late afternoon . Halfway through the act , it grows darker and lights are required , though lights are full up to commence .</stage>
   <stage>As the curtain rises , PHYLLIS is seated on sofa R ., doing some embroidery . EVELYN is toying with a book , seated L. of table R. MADGE is at the head of the tea table , pouring tea . FARADAY stands to left of table .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Running over the books in book slide ) Where is that army list ? It 's a great nuisance , not a sign of the army list . The army list has disappeared again . I wanted to write to General Partington this morning and I could n't find out whether he was a K. C. B. or a K. C. S. I .</stage>
   <stage>( AUNT IDA enters through card room in outdoor dress and comes directly down L. C . She should show signs of nervous apprehension all through the opening of the Act . )</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . Tea , Aunt Ida ?</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Please . ( Nervously ) What 's the matter , William ?</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . The army list has disappeared again . I have n't seen one for months . Phyllis , will you ask Celia to order another new one ? ( Sits left . )</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS I do , Father , every time , but Celia always forgets it .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Sits on edge of chair R. of table L. On tenter hooks ) Has the Times come yet ?</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . No .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . It 's very late .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Getting up and getting muffin-stand from below cabinet , setting it between his knees ) It is always very late . I eat much too much tea every day , waiting for that Times . It 's not good for me . ( Selects a big muffin from stand . )</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . But , Father , could n't you make up your mind to restrain yourself ?</stage>
   <stage>( Enter MARTIN through card room . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . I can make up my mind all right , but I can n't restrain myself . ( Bites into the muffin . )</stage>
   <stage>MARTIN . ( Announcing ) Admiral Grice .</stage>
   <stage>( Enter GRICE through card room . MARTIN comes down L. of table to door . GRICE comes down to table . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . How do you do , Grice ? Have some tea .</stage>
   <stage>( All greet ADMIRAL in casual tones . )</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . Thanks .</stage>
   <stage>( MADGE pours him a cup of tea . He takes it and crosses and shakes hands with LADY TRENCHARD and PHYLLIS , then goes and stands below fender . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Stopping MARTIN at door L .) And Martin , see that another army list is bought . Send in to Lumley at once .</stage>
   <stage>MARTIN . Another army list , sir ? Yes , sir . ( Exit L. IE . )</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . ( In an injured tone ) Celia is not here !</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . She has gone to see old Wilson , young Wilson 's father . There is a rumor that he 's wavering .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Wavering ! Wilson ? He has some influence , too . I do hate a station master who can n't stick to his political principles .</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . What 's Wilson 's trouble ?</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . Compulsory vaccination . He can n't spell it , so he 's against it .</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . Silly ass ! Well , if anyone can settle him , it will be Celia .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . Yes , is n't she splendid ? I believe Celia could make anybody do anything .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Have you just discovered that ?</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . I do n't think that 's much of a discovery .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Nor I .</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . Yes , but Aunt Ida , you never really knew Celia before .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Before what ?</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . ( Enthusiastically ) Before she was engaged . Before she let herself go , before she showed us all the Celiaishness of Celia .</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . There is n't a finer girl in England . ( Puts teacup on mantel . ) No , nor a finer dinner than the one I 'm giving her to-night .</stage>
   <stage>( Enter TARVER L. I , elaborately dressed and spattered with mud . He leans against jamb of door weakly . Everyone but AUNT IDA starts in surprise at sight of TARVER . NOTE : AUNT IDA does not participate in this scene , being wholly engrossed in the matter of the Times . )</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Starting up , goes toward TARVER a few steps ) Bobby !!! !</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Leaning weakly against door ) I 'm dead to the world .</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . What has happened ?</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . The most awful thing .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . It was that dreadful ordeal of laying the corner stone , I suppose .</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . ( Contemptuously ) They asked you to lay a corner stone ?</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . They had to have a personage .</stage>
   <stage>OMNES . A personage !</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . You see , the beastly ground was full of puddles and , just as I stepped forward with a trowel in my hand , I slipped , and ——</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . And sat down in one of them , I suppose .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . That 's exactly what I did do . Oh ! How they all yelled . ( All laugh , ADMIRAL loudest . Coming C. and limping ) It 's all very well for you to laugh , Admiral , but that puddle may cost us the seat .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Tarver !</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . Tarver ! Bring a trowel and a pail of mortar to my garden to-morrow morning at eleven o'clock sharp . I 'll teach you how to lay a corner stone . ( Gets his cup , goes up and crosses above sofa to teatable , and puts his cup down . )</stage>
   <stage>( PHYLLIS comes C. to TARVER . )</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . Oh , Phyllis , where are my voice lozenges ?</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Taking his arm sympathetically ) They 're all gone , Bobby , but Celia said she would fetch you some .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . That 's kind of her . My throat 's awful . Where 's the spray ?</stage>
   <stage>( PHYLLIS runs up and around to R. of sofa , getting spray . TARVER sits on stool below sofa and PHYLLIS comes down to R. of him . )</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Spraying his throat ) Never mind , Bobby , there are only ten days more .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Chokes ) I do n't think I can last out the ten days . When that bench broke last night in the middle of my speech , I really thought it was my nervous system gone at last .</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . ( Thunderously . Coming C .) Tarver !</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Jumps ) Oh , Admiral , do n't speak to me like that or I shall cry .</stage>
   <stage>( PHYLLIS sits on foot of sofa , her arm on TARVER 'S shoulder . )</stage>
   <stage>GRICE , You made a mistake last night . Canada is not to the north of Alaska .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . Did I say it was ? ( PHYLLIS shakes her head . Looks toward PHYLLIS ) Oh , how awful !</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . Tarver , you are dining with me to-night .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . Yes , sir .</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . Bring your Atlas . We will go slowly through the countries of the world in my study afterwards .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Rises quickly ) Oh , but you can n't , Admiral . There 's the Philharmonic concert after your dinner party , and we all have to go to it .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . Yes , and my opponent is going to be there .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . If Bobby were late , it would produce a bad impression .</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . Then come before dinner .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Rising ) But , Admiral , I have n't written a word of my election speech yet except “ Gentlemen ” and that 's a lie .</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . ( Threateningly ) Tarver ! Wilson is not the only elector in the Lumley division who is wavering .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Starts ) Oh , Admiral !</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Seated L .) You , Grice , you ?</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . Oh , you could n't vote against Bobby !</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . Perhaps not , but I might try .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . Oh ! I 'll bring my Atlas ! ( Speaks despairingly . Turns up R ., looking for tonic . )</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Running to ADMIRAL ) Oh , yes , Bobby will be delighted to bring his Atlas .</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . Bobby will be delighted to take away his Atlas . ( MARTIN enters L. I with copy of the “ London Times ” and a small folded periodical on salver . ) Tarver , geography , eight o'clock sharp . Dinner , eight fifteen . ( Turns to table . )</stage>
   <stage>MARTIN . The Times , sir .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . At last .</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . Ah , the Times !</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Rising in alarm and backing up stage from chair . GRICE takes her place in chair . ) Oh , the Times , the Times !</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . Oh , Phyllis , where is that bottle of Guy 's tonic ?</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . It is out here , Bobby . ( Exit in the morning room . )</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Following her ) Thanks awfully . I needed it badly .</stage>
   <stage>( MADGE takes periodical and begins to read . FARADAY takes the outer sheet of the Times , pulls it off , and throws it across table . It falls to floor R. of table . GRICE stoops to pick it up . EVELYN takes it from his hand as he rises , saying , “ Thank you , Admiral . ” GRICE looks at her disgustedly and sits twiddling his thumbs . NOTE : The outer sheets of the Times must be stuck together in order to have them fall properly . NOTE : The birth , marriage and death column of the Times is in the upper left hand corner of the first page . EVELYN , MADGE and FARADAY have become absorbed in their papers . GRICE looks about him and then , exasperated , seizes a book and sits R. of table L ., reading it . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( After a pause ) I never saw a paper like this . ( Strikes paper with back of his hand . ) There is absolutely nothing in this paper .</stage>
   <stage>( TARVER and PHYLLIS re-enter , go to fender and sit . TARVER has had his clothes brushed . )</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . I never saw a paper with anything in it . ( Pause . ) How about the bye-elections ?</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Grunting , absorbed in his paper ) Huh ! ( Long pause . )</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . ( Reading front page ) Oh , Madge , Elsie Hardiman is engaged .</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . Not really ?</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( From up stage , comes slightly R. C . Uneasily and anxiously watching EVELYN ) Is n't there — is n't there any other news , Evelyn ?</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . No , dear .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Anybody married ?</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . No one we know .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( With a forced attempt at cheerfulness ) Or dead ?</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . ( Absently . Looking over paper ) No , dear . Ab — so — lutely noth —— ( Her eye suddenly lights on SMITH 'S death notice . She reads it in pantomime . A look of horror comes over her face and she utters a shrill scream . )</stage>
   <stage>( All rise hastily with exclamations . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Jumping to his feet ) God bless my soul ! What 's the matter , what 's the matter ?</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . Great Scott ! What 's the matter ?</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . What is the matter , Evelyn ?</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . ( Coming center ) Really , Lady Trenchard , you ought not to startle people like that . It 's selfish . ( Goes to her , takes paper from her limp hand and comes down stage . ) What 's the news , eh ?</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Taking paper from GRICE with importance , and crossing L .) I 'll tell you .</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . ( In hushed whisper ) Father , the deaths , the deaths !</stage>
   <stage>( During the following scene , GRICE is fairly dancing with impatience . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Reads death notice and sits heavily extreme L. with a sigh ) Poor girl !</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . ( From above table ) Father .</stage>
   <stage>( FARADAY hands paper to MADGE , saying , “ Read , read . ” )</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( After a slight pause runs across stage to MADGE ) What is it , Madge ?</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . Oh , Phyllis .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Stands by MADGE , takes paper and reads ) That does seem cruel , does n't it ?</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . Why do people want to keep the news to themselves ? ( Takes paper away from PHYLLIS and comes down C. He reads ) Whew ! ( Stands ruminating ) Well , well , well , well ! ( Holds paper to him . )</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Seated in chair below fender . Plaintively ) Will somebody kindly tell me what 's happened ?</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . Always thinking of yourself , Tarver . ( Reads slowly and impressively ) “ On October the 11th — of wounds — at Berbera , Somaliland — Colonel Smith . ”</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Feeling that he must say something ) On October the 11th — that is tough , is n't it ?</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Yes , it 's hard . I 've been inquiring about rooms at the Club . I did n't expect this .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( At head of table ) It 's more terribly and cruelly hard on Celia than it would be upon any other woman .</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . ( Putting paper on table ) Why ?</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . Because —— ( Breaks off . ) Do n't you remember the night when she told us of her engagement eight months ago . She said then that her betrothal would make an extraordinary difference in her life .</stage>
   <stage>( READY Doorbell . )</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . Then she was n't happy . Now she is .</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . And when she is , this blow falls without even a telegram to break the force of it .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . It is too horrible . Nothing but an announcement in the Times sent by post .</stage>
   <stage>( NOTE : The voices in each succeeding line should descend in scale . )</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . On October the 11th ——</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . Of wounds ——</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . At Berbera ——</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . Somaliland ——</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . Colonel Smith ——</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Rising and coming L. to stool below table ) By Jove ! If Celia withdraws from the contest , I 'm done .</stage>
   <stage>( Doorbell rings off L. TARVER sits on stool . )</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . ( Alarmed ) Was n't that the front doorbell ?</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . ( Coming down stage ) Who is to break the news to her ?</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . ( Pauses , looks around and suddenly points to TARVER ) Tarver .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Springs to his feet in horror ) Me ? No , no . I think it needs a woman 's voice . ( Waving his hands feebly up and down in front of him ) A woman 's gentle fingers .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . God bless my soul ! It is n't going to be broken to her in the deaf and dumb alphabet .</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . Let 's leave Father to break the sad news to her .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Me ! No , no . I might break down . Someone outside the family would have more command over their emotions . Some old , warm-hearted friend . ( Pause , while GRICE shows alarm . ) Grice , for instance .</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . Me ! No , no . Ah ! I have an idea . ( Comes down stage , and FARADAY , MADGE , EVELYN and TARVER gather about him , FARADAY L ., MADGE L. C ., GRICE C ., EVELYN R. C ., TARVER R. Slowly , seriously and impressively ) Let us all break it to her — gently — when she comes into the room . I 'll give the signal — one , two , three and then we 'll all say together and very gently , “ Colonel Smith is dead . ” ( Looks for approval and they all turn away in disgust . )</stage>
   <stage>( FARADAY goes extreme L ., MADGE back to head of table L ., TARVER extreme R. and EVELYN to chair R. C . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Coming down stage ) Had n't you better leave it to me ?</stage>
   <stage>( All show tremendous relief . )</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . Of course .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . You are the very person .</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . Hush ! Now everybody try to be quite calm and natural and act as though nothing whatever had happened . Oh !!! The Times !</stage>
   <stage>( All rush for the Times . GRICE seizes outer sheet of Times and looks wildly about for some place to hide it . In desperation , he thrusts it up his coat at the back . PHYLLIS seizes a sheet , runs up and hides it under piano cover . MADGE also seizes a sheet and hides it behind curtain of card room . GRICE sits R. of L. table . Everyone assumes strained positions with set grins on their faces . Enter CELIA , L. I entrance . She brings with her two small packages wrapped in tissue paper . She is dressed elaborately in outdoor costume and carries a light muff . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Brightly ) Good afternoon , everybody .</stage>
   <stage>( All give a short , nervous giggle , pause and then say together , “ Good afternoon , Celia ” CELIA crosses to chair L. of table . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Coming down L. of CELIA , offering to take her muff ) Allow me , dear .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Giving it to him ) Oh ! Thank you , Father .</stage>
   <stage>( FARADAY holds both his hands in muff . PHYLLIS solicitously takes CELIA 'S gloves . )</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . ( In a bereaved tone , offering her a cup of tea ) Celia , dear , have some tea ?</stage>
   <stage>( FARADAY goes up and around to back , R. C . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . No , thanks , Madge . I 've been having tea with the Duchess . Oh , how do you do , Admiral . ( Shaking hands across table with GRICE ) You do n't know how I 'm looking forward to your dinner party to-night . ( Sits L. of table L ., unwrapping two small parcels and placing tissue paper on book slide . )</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . ( Very gloomily ) It was a good dinner . I suppose that now ——</stage>
   <stage>( FARADAY coughs and all in a strained whisper say , “ Admiral ! ” )</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Rising and coming C .) Did you manage to catch Wilson ? ( TARVER 'S question shocks all . )</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Trying to hush him ) Bobby !</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . ( In a hoarse whisper ) Just at this time , too .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . No , Bobby , he was out ; but see what I brought you — some throat lozenges and a box to keep them in .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Comes to her at foot of table and takes boxes from her . Lugubriously ) It 's awfully good of you to think of me , Celia . ( Crosses back to L. C . ) Just at this time , too .</stage>
   <stage>( EVELYN pulls TARVER violently around R. He staggers across stage and falls in chair extreme R .)</stage>
   <stage>OMNES . Hush !! !</stage>
   <stage>( GRICE glares at TARVER , PHYLLIS and MADGE offer CELIA tea , FARADAY the muffin-stand , and GRICE offers her the plate of cake . All this is done quickly and simultaneously . )</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . You had better have some tea , Celia .</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . ( Smiling at her ) Cake , with plums in it .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Laughing ) You are all very kind to me this afternoon .</stage>
   <stage>( They all turn away hurriedly , quickly putting down the things they have been offering CELIA and laughing nervously . )</stage>
   <stage>OMNES . Not at all , dear . Not unusually so . Not a bit . ( Etc ., etc . )</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . Cake , with plums in it .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Exchanges looks with AUNT IDA , who has worked down L. after FARADAY has gone up C. AUNT IDA nods her head . Indifferently ) Any news in the Times ?</stage>
   <stage>OMNES . The Times ? The Times ? Why , no , I do n't imagine so . Have you seen the Times ? Now where has Martin put that Times ? ( Etc ., etc . NOTE : This should come to a crescendo and then die down . )</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . ( In a loud , hoarse whisper to TARVER ) Oh , say something .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Very nervously ) No , I do n't think there was anything , was there , Admiral ?</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . ( Mournfully , staring straight ahead of him ) Nothing very lively .</stage>
   <stage>OMNES . ( In a strained whisper ) Admiral !</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( To relieve situation . Gayly ) Now where has the Times got to ?</stage>
   <stage>( TARVER rises and looks in fireplace , muttering to himself . )</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS and MADGE . Where is the Times ? Have you seen the Times ? I wonder what could have happened to it ? ( Etc . )</stage>
   <stage>( GRICE rises and turns R. and starts up stage . The Times falls out from his back . There is general consternation . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Seeing Times on floor ) Why , there it is , is n't it ?</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( In mock , great surprise ) God bless my soul ! So it is .</stage>
   <stage>( TARVER sinks down on fender . )</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . ( Coming down stage and picking up paper ) Now , how did that get there ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . May I see it , if everyone has quite finished ? ( Holds out hand for paper . GRICE reluctantly gives paper to her . She opens it and reads . All watch her , strained and anxiously . Cheerfully ) Births , marriages , deaths . I always look first at that column , you know . ( After a pause . Laughing a little ) How very amusing !</stage>
   <stage>OMNES . Amusing ? Celia !! Great Scott ! God bless my soul !</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Reading ) “ On October the 11th —— ”</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . ( Almost with a sob ) Eleventh !</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . “ Elsie Hardiman to Alfred Bryce . ” ( All give tremendous sigh of relief . Looking up ) Why did n't somebody tell me Elsie Hardiman was engaged ?</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Comes to chair R. of L. table and lays muff down on book rack ) I would n't go into that , Celia . I would n't pursue that line of inquiry any further if I were you , my dear . ( Tries to take paper . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Retaining her hold on paper ) I just want to see if anybody is dead , Father . ( Puts out a hand surreptitiously and pulls AUNT IDA near her . They all watch her with tragic anxiety . She sees notice , reads it , and utters a long , low cry of grief , then lets paper drop on table and with another long moan , rises and buries her face in AUNT IDA 'S shoulder . )</stage>
   <stage>( TARVER curls up in chair extreme R ., pulling his moustache . )</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Making sympathetic motion forward ) Celia — darling .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Waving her handkerchief up and down ) Sh — sh — sh — sh ! ( They stand in grief-stricken attitudes , contemplating her . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Brokenly ) Celia — my child ——</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Waving her handkerchief up and down ) Sh — sh — sh — sh !</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . Poor Celia !</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Sh — sh — sh — sh ! ( Pause . ) I think — she will — say something soon .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Raising a flushed , quivering face from AUNT IDA 'S shoulder ) So you were all — trying to keep this — from me ?</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . ( Coming down R .) God help us , we were . ( Takes off his glasses and wipes his eyes . )</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . Ah — Celia .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( In same queer , choked way ) Would n't it be better if you all left her alone — with me ?</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Much relieved ) Quite so . Quite so . Come , children . ( Crosses a few steps up and right . The girls , with PHYLLIS first , MADGE , then EVELYN , form a line and , with bowed heads and folded hands , walk across the morning room door . TARVER rises and walks mournfully up to door . ) Come , Admiral .</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . ( Crossing up R .) No , Faraday . I 'll take my leave from this house of grief . ( Exits through card room . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Comes L. C . ) Wait , Father . ( The girls halt in doorway , TARVER above sofa ) I only want to say that I do n't intend to let this news make any difference — outwardly . You see you never knew what I knew — about him , so I can n't expect you to realize all that I 've lost . I do n't see what 's to be gained by any parade of grief , so I 'll go to this dinner party to-night and try to act as though nothing whatever had happened .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Beaming ) That 's splendid of you , Celia . It 's much the wisest not to give way to sorrow . But you will get those votes you promised me , wo n't you ?</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Take him away . Take him away .</stage>
   <stage>( EVELYN whirls TARVER around and hands him unceremoniously off the stage . FARADAY exits . There is a pause , then AUNT IDA and CELIA burst into hearty laughter . AUNT IDA crosses to table R ., sits , and CELIA sits on the arm of her chair . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Oh , Aunt Ida . Did n't we get through that splendidly ?</stage>
   <stage>( GRICE re-enters through card room . They quickly turn their laughter into sobs and bury their faces in their handkerchiefs . )</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . ( Coming down C .) I have been lingering , my dear Miss Faraday , just to grasp your hand and whisper a word of cheer . Keep up your heart , my dear . Keep up your heart . Remember there are other fish in the sea — big fish . ( Bows and elaborately exits through card room . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Old fool !— Is n't it a mercy I 'm going to escape that sort of thing ? There 'd be a dozen more if I gave them a chance , but instead of that I 'm going with you to Chicago to live and die a spinster with an unawakened soul .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( In a high tragedy tone ) Celia , I have a queer feeling we 're not done with this thing yet .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Why , of course we are , you dear ; the steamship tickets are up in my room and I 'm going with you to-morrow when you leave on the noon train . What a brick you 've been through it all , Aunt Ida , what a brick !</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Laughing , then recovering herself and endeavoring to be moral . Crossing L .) You — you — you must never do it again , Celia .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Well , it 's hardly the sort of thing one can do very often .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Seriously ) I never would have helped you send that notice to the Times , Celia , if — if — oh , dear . ( Breaks down and laughs . Severely ) Oh , but I consider your whole attitude most immoral .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Meekly ) Yes , Aunt Ida . I admit my behavior has been shocking and what a contrast to his . ( Laughs . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Reprovingly ) Celia !</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Poor Colonel Smith ! What harm has he ever done ? Was ever a career more blameless ? He lifted me down from the shelf . Dear Colonel Smith ! He died just at the right moment . Dear Colonel Smith . Oh , you know he was a true soldier . He did his work in silence . Well , peace to his ashes . Dear Colonel Smith ! Good gracious , dear , it 's getting late . It 's time to dress for dinner . ( She seizes AUNT IDA by the arm , gayly whirls her around , crosses and gets her muff from table . )</stage>
   <stage>( Enter PHYLLIS through morning room R. Runs down R. of sofa , calling , “ Celia . ” They resume attitudes of grief . AUNT IDA exits through morning room , holding her handkerchief to her eyes . )</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Comes C. to CELIA ) Celia !</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Yes , dear .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . I want you to help me . Bobby is frightfully tired . Do n't you think that he and I could cut the Admiral 's dinner party and dine quietly at home here ? You could make it all right with the Admiral , Celia .</stage>
   <stage>( Enter MARTIN , with salver and card , L. IE ., leaves door open . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . I 'll try , dear . Martin , there will be two for dinner after all .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . And may we dine in the little morning room here ? ( Indicating morning room . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . In the morning room ?</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . It will be more snug .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Oh , very well , then , Martin . Dinner in the morning room . ( MARTIN offers card to CELIA . ) I have n't time to see anyone now . ( Crosses R. to door ) Who is it ?</stage>
   <stage>MARTIN . Colonel James Nugent Vavasour . He was sure that you would consent to see him , Miss , when you saw this card .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Vavasour ? Vavasour ? It 's some election business , of course . Phyllis , it 's your affair , after all . Attend to it for me , wo n't you ?</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . Very well . ( CELIA exits R. MARTIN brings the card over to PHYLLIS . PHYLLIS takes card , reads it and utters a cry ) Colonel Smith ! Then , then — then ? ( Bewildered ) Then he is not dead . It 's a mistake . ( Runs to door R. as if to recall CELIA . )</stage>
   <stage>MARTIN . It is Colonel Vavasour who has called , Miss . ( Goes up to tea-table , gets tray and dishes . )</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . But it 's Colonel Smith 's card . ( Turns card over suddenly ) Oh , it is a message . ( Goes to L. of table R ., sits and turns up the lamp . ) Written in a failing hand . ( Reads ) “ Good-bye . Be kind to my friend , James Nugent Vavasour . ” ( To MARTIN , who has by now collected the dishes on tray and is below table R .) Show Colonel Vavasour in and then ask Miss Faraday to come down as quickly as she can . Just say that it really is important .</stage>
   <stage>MARTIN . Yes , Miss .</stage>
   <stage>( PHYLLIS comes L. C . quickly and arranges her hair , etc . MARTIN re-enters , announcing COLONEL VAVASOUR . COLONEL SMITH enters and stands . MARTIN closes door quietly , goes up L ., crosses it back , turns on lamp on piano and exits through morning room . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Bowing ) I am speaking to Miss Celia Faraday ?</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Holding card in her hand ) Oh , no . I 'm her much younger sister , but I have sent for her . Wo n't you sit down , Colonel Vavasour ? ( Sits R. of L. table . SMITH sits L .) The card which you sent me proves that your errand is a sad one . I want to ask you to be very gentle in delivering your message to Celia . The news of Colonel Smith 's death was first conveyed to her in to-day 's “ Times . ”</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . I am not very surprised to hear that .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Melodramatically ) The bolt fell from a clear sky . She received no telegram , no letter to warn her of the impending destruction of her happiness . ( Places card on table . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Meaningly ) No , indeed . How could she ?</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . She was happy . She loved and was loved . ( SMITH turns and looks at her . ) And then in a second comes Fate with its cruel shears ——</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Interrupting her ) Excuse me , but do you write for the Sunday papers ?</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . No , but I have been listening lately to a great number of election speeches .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . I quite understand . From them those flowers of eloquence were culled . Please go on .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . Celia bore the blow with remarkable courage . But now comes your visit , which will upset her even more than the news of Colonel Smith 's death itself .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Yes , Miss Faraday , I am quite sure that it will do that . You have made an appeal to me to deliver my harrowing message as delicately as I can . You can help me not to make mistakes .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . How ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . By telling me where the lovers met , when they became engaged — and how it all happened .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . But you came with Colonel Smith 's card and words of recommendation written upon it by his failing hand . Did n't he tell you ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Well , you see , he was one of those great-hearted men who never speak about themselves . And towards the end , when he might have spoken , he was singularly comatose .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Sympathetically ) Poor fellow !</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Oh , it 's dreadful — dreadful ! I suppose your sister was very devoted to him ?</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . She adored him ! !</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Yes . That 's the part I understand best .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . But Celia 's engagement meant more to her than it would to most women .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Recoils slightly ) Why ?</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . It had somehow got into everybody 's head that Celia did n't — ( Looks around room ) — attract people . Poor old Celia . ( SMITH turns uneasily in chair . ) Of course , her engagement altered the whole position .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Oh , I begin to see .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . It was the night that I had just announced my engagement to Mr . Tarver .— Bobby was so witty about poor old Celia having to wear another pair of Green Stockings at my wedding ——</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Ah — h — Then there are other sisters ?</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . Yes , there 's Madge . She is between Celia and myself .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Engaged ?</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . More than engaged — married . And then comes Evelyn .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Married ?</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . Much more than married . ( SMITH stares . ) A widow .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . And Miss Celia is the eldest of you all ?</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . Oh , yes . Well , the moment after Celia was told of my engagement , she announced hers .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . To Colonel Smith . ( Turns away from her with sudden understanding . ) I see .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( More melodramatically ) You know she had met him at Southampton . ( SMITH looks at her . ) For a week they had been together . ( SMITH turns in his chair . ) Only that morning he had told her of his love . An hour later he was steaming down Southampton Water to leave his neglected bones on the arid wastes of a ——</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Interrupting her ) Ahem ! You 'll excuse me ——</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . I beg pardon . He was on his way to Somaliland . She wrote to him that night .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Slowly ) Yes , the letter reached him . ( Tapping his pocket ) I have it here .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Sentimentally ) He kept it ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Yes , he kept it . He used to sit and study it by the hour .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . How truly beautiful . Oh , you must tell Celia that . You must n't rob her of any of her grief .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . No , that would be too bad . So there was no opportunity for Smith to come and make your acquaintance ?</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . No , but I have heard so much of him from Celia that I could almost believe I see him . ( Stares dreamily at SMITH . SMITH rises slowly , a little disconcerted . PHYLLIS rising and moving R .) I 'll go and send Celia to you .</stage>
   <stage>( MARTIN enters through morning room . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Thanks . Now I know where I am .</stage>
   <stage>MARTIN . ( Stands up R .) Miss Faraday is coming down , Miss . ( Crosses and exits L ., lighting chandelier in card room . )</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . Very well , Martin . Then I 'll leave you to deliver your message alone . ( Crosses to door R. and opens it , then turns ) You have brought , I hope , one or two mementoes from him ——</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Puzzled for a moment ) I beg your pardon ?</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . Little things that Celia can treasure .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Oh , yes , yes . A few small things — trifles which Smith habitually wore .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Sentimentally ) Just what she will value most . ( Exits R. IE . )</stage>
   <stage>( SMITH chuckles . He looks at his ring , but can n't get it off , then at his knife . That wo n't do . Then at his cigarette case . That will not do . Also at his bunch of keys . That wo n't do . He reluctantly takes watch and chain from his waistcoat and looks about for something to wrap it up in . He sees the tissue paper which Celia has left on book slide , gets it and wraps watch and chain up in it , putting it in his pocket . He takes out his scarf pin , looks at it , starts to replace it in tie . He reconsiders and wraps that up too , putting it in his pocket . He hums a snatch of song for CELIA 'S entrance . CELIA enters in evening dress R. Comes R. C . SMITH does not look up . )</stage>

   <stage>CELIA . Colonel Vavasour . ( She speaks briskly , having no suspicion of his business . SMITH bows almost reverentially , sighs deeply . Looks as if about to speak , is silent . His head is bowed . Impatiently ) I am told that you wish to see me on important business .</stage>
   <stage>( SMITH nods head sadly . He looks up and , on seeing CELIA , starts with pleasurable surprise for a moment . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Upon important and lugubrious business .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Oh —? Do n't tell me there 's some new difficulty about Mr. Tarver 's election ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . I have come to speak to you about one who is dearer to you than all the world . ( CELIA is perplexed . ) As soon as I read the announcement in the “ Times ” this morning — I felt that I must come to you at once .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Pause ) The announcement !— in the “ Times ” ! ( She is startled . Stares at SMITH . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Of the death of Colonel Smith .</stage>
   <stage>( CELIA is amazed ; turns away quickly . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . You will forgive me , I am sure , Colonel Vavasour , but the news of my loss is so recent that you will understand my reluctance to discuss it with a stranger . ( She moves up toward morning room as though to exit . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Do n't go , please . ( CELIA turns back . ) It was your sister who took the card which introduces me . ( He takes up card from table L .) See !</stage>
   <stage>( CELIA advances L. of table R. and takes card . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . “ Colonel Smith . ” But there was n't any — I mean ( Sits in chair . ) Colonel Vavasour , I am a little overwhelmed .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Sympathetically ) I was afraid you would be .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Staring at card ) Colonel Smith !</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . I bring to you his last dying message .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . You — knew — him !</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Comes to her ) Turn that card over and read the last words written by his failing hand .</stage>
   <stage>( CELIA turns card over . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . “ Good-bye . ”</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Yes . ( Sniffs . Very sadly ) “ Good-bye . ”</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . “ Be kind to — my friend —— ”</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . “ James Nugent —— ”</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . “ Vavasour —— ”</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Col. Smith was my dearest friend . And knowing myself as I do , I can safely say that no one else will ever take his place in my affections .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . How extraordinary —— ( SMITH looks at her . ) I mean — how very unselfish of you .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Ah , yes . He compelled one 's love . I can appreciate possibly better than any one else how great must be your grief . ( CELIA agrees mournfully and regards him with ludicrous suspicion . Goes to table L. and sits L. of it ) Before coming here , I went to see his dear old people . He had never told them of his engagement , but he was always secretive .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Yes , very secretive .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . His dear little Aunt Mary was very fond of him .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Oh ! Little Aunt Mary !</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . And when I told her of your engagement , she was most anxious to meet you .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Yes , that would be very delightful — but not just yet , please — not just yet .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Not just yet , of course not just yet . But possibly when time has reconciled you to your loss . She expressed the hope that some day — but not just yet , of course , you and she might journey together to Somaliland with a wreath .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Yes . ( Choking and turning away her head . ) That 's a very sweet idea . We might go out for the Xmas holidays .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Oh , I know . I can gauge , Miss Faraday , the measure of your grief by my own . But there is just one alleviation which I am very glad to bring to you .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . What is that , please ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . When Colonel Smith died — of wounds — at Berbera , he died without any pain .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Rising , alarmed ) It is very good of you , Colonel Vavasour , to have come all the way from London to tell me this . ( Starts as if to exit , holding out her hand to SMITH . )</stage>
   <stage>( SMITH also rises , takes her hand and detains her C .)</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . This — and more . I was with him at the last . How well I remember the scene . He used to lie on his sick bed-gazing across the thatched roofs of Berbera to the Arab dhows riding at their anchors in the sea . ( She turns away R .) And he gave into my hands a few small things to bring you . ( CELIA turns away , horrified . ) Trifles which he habitually wore . Here are a few of them . ( Brings out packages containing watch and pin from pockets . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Heavens !! No !— I could n't think of taking them .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( In surprise , holding them towards CELIA ) They were Smith 's , and you could n't take them ! Ah , I understand . You had quarreled . ( Puts things into pockets . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . No , we never quarreled . There was never one harsh word spoken by me to him or by him to me .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( L. C . Standing ) Then why refuse his gifts ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Goes to table R. At a loss ) Well — you see — he had never given me anything .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Suddenly smiles and brings out parcels again ) How like Smith ! How very like him ! Even he had his failings . But we , who knew him so well , can afford to speak of them frankly .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . I do n't think you understand , Colonel Vavasour . Gifts would have been impossible in such an engagement as that which existed between him and me .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Severely ) Let Smith be the judge of that . ( Goes a step toward her ) Perhaps he is in this room now watching you refuse his gifts . ( CELIA moves R ., uneasily looking back over her shoulder . Sternly ) Watching you with the pain he did n't feel when he died of wounds at Berbera . ( He follows her and forces her to take the watch . She gingerly takes it and unwraps it , letting the watch fall out and hang by the chain , which she holds . It is a large , heavy gold watch of the “ turnip ” variety . ) His watch and chain . ( She lifts it up and down to show its weight . ) He bids you wear it always on your bosom . ( She recoils . Pleadingly ) To please Smith , whom we both loved . ( She looks helplessly about for a moment and then , in essaying to hang the watch about her neck , it slips and falls down inside her dress . They turn away from each other with varying emotions . Turning back ) By Jove ! I say that 's ripping of you .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . I beg your pardon , sir !</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Solemnly ) I am thanking you in my dead comrade 's name , my dearest friend . ( Bows his head . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Crossing him to L .) Oh , I did n't understand .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Unwraps second parcel and follows her across the stage ) With this , Smith pinned his tie — a curious jewel . He was very fond of it . I trust you will treasure it . ( CELIA tries to refuse pin , but SMITH forces it upon her . Goes through and empties all his pockets , offering cigarette case , knife , keys , etc . ) And here I have a few more things .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( With a gesture of horror , retreats up stage to card room ) No , no , no , no , please ! I do n't want them . I ——</stage>
   <stage>( TARVER enters through morning room in dinner jacket . He shows surprise at seeing SMITH . SMITH replaces articles in his pockets . )</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( At door R .) Oh , I am so sorry . I did n't know you were engaged . I think I left my election speech somewhere .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Eagerly coming down C .) That 's quite all right , Bobby . We have finished our business . Good-bye , Colonel Vavasour . It is extremely kind of you to have taken all this trouble for a stranger . ( Crosses down R. as though to exit . )</stage>
   <stage>( TARVER crosses to cabinet L. and gets his speech . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Follows CELIA to L. C . ) But I have n't delivered a single word of the message I am pledged to deliver .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Picks up speech and comes down L. of table to L. of SMITH ) I 'm just going .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Do n't let me drive you away , Mr .— Mr .—— ( Looks to CELIA to introduce him to TARVER . )</stage>
   <stage>( CELIA has turned and walked up stage . )</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . Oh , my name is Tarver .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . And mine is Nugent Vavasour . How do you do ? I am delighted to make your acquaintance . ( Shakes hands with him warmly . ) I have just met Miss Phyllis Faraday .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . Oh , have you ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Yes . I am just back from Somaliland .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . Are you ? I say ! I do n't suppose you could stay a little longer and help me with my election , could you ?</stage>
   <stage>( CELIA , in alarm , rushes to head of table and seizes railway guide . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Enthusiastically ) Of course I could , my dear fellow . Why did n't you mention it before ?</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . Well , I have n't waited very long .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Looking at railway guide ) Bobby , we could n't think of making such a demand upon Colonel Vavasour 's time .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . Well , it 's touch and go with me , you know .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . And I know a great deal about elections .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( To CELIA ) There !</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Yes . I was once on the Committee of a Club .</stage>
   <stage>( TARVER looks puzzled . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Looking at guide . Firmly ) There 's an excellent train leaving at eight-thirty . ( Lays down guide , pushes chair aside and walks down R. C . between chair and table . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . I shall be most happy if I can catch it , but I should be false to my friend if I went without delivering his last dying message .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . You can n't deliver it to-night , for Celia is going out to a dinner party .</stage>
   <stage>( CELIA gives BOBBY a swift , furious glance behind SMITH 'S back . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Shocked ) To a dinner party ?</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . Why , yes , and on to a concert afterwards .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( With great dignity ) It 's a classical concert . ( Pause . ) By the local Philharmonic Society , and Admiral Grice , with whom we are all dining , is the most important person in the constituency .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Sternly ) So you are all going out to enjoy yourselves .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Crossing R. and up stage ) Oh , they are . Phyllis and I for once are going to stay at home and dine quietly .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Turns toward TARVER and stops him at door ) But is it wise for you , Mr. Tarver , to stay at home at this very critical time ? I should have thought , knowing as much as I do about elections , that it was bad policy to offend so important a person as Admiral Grice .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( In doorway ) Oh , that 's all right . Celia can twist him around her little finger . He simply worships ——</stage>
   <stage>( CELIA , who has made a ball of the tissue paper on the table , throws it at BOBBY , who exits hurriedly without SMITH 'S seeing this . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Sternly . Going to her ) You never loved him .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Indignantly . Moving R .) Oh !</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . On the evening of the very day which brings you news of his decease , you are dressed to conquer and allure .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( More indignant ) Colonel Vavasour !</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . You know as well as I do how at all times Smith disapproved of a decollete gown . Born and brought up in a rigid and unbending family , he never quite emancipated himself from the principles of Calvinism . You know that ? ( He waits for her to answer . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Weakly . Sinks on stool at bottom of sofa ) Yes .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Looks at her ) And it 's not even black —! A dinner party with an amorous Admiral . After the dinner party , the wildest gaieties ! ( Goes L .)</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Do you call a classical concert by the local Philharmonic Society “ the wildest gaiety ” ? You never heard one .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Reproachfully . Coming back to CELIA ) You know what a low opinion Smith had of all forms of music . Dangerously sensuous . How often have I heard him breathe those words when the regimental band struck up the tune of “ Auld Lang Syne . ” ( She rises ; goes R .) You never loved him . Give me back the watch and chain .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Confused ) I can n't —— You utterly fail to understand the situation , Colonel Vavasour . All the help that any of us can give is needed at this election . To-night is particularly important . The two candidates are to meet on neutral ground .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Then certainly Mr. Tarver ought to go — not you .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . But I ask you , would Colonel Smith have wished me at a time like this to shut myself alone In my room with nothing but his memory for my companion ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . He 'd have loved it .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Entering through morning room in evening dress , carrying coat and hat ) Ready , Celia , ready ! ( CELIA and SMITH separate , SMITH going well L. FARADAY puts coat and hat on piano stool and comes down C .) Are n't the others down yet ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Father , this is Colonel Vavasour .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . How do you do ? ( They shake hands . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . How do you do ? I have just returned from Somaliland .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Oh ! Then you knew ——</stage>
   <stage>( SMITH nods ; drops his head . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . My dearest friend .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Poor fellow ! Poor fellow ! ( SMITH looks up . ) Oh , not for that reason — not for that reason , of course . ( LADY TRENCHARD , MADGE and PHYLLIS enter , in evening dress , followed by TARVER . ) My daughters , Colonel Vavasour . We are only waiting for your aunt now .</stage>
   <stage>( LADY TRENCHARD shakes hands gushingly , crosses to SMITH and sits R. of table L ., drawing on her gloves . MADGE merely bows as she crosses and joins EVELYN . PHYLLIS crosses , and joins them . SMITH goes R. C . FARADAY has gone L. at back and comes down stage L. of table L. TARVER goes directly and sits on fender . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Continuing ) Sorry we can n't keep you to dinner .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Sits on lower end of sofa ) That 's quite all right , Father . Colonel Vavasour is obliged to return to London to-night . There is an excellent train at eight-thirty .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Takes up railway guide which CELIA has left open on table and reads ) “ Stops at every station , has a two hours ’ wait at Bletchley , and arrives in London at three-thirty in the morning . ” ( Looks at CELIA ) An excellent train . The express goes at ten .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Then of course you 'll stay and dine here first . Martin shall look after you .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . I shall be most happy . ( At CELIA ) I have brought a message for Miss Faraday and I shall be unable to deliver it if she goes out to dinner .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Speaking over her shoulder ) Father , you know I promised you this afternoon that I should not let this news interfere ——</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . But , my dear child , thinking it over , we can n't expect such a sacrifice .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( In a whisper to MADGE ) But she must go . There 's only dinner for two .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Dinner for two ! What two ?</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Coming down R. to door ) Well , you see , I am worn to a shadow , and Phyllis and I thought ——</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Coming C .) Oh , you did ! Did you ? You get elected first , my lad , and think afterwards .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . Oh , I say !</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Phyllis and Tarver shall dine with Admiral Grice .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . But , Father ——</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Celia and Colonel Vavasour shall stay behind and eat their dinner .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . You do n't know how I need a rest .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Yes , Father , Bobby is very tired .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . As for myself , and I know a great deal about elections , I think it would be extremely prejudical if Mr. Tarver did n't go .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Then that settles it .</stage>
   <stage>( TARVER exits R. IE ., looking back belligerently at COLONEL VAVASOUR . EVELYN in dumb show tells PHYLLIS to get her wraps , and PHYLLIS flounces out through morning room . )</stage>
   <stage>MARTIN . ( Entering L. I and announcing ) Mr. Steele and Mr. Raleigh .</stage>
   <stage>( RALEIGH comes C. quickly to FARADAY . STEELE , shaking hands first with EVELYN , then stepping back and shaking hands with MADGE , speaks from L. of MADGE near door . )</stage>
   <stage>STEELE . How do you do , Mr. Faraday ?</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Good evening , boys .</stage>
   <stage>STEELE . We have both , I believed , arrived with the same idea . We are all going to the dinner party , are n't we ? I have my mother 's brougham and , since you are rather a large party — ( Looking across at CELIA ) — I thought I might be allowed to give some one a lift .</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . I have come in my own motor car , and since you are rather a large party — ( Also looking pointedly at CELIA ) — I thought I might be allowed to give some one a lift .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . It is very kind of you boys to think of us . We shall be a little bit squeezed . We are rather a large party , though Celia is not going .</stage>
   <stage>STEELE and RALEIGH . ( Disappointedly ) Not going ?</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . No . Colonel Smith is dead . ( STEELE and RALEIGH turn away and a slow smile breaks over their faces . ) This is Colonel Vavasour . ( STEELE and RALEIGH eye SMITH with interest . ) He knew Colonel Smith .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( L. of table R .) His dearest friend . I bring his last dying message . ( CELIA rises from sofa , glances at SMITH and goes up to doorway R .) He used to lie on his sickbed , gazing across the thatched roofs of Berbera to the Arab dhows riding at their anchors in the sea .</stage>
   <stage>( CELIA comes down R. of sofa . )</stage>
   <stage>STEELE . I am sure that must be very affecting , but it will be extremely bad for the cause if Miss Faraday stays at home to-night , and this is a time when it does n't do for any of us to be selfish . You 'll come , wo n't you , Miss Faraday ?</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY , ( C .) Certainly not .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( R. C . ) It would really be almost indecent to press Miss Faraday to go . ( SMITH and FARADAY turn up stage . )</stage>
   <stage>STEELE . ( Slightly piqued ) Oh , very well . Then as I can n't do anything for anyone , I suppose I had better be getting along . ( Exits L. IE . and leaves door open . )</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . How that fellow Steele does give himself away . Silly ass ! ( Goes R. to CELIA . ) I must say , Miss Faraday , that I think you are absolutely right to stay away from the Admiral 's . The way that old man dogs your footsteps is positively revolting , but — ( With insinuating smile , kneeling on stool below sofa . Fatuously ) — but you might come on to the Philharmonic Concert afterwards . Do n't you think so ? ( Laughs idiotically . ) Do n't you think so ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Shaking her head sadly ) Not to-night , Mr. Raleigh . Not to-night . ( Exits R. IE . )</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . Oh , very well . It 's about time for me to be getting along . ( Crosses quickly to door L .) I shall see you all at the Admiral 's , ( Exits quickly , closing door . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . God bless my soul ! I thought he came to give some of us a lift .</stage>
   <stage>MADGE and EVELYN . Why , yes .</stage>
   <stage>( AUNT IDA enters quickly through morning room and comes down R. C ., looking about her . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Gayly ) Hope I am not last .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Well , you are .</stage>
   <stage>( PHYLLIS and TARVER enter , TARVER in evening dress with his hat and overcoat and atlas . PHYLLIS with her wraps . TARVER goes to head of table R. and studies his atlas . PHYLLIS sits on fender . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Looking about and fastening her gloves ) Well , Celia is not down yet .</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . Celia is n't coming .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . What !</stage>
   <stage>( SMITH comes down stage to L. of AUNT IDA . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Coming down L. C . with SMITH ) Ida , this is Colonel Vavasour . My sister-in-law , Mrs. Chisholm Faraday . ( To SMITH ) Who has been , I may say , more than a mother to our poor Celia through all this , more than a mother .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . I am delighted to make your acquaintance . ( Shakes her warmly by the hand . ) Friends of Miss Faraday have a claim upon me which can never be obliterated from my mind .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Briskly ) I am sure it is very pleasant to know that . But why ?</stage>
   <stage>( SMITH C ., AUNT IDA to his right . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Colonel Vavasour has just returned from Somaliland .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( In horror ) What ! !</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . From Somaliland .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Involuntarily ) But why did he do that ?</stage>
   <stage>( SMITH looks at FARADAY . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Eh ?— I do n't think you understand , Ida . Colonel Vavasour is here — I may say — on an errand of mercy . He brings us news of our poor — gallant — lost friend — Smith .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . S-S-Smith —?</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Colonel Smith .</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . Celia 's Colonel Smith .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Coming C. at back with atlas , beckoning to FARADAY , who joins him , and together they look over the atlas , FARADAY explaining something to TARVER ) Colonel Vavasour knew him quite well .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( In awestruck voice ) You — knew — the — Co — Co — Colonel ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . My dearest friend . I bring to Miss Faraday a few trinkets he habitually wore and his last dying message .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Wildly . Stands rigidly , staring at SMITH ) Trinkets !! A message !! ( During the following speech , AUNT IDA gradually becomes more and more hysterical , culminating in a series of wild shrieks of hysterical laughter and grotesque movements of her arms and body . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . A long message . He used to lie in his sickbed , gazing across the thatched roofs of Berbera to the Arab dhows , riding at their anchors in the sea , and ——</stage>
   <stage>( AUNT IDA , by now , is shrieking wildly and waving her arms above . MADGE runs frightened across the L. of AUNT IDA and PHYLLIS runs down from fender to R. of AUNT IDA , and together they help her into chair to L. of table R. TARVER and FARADAY look up suddenly , startled . SMITH goes up L. C ., concealing laughter . PHYLLIS stands R. of chair below sofa , trying to hold AUNT IDA 'S hand . EVELYN runs excitedly and aimlessly about , looking for smelling salts . FARADAY runs up and down extreme L ., waving his arms . MADGE above chair , fanning AUNT IDA . TARVER C ., fanning AUNT IDA with atlas . He kneels and fans her more vigorously . They all talk excitedly to each other , such as , “ What has happened to your Aunt Ida ? ” “ God bless my soul , can n't you do something for your aunt ? ” “ She is having a fit , ” “ Go for a doctor , ” “ Fan her , fan her , ” “ Get some water , ” etc ., etc . During all this , AUNT IDA is still shrieking . )</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( At a signal from AUNT IDA ) The shock has been too much for her .</stage>
   <stage>MADGE . She 's so devoted to Celia .</stage>
   <stage>( AUNT IDA whoops . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Get some vinegar .</stage>
   <stage>( AUNT IDA whoops . )</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . No , smelling salts .</stage>
   <stage>( AUNT IDA whoops . )</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Rising ) Oh , hold it upside down !</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Nonsense , that 's for drowning .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . Here , I know a remedy .</stage>
   <stage>( MADGE takes TARVER 'S place at L. of choir and TARVER goes up above chair , gets spray from table , leans over AUNT IDA 'S shoulder and sprays her forehead . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Comes down C .) Slap her hands hard . That always brings them to .</stage>
   <stage>( PHYLLIS and MADGE slap AUNT IDA 'S hands vigorously . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Pushing them away ) It does n't do anything of the kind .</stage>
   <stage>( MADGE goes L. C . and helps EVELYN on with evening wraps . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . There , what did I tell you ? ( Goes up stage and to table L .)</stage>
   <stage>( TARVER goes R. above sofa . PHYLLIS goes R. between sofa and fender . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Rises weakly ) Oh — oh — oh — oh — oh — oh ! This must be broken to Celia .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Going up and getting his coat and hat from piano stool ) Celia already knows .</stage>
   <stage>PHYLLIS . ( Pouting ) She and Colonel Vavasour are going to stay home and dine together . ( Goes up to TARVER and talks . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Gasping ) Dine together !! And discuss S-S-Smith !! ( CELIA enters in mourning — black shawl and dress — door R. I. She closes door , comes a few steps on stage and stands with folded hands and downcast eyes . AUNT IDA is now thoroughly bewildered . ) Celia , you 're in black ! ( Waves her hand up and down weakly . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Yes , dear . I made a mistake when I said I should n't allow this news to interfere . I was wrong . Colonel Vavasour has shown me how deeply he was grieved by my neglect of the trappings of distress .</stage>
   <stage>( NOTE : The bodice of the black dress CELIA wears , which is completely hidden by the black shawl , should be of some bright color , to be disclosed in Act III . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( With a long wail ) Will somebody pinch me , please ? ( Sits . )</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Coming to foot of sofa and kneeling ) Let me do it for you , wo n't you ?</stage>
   <stage>( MARTIN enters through L. I with army list on tray . Comes to FARADAY . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Certainly not .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Rising and going back to head of sofa ) So sorry .</stage>
   <stage>MARTIN . The wagonette is at the door , sir .</stage>
   <stage>( EVELYN and MADGE cross to door L ., bidding goodnight to COLONEL SMITH , and exit . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Very well , what have you got there , Martin ?</stage>
   <stage>MARTIN . Another army list , sir .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Above table L. C . Seeing army list ) Oh , damn !</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . All right . Put it on the table . ( MARTIN puts army list on table , crosses R. and exits through morning room , turning on lights in morning room . ) Now then , off we go . ( Counting ) One , two , three , four . ( To PHYLLIS and TARVER ) No hanging behind , you two . ( TARVER and PHYLLIS cross quickly L. to door . ) Got your atlas , Tarver ?</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . Yes , sir .</stage>
   <stage>( PHYLLIS and TARVER exit , nodding good-night to COLONEL SMITH . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Then off we go . ( Coming down to AUNT IDA 'S chair , helping her up and supporting her . AUNT IDA , who is now in a thoroughly demoralised condition , weakly and brokenly emits little gasps . The feathers in her hair have fallen over one eye . She also shows other traces of her recent fit . FARADAY lifts her up , puts his arm around her waist and leads her across the stage , FARADAY above her . CELIA follows her as far as chair R. of table L ., where she remains . ) Come along , Ida . This has been a little too much for you . Nothing like fresh air for an attack like yours . You will be all right when you get out in the fresh air . ( AUNT IDA crosses with him quickly , but haltingly , still emitting little gasps . When she gets almost to the door , she looks back at CELIA 'S dress , and with a final burst , exits . FARADAY at door ) My daughter will appreciate these quiet , I may say , these holy hours — with you , Colonel Vavasour .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Comes down L. C . ) I appreciate them , sir .</stage>
   <stage>( FARADAY exits L. IE ., closing door after him . MARTIN enters through morning room . )</stage>
   <stage>MARTIN . Dinner is served . Miss . ( Exits through morning room . )</stage>
   <stage>( Clock off L ., upper , chimes eight . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Eight !</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . And your train goes at ten .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Yes . We shall have two long hours to talk of Smith . ( Offers CELIA his arm . CELIA takes it and they go slowly up to morning room . )</stage>
   <p>QUICK CURTAIN</p>
   <p>ACT III</p>
   <stage>SCENE : It is two hours later in the morning room . At center back are large recess double doors with muslin curtains on lower half and chintz curtains on upper half . When the doors are opened , a portion of the room of the preceding acts can be seen . Directly at back is seen the table , on which stands the book slide containing the army list . The table runs across stage . Behind and to the R. of this and against the back drop is seen the cabinet of the preceding act . Directly behind table is a chair . The fire glow comes from the R. The back drop should be that portion of the L. wall of the preceding set , showing large picture hung as before . At the left of the set proper , reaching from the floor almost to the ceiling , a semicircular conservatory window , curves out into the room . In this are palms and flowers , with a greenery backing . Recessed into L. first flat is a china closet , containing china and bric-a-brac . Balancing this in R. I is a door leading to the hall . Balancing the conservatory is a large recessed window , muslin curtains on the lower sash and chintz curtains on the upper . Damask hangings over window and also over doors C. All of these hangings are looped back . In the window is set a window box containing flowers . In the center of the window is a small sewing table . Below it and facing it , a winged armchair ; above it and facing it , another small armchair . On the table are a lamp and some flowers . Against back flat and to left of window is a small serving table , on which are an empty silver serving tray , a small tray and a small decanter of brandy and two liquor glasses on it . To left of double doors is a chair . R. of conservatory , a chintz-covered stool . Below conservatory , a three-winged , chintz-covered screen . Below this and about three feet from L. flat is a desk , running up and down stage ; the lower end being slightly more on stage . On this , on the extreme upper end , is a telephone . Also on the desk are inkwell , pens , paper and envelopes . On the elevated portion of the upper end is a lamp . Below desk , a waste paper basket . In the center of the stage and well down is a small , round dinner table , with cloth . On the table are a cigarette box , a cigarette lighter ( burning ) , two ashtrays , plates , doilies and finger-bowls containing water , fruit knives and forks , a nut-cracker , and an almond dish . Directly in the center of the table is a fruit basket , containing apples , grapes and peaches . One peach should be easily accessible , it being used by COLONEL SMITH . At the upper end of table are two shaded , lighted candles , between these a vase with flowers . At CELIA 'S place to the R. is a claret glass , stained at the bottom to represent a residue of wine . At SMITH 'S place are a clean claret glass and a high-ball glass , containing a small quantity of whiskey and soda . On either side of the table are chairs . On the back flat , to each side of the doors , are candle brackets . Before curtain rises , the clock off stage ( same as used in previous act ) chimes ten . Curtain rises on the first stroke , after the usual Westminster prelude . Dinner is over . The lamps are lit and doors at back closed . CELIA sits to R. of table , dipping her fingers in finger-bowl . She is in the black dress and shawl of the preceding act . SMITH is to the left . He is intent upon explaining something to CELIA , and she is listening with most apparent interest . At rise of curtain .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Continuing his description ) It was the usual sort of formation when a small force gets caught in the open — a square with the maxims at the corners . We had only two ,— one — here — at the tip of the nut-crackers , and the other here — at the end of the knife-handle . ( He has made a square with dessert knives and nut-crackers on the tablecloth . To illustrate the position of the maxims he uses nuts . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Only two !</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . We should have liked some more , of course . But we 'd have gotten along all right if this fellow here — ( Touching one of the nuts ) — had n't jammed .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Oh ! What happened then ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . The Somalis at the corner charged . From here , from here , from here , others swept round and flung themselves upon the back of their companions . Imagine a huge wedge and an enormous hammer pounding behind it . They split our ranks in a second . It was a surprise that took you by the throat . You heard the maxim talking to ‘ em like a father , and , by George , there they were in the hollow of the square , stabbing at our backs .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( With much admiration ) Oh — and where were you ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( In square ) Here .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . There ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Yes . ( He takes a peach . ) That 's me . ( Places it in the square . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Ah ! There ! You were there ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Oh , I was all right . We faced the rear ranks about and drove ‘ em out of it . It was messy . You see , we could only use the bayonet inside the square . In a little while we got the maxim going again and made ‘ em respectful . However , they hung around us and we could n't move along very fast . That was our trouble . For we had to move along , we were short of water and a day 's march from the wells .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Oh !</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . So , you see , it was necessary that as soon as night came , someone should get through and bring relief .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( With much appreciation ) I know what happened . I know !— You volunteered ——</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Looks at her ; his eyes accept her homage and thank her . He laughs happily ) Yes . Between you and me — it was safer outside the square .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Reproachfully ) Oh —!</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Well — I was n't in command . So I could volunteer .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . And got the D. S. O. in consequence .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . And a drink a day before the others . I 'll get a step , too , I think .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Then you 'll be general , wo n't you ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Brigadier ——</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Smiling at him admiringly ) You can n't know what it means to a woman who has lived always in a little out-of-the-way place like this , where only the same ordinary things happen day after day , to hear of wonderful deeds like these — from a man who 's done them ! ( Speaks earnestly , without gushing . )</stage>
   <stage>( SMITH beams ; moves his chair slightly towards her . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Oh , yes . We are getting along together capitally , are n't we ? And you can n't know how all this — ( Moves his hand to include the room ) — appeals to a man who finds the skirmish and the camp a bit of an old story , and realizes that this — the quiet , well-ordered household — the home — and the home-maker — is after all what is really worth fighting for .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Leans forward , listening ) But — surely you have a home ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . I have a house —— By Jove ! Now I have two houses !</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Interested ) You have just bought another place ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Inherited it . An old Abbey about the size of Trafalgar Square on a wet day — and not as cheerful .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . But you must n't let yourself be lonely . You ought to marry .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Moves his chair closer to CELIA ) That 's what I begin to think .</stage>
   <stage>( MARTIN enters R. with tray . On it , two small cups , small sugar bowl and a coffee pot , also one cigarette for CELIA . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Seeing MARTIN ) Wo n't you have a cigarette ? ( Offering SMITH cigarette box . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Takes cigarette and moves back ) Thank you .</stage>
   <stage>MARTIN . ( Placing coffee on the table ) Coffee , Miss .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Sugar ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Thanks , yes .</stage>
   <stage>MARTIN . ( Has taken up CELIA 'S plate and finger-bowl in right hand and now takes SMITH 'S plate and finger-bow . ) Old brandy , sir ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Old brandy ! By George , yes ! ( Lights cigarette . )</stage>
   <stage>( MARTIN goes up to small serving table R. of door and puts plates and finger-bowls on tray and gets brandy tray which he brings down to table and pours out one glass , leaving brandy on table . He takes the napkins , goes up , puts them on tray with other things and exits with tray R. I .)</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( While MARTIN is serving ) I asked Martin to serve coffee here , because I thought it would be cosier , you know . ( Having poured SMITH 'S coffee , she passes cup to him . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Taking cup slowly from her ) Much — much cosier ; though , for both of us to-night — ( CELIA fills her cup ) — our one idea of cosiness must be the grave .</stage>
   <stage>( CELIA drops pot on tray . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Leans forward , takes cigarette from coffee tray and lights it ) The grave ! Then , tell me of it , wo n't you ? Where does it lie ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Openly perplexed , sees CELIA smoking and attempts to use this as a means of extricating himself . Pretending to be shocked ) Oh ! the grave ! oh ——</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . What 's the matter ? ( Puffs her cigarette . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Shrugging his shoulders ) Oh , nothing , nothing .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Do you object to women smoking ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . I ? Not at all . It 's companionable , but Smith — ( CELIA chokes on cigarette ) — would Smith have liked to see you smoking a cigarette ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Annoyed , pauses ) Perhaps not — to-night .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Not to-night and not any night . ( CELIA viciously presses cigarette down on ashtray and puts it out . Reprovingly ) We both know how strongly he disapproved of the modern latitude of women 's manners . ( She turns away . ) You know I 'd fancy the man who could make you care for him would be quite different from Smith . You have n't his little shut-in way of looking at life . You have such a splendid imagination .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Nervously ) Yes , and I 'm beginning to think I need one .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Did you really love each other ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Takes up her coffee cup ) I can n't answer for Colonel Smith — who was a man you know . But for myself , I can truthfully say that I have thought of him every day for eight months . Thought of him —— Yes ! And written to him too .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Startled ) Written to him ! By Jove , then ! Where are those letters ? You can n't let things like that go astray . Letters from you — knocking loose about a camp ! ( He is upset and disturbed . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Smiling to herself ) Why should you imagine — my letters never reached him ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Smiling reminiscently ) Because I was with him — when he got the first one .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Very agitated . Puts her cup sharply on saucer ) You — you — you do n't mean to say a Colonel Smith ever received —— Oh — no gentleman could have shown my letter .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Sincerely ) Shown it ? Oh , Miss Faraday , you can n't know what that letter of yours meant to ——</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Turning on him quickly ) I beg your pardon .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . I mean did meant — I mean did mean — to good old Smith . ( Leaning forward with a smile . Moves his chair below table a little closer to hers . ) I say , I 've an idea . Let 's forget Smith for five minutes and talk of something else .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Forgetting herself ) Oh , yes ! Do let 's .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . What shall we talk about ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Very engagingly ) You . You have hardly said a word yet about yourself — and — naturally I am interested . ( Speaks with a smile . Face on L . hand . )</stage>
   <stage>( SMITH edges toward her , delighted R. elbow on table , face on hand . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . I was born — guess when ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Thirty years ago .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Holding out box ) Have a cigarette ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . No , thank you . I 'd rather not . Do you think Smith would have liked me to smoke ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Ah , you see , we can n't get away from him . He dominates us . Living or dead , his imperious nature will not be neglected . He sits at the table here between you and me . ( Designates a spot between them on table . ) To satisfy him , we 've got to talk about him .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . What is there to say ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . What is there to say ! And you 've told me nothing about the Smith you knew .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Surprised ) The Smith I knew ? ( Recovering herself ) Oh , yes , of course .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Yes — you see I know him only as the soldier — the man of action — the fighting man — but you ——</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . But there is nothing to tell .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Strongly ) You mean there is nothing you wish to tell .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Defiantly ) Certainly not . What is it you wish to know ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Let us compare our pictures — mental , of course — of the man . ( With solicitude . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Oh , no — not at all . Not at all .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Then you describe Smith as you saw him , and I 'll tell you if I agree with you .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Of course , you know our descriptions wo n't be alike . No two people 's description of anyone ever would be .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Of course not — except in the definite facts .— His eyes , for instance ——</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . His eyes — his eyes were not definite .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Not definite ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Their color . I mean it varied . Emotion kindled them — apathy dulled them . Sometimes they were light and again they were very , very dark .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . That 's funny . I never saw them dark . To me they always were light , like bottle glass .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Really ? Possibly you were not very observing .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Acknowledges the point with a touch of impatience ) Possibly not . But his hair ? Surely we can n't differ as to that ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . His hair — you mean did it curl or was it straight ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Yes — and its color .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . His hair — I hardly know how to describe his hair , because his hair was —— It was like no hair that I ever saw .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Laughs ) That 's a splendid description of a bald man . That always was a great grief to Smith , his baldness ; his head was so very bald and bumpy .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Oh , yes .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Puts his hand to his head ) What ! ( Recovering himself ) Oh , yes , yes . ( Growing more and more determined to trip her and more and more interested in and appreciative of her attractiveness ) Now his mouth ——</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Well . His mouth was peculiar ——</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Peculiar ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Yes , you see it broadened when he smiled .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Laughing ) Oh — did he smile for you ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Oh , often , very often .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Yes , we all do — do n't we ? What would you say of his voice ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . It was kind , always kind .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Shakes head ) Gruff and commanding .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Insinuatingly ) Naturally — not to me . ( Her hand rests on the table . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Slowly covering her hand with his ) No , no-how could it be ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Looking over their hands to the spot that SMITH had indicated earlier ) Do you feel he 's sitting there still ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Leaning toward her ) You 're surely not afraid of — Wobbles ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Pushes chair back , sliding with it as far up stage as possible . Faintly ) Did you say — Wobbles ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Briskly ) You surely knew his nickname ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Openly perplexed ) But I — I called him — Wobbles . ( Stares at SMITH . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Why ! All the Army called him — Wobbles .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( In dry , queer voice ) I did n't know that .</stage>
   <stage>( READY Third Border . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . He was the most popular fellow —! You wo n't go to a dance or a garden party for the rest of your life — there wo n't be a town in the United Kingdom , Miss Faraday , where you wo n't meet somebody , some old school-fellow , some brother-officer , who knew him :— who will understand your loss and tell you new details of Wobbles . ( Rises . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Rises and comes down stage ) Not if I know it ! ( SMITH stares at her . Returning , getting her chair and replacing it at table ) Colonel Vavasour — I mean it will be quite impossible for me — to indulge myself in any such fashion . Because just as soon as possible , I 'm sailing for America .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Dropping below table ) America ? Why , Smith has — four brothers ranching there . And five — I mean three — sisters-in-law . I congratulate you , Miss Faraday . ( Offers CELIA his hand . CELIA takes it limply and he shakes it . ) You are going to the very heart of poor Wobbles ’ family . Sha n't I cable them to meet you at the dock ? ( They are both now in front of table . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Withdrawing her hand ) No — no — no — no , please do n't do anything like that .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Why not ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Well , I do n't know , but I — I might get off the ship before it reaches New York . At all events I am going where no one can ever find me .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Quickly , but quite seriously ) Then — by Jove — I 'm going there too . ( Takes her left hand tenderly and leans forward . They look straight into each other 's eyes for a moment . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Draws herself up ) Are n't you forgetting yourself , Colonel Vavasour ? ( With an irresistible impulse of mischief ) Or are you only forgetting Wobbles ? ( Crosses C. to table . Looking back at spot on table . )</stage>
   <stage>( THIRD Border Full Up . )</stage>
   <stage>( A gay chatter is heard off L. of party returning from concert . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Not hearing it ) Oh , damn Wobbles . ( Crosses L .) I 'm going because —— ( The center doors open quickly . GRICE , STEELE , FARADAY , TARVER and PHYLLIS , EVELYN , RALEIGH and AUNT IDA are in the doorway , having come from the left . Conscious of the presence of returning party , SMITH reverts to his tone of solemnity and CELIA bows her head with grief . FARADAY , in doorway , hearing SMITH , turns and raises his hands to quiet the party . GRICE and AUNT IDA have drifted down L. ahead of the others . AUNT IDA sinks wearily into chair by desk . ) Hour by hour , he lay on his sick bed , looking out across the — thatched roofs of Berbera to the Arab —— ( GRICE sneezes loudly . Turning ) Good Lord , what 's that ! ( The others come down in the following order : STEELE , RALEIGH and EVELYN come down R .; PHYLLIS and TARVER up C .; FARADAY to R. of CELIA ; MADGE by AUNT IDA 'S chair . GRICE has gone down L. C . Some of the party are carrying programs . The doors are left open . ) In the midst of our sad communings , how strangely out of place are these revelers .</stage>
   <stage>OMNES . Revelers ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . They come flushed with new wine .</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . New wine ? They dined with me , sir .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Turning to FARADAY ) Was the concert a success ?</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Of course it was . We were there . ( Goes up stage . )</stage>
   <stage>GRICE . ( Plaintively ) We missed you , Celia .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Miss Faraday could n't go without hearing Colonel Smith 's last message .</stage>
   <stage>( AUNT IDA laughs hysterically . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Crossing to AUNT IDA . Sternly ) Not again , Ida , not again .</stage>
   <stage>( AUNT IDA relapses into a state of semi-oblivion . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . It 's not nearly ended yet .</stage>
   <stage>STEELE . Well , she has had over two hours to hear it in .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Scornfully ) Two hours ? It was a long message . He lay for weeks on his sickbed gazing across the thatched roofs of Berbera to — watching ——</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . Oh , yes , watching the Arab cows feeding at their anchors .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Dhows , man , dhows !</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . Well , dhows or cows , I do n't care . And as for Smith , I tell you , I am fed with the fellow .</stage>

   <stage>STEELE . ( Thinking CELIA is crying ) You brute ! You — you blundering idiot !</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Coming down R. of CELIA ) Even now he 's dead , he 's kept you from the concert to-night . My agent told me that we just should n't do it . He expects I will lose by a hundred votes .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . How 's that ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Looking up quickly ) Oh , no , Bobby , it 's not too late . We 'll help you . ( Rises and crosses to SMITH , who is R .)</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . I am at your service , Miss Faraday .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( To SMITH , eagerly ) And you 're some good — are n't you ? ( Goes up to PHYLLIS , back C .)</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . We may call on you later , Vavasour .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Do . Do .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Taking ADMIRAL by the arm and going ) Come along , Admiral . Come and have a cigar and we 'll talk it over . ( Spoken off stage R .) Smith or no Smith , we must win this seat .</stage>
   <stage>TARVER . ( Taking PHYLLIS ’ arm ) Madge — Evelyn . Let 's go and count the names of the hundred beasts who wo n't vote for me .</stage>
   <stage>( PHYLLIS and TARVER and MADGE move to door C. and exit R .)</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . ( Who has moved up to door , turns in door . Coquettishly to STEELE and RALEIGH ) I 'm afraid I can n't count — without some big , strong man to help me .</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . ( Looking round ) Ask Steele . He took all the ‘ rithmetic prizes at his kindergarten .</stage>
   <stage>STEELE . ( Looking round ) I 'll come in one minute , Lady Trenchard . There 's something on my program I must show to Miss Faraday . ( Indicating program . )</stage>
   <stage>EVELYN . ( At door ) Well —! When Celia has quite done with all of you —— ( Exit rapidly . )</stage>
   <stage>( Clock chimes half hour . A moment after EVELYN has gone off , she presumably switches off lights in room off C .— then third border is put out and no light except glow from fire remains . The doors remain wide open . )</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . Half past ten ! I thought Colonel Vavasour 's train left at ten , Miss Faraday .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Confused ) Oh , did it ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Coolly ) Well , did n't it ? And in any case , Mr. Faraday 's clock is wrong .</stage>
   <stage>STEELE . ( Taking out his watch ) Wrong ? Not a bit of it .</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . ( Also takes out his watch ) I make it ten thirty-two . ( Ironically ) Perhaps your watch will correct me , Colonel Vavasour .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Crosses R. C . Absent-mindedly feels for his watch and starts as he realizes his mistake . CELIA sees this and the true situation flashes on her . She swings up stage for a moment to cover her shock and embarrassment and then returns and faces SMITH , as she leans against the chair L. of table . RALEIGH and STEELE have turned to each other and are discussing the situation , for the moment ignoring CELIA and SMITH . As CELIA faces SMITH , he flounders through his explanation ) Well , you see , I — I — I — I — I left my watch in town to be cleaned . It ran too fast .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Sarcastically ) Like the inventive genius of its owner , perhaps , and your scarf pin ; no doubt , you 've taken advantage of this period of mourning to have all your jewelry attended to . ( Turns away R .)</stage>

   <stage>SMITH . Miss Faraday , please ——</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Turning back ) Colonel Vavasour , I think you said your name was . You will allow me , wo n't you , to lend you the watch you so kindly brought from poor Colonel Smith . Otherwise , you know , you might be a very long time without your own , and since your grief must now be lessened , by having shared it with me , perhaps you might be induced to mitigate your mourning and wear his pin . Do let me send them to you . And I 'll include a little nursery fable which perhaps you know , called , “ The Tortoise and the Hare , ” because I think — I 've caught up . Now , I 'll say good-night to you , Colonel Vavasour , and good-bye .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Seriously ) Good-bye ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Moving to C. and speaking to RALEIGH ) There is a midnight train to town ?</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . Oh , yes .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( To SMITH ) I 'm quite sure that Mr. Steele and Mr. Raleigh will be happy to drop you at the station on their way home .</stage>
   <stage>STEELE . Delighted !</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( To RALEIGH , shaking hands ) So sorry to hurry you away .</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . Oh , I shall see you to-morrow , Miss Faraday .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Yes , do . ( Nods good-night to STEELE . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Who is still at desk , her head resting wearily on her hands . Sleepily ) Everybody going ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Crosses L .) Yes , dear , Colonel Vavasour is . ( Crosses to AUNT IDA . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Is there nothing left unsaid ? Is there nothing left for me to say but good-bye ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Over her shoulder ) Nothing .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Bows . Speaks in a brisk , matter-of-fact way , as he crosses C. D . ) Well , since you two fellows are kind enough to offer me a lift . ( Exits , followed by RALEIGH and STEELE , who go off , chatting ad lib . and closing door . )</stage>

   <stage>CELIA . ( Tearing off her black shawl , waving it in the air , and throwing herself in the chair L. of table , her back to the audience , disclosing her gay and decollete bodice ) Oh — h-h-h-h ! Oh — h-h-h-h ! Oh — h-h-h-h ! Oh — h-h-h-h !</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Going to CELIA ) Celia , what have you been up to now ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Oh , when I think of it , Aunt Ida ! “ The Arab dhows riding at their anchors , ” and how I told him —— Oh , Heavens — how I told him he ought to marry . Oh — h-h-h-h ! Oh — h-h-h-h !</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Celia Faraday ! ( Goes up to her and catches her by both shoulders ) Are you mad ? I vow I 've a great mind to shake you .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . I wish you would , Aunt Ida . I wish you would . ( Looking toward door R .) I do n't believe it . I do n't believe it . I do n't believe what I do believe . For Heaven 's sake , dear , go and fetch me the army list , so that I may make sure of what an awful fool I 've been , and if what I believe is true , let me sit like this in the dark . ( Goes up and presses switch and sits in chair L. of door . Lights out . ) — All the rest of my life and blush and blush and blush until my cheeks drop off from blushing .</stage>
   <stage>( AUNT IDA comes L. of CELIA 'S chair . There is only the moonlight now in the morning room , with a shaft of moonlight shining through window R. on CELIA . The library , seen through the wide open doors , is lit up by the glow from the fire . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Are you mad ? ( Starts to exit to get army list . Sees SMITH and draws away R .) Hush — sh-sh-sh !</stage>
   <stage>( SMITH in an ulster is seen to cross cautiously at back to table . He lights two or three matches at once and looks through book-slide for army list . Finding this , he takes it and smiles in a satisfied manner , and holding the match to the list , moves off stage R. CELIA and AUNT IDA peer after him . A flicker is seen on the walls and furniture of the room off stage , as of the book burning . After a pause , CELIA rises and stands C. in doorway , facing audience . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . The army list !</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Now he 's thrown the army list into the fire . ( Ready motor horn . ) Celia — has Colonel Vavasour gone mad too ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . So ! He thinks he can prevent my finding out , does he ? That I can n't be absolutely sure until to-morrow ? Well ( Rushes off R .)</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Perhaps we are all mad — mad as hatters . ( Goes R. and presses light switch . )</stage>
   <stage>( LIGHTS Up . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Off stage ) Army lists do n't burn as suddenly as that , I know . ( At door ) I have burned too many of them . ( Reappears , carrying the partly burned army list in tongs . She comes in blowing at the burning book ) Blow , Aunt Ida , blow ! ( AUNT IDA joins her . They both blow to put out the sparks . ) Only the A 's are burnt , Aunt Ida , only the A 's . ( Goes down L. of table , drops book on table , and hands the tongs to AUNT IDA . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Waving the tongs ) Only the A 's ! Ha ! Ha ! Only the A 's !</stage>
   <stage>( Motor horn is heard off R. 3 . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . What 's that , Aunt Ida , what 's that ?</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . It 's Mr. Raleigh 's motor .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( With an outburst of relief ) Well , then , he 's gone , is n't he , he 's gone .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Yes , he 's gone , he 's gone !</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Picks up book and runs through it ) V-V-V-V-V — Vallance — Valpey — Vanderfeldt — Varley — not a Vavasour .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Celia !</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Throwing down book ) Not one in the whole army list . No ? Not the tiniest little bit of a one .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Flourishing tongs more wildly ) Then who is he ? What did he come here for ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . I do n't know , but he 's gone now , is n't he ? He 's gone !</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . I know he 's gone , but what did he come here for ? ( CELIA looks at her . A light breaks over her . ) Celia Faraday ! That man — had your letter — in his pocket . He told Phyllis he had your letter ! I thought it strange ! Then Colonel Vavasour is n't Colonel Vavasour . ( Sits R. of C . table . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . No !</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . He 's Colonel Smith .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Yes .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . He 's ——</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( In the smallest possible voice ) — Mr. Wobbles ! ( Enter FARADAY R. IE . ) Father , dear , has Colonel Vavasour gone ?</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . No , my dear .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . What !!! !</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . I was fortunate enough to catch him at the door .</stage>
   <stage>( AUNT IDA drops tongs on floor beside her R .)</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . But , Father , what ever possessed you to ask him to stay ? ( Crosses L . Sits . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . You know he offered to help us . Things are looking pretty black for Tarver . We need all the help we can get at this mass meeting in the morning . So I have persuaded Colonel Vavasour to stop over and take the noon train .</stage>
   <stage>( FARADAY turns toward door R. I and proudly ushers in SMITH . CELIA and AUNT IDA turn their heads away , much discomfited . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Taking SMITH by the arm and passing him across him ) A room must be prepared at once . Has Mrs. Brown gone to bed yet ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Still seated L. of table . Haughtily ) I do n't know , Father . She frequently goes to bed .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Eh ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Confused ) I mean , early .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( As SMITH goes C .) Good-for-nothing old person , that housekeeper . Come with me . I 'll look out for you myself . ( They walk toward door C .) We 'll be back presently , Celia , to say goodnight to you and your aunt . ( They exit C. door to L. Off stage ) Tell Martin to bring in whiskey and soda .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( After a pause ) Did you hear that , Aunt Ida ?</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Wearily ) Uh-huh .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . “ Stay here for the night and then take the noon train . ” That 's our train , Aunt Ida — the noon train . Is n't this an awful situation ? Now , what are we going to do ?</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Still more wearily ) I do n't know .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . I can n't face that man again , after — I can n't . I have got to get out of this house myself , to-night , some way , somehow . ( Rushes up to C. doors , closing and locking them . ) How can I manage it ? Think , Aunt Ida . Think — think — think — think — think .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Disgustedly ) Think — think — think — think — think . I can n't think . My poor old head wo n't stand much more of this .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Coming down back of AUNT IDA and putting her arms about her ) I 've got it . Since he 's going to take our train , there 's nothing left for us to do but take his .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Startled ) What ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Yes , that midnight train . I do n't care where it goes or if it ever gets there . We 'll manage to reach Southampton somehow before to-morrow night . The thing is to get away from here as quickly as possible . We must hurry terribly . It 's nearly eleven now . We can have a compartment to ourselves . I 'll see if Wilson is still at the station . ( Crossing to telephone on desk ) He 'll tell us all about it .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Protesting ) I 'm only half packed .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . That does n't matter . I 'm not packed at all . Kent 's a jewel . She will stay up all night , packing everything , and follow us in the morning . ( Rings telephone and lifts off receiver ) Hello ! Are you there ?</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Still protesting ) My tailor suit has gone to the cleaner 's and wo n't be home till morning . I 've nothing to wear .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . There is no time to wear anything . We must go without any clothes .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . What ! !</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Except motor coats , I mean . We 've got to go as we are . ( Into telephone ) Hello ! Yes , put me through to the station , quick , please . I want to speak to Wilson . ( To AUNT IDA ) Now , do n't worry , Aunt Ida , I will bundle you up warmly .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . I 'll have to have something to eat . I have had nothing since morning . I could n't eat a bite at the dinner and I feel so gone and faint .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Well , if you 're feeling faint , dear , take a drink of that brandy . That 'll do you good .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Oh , no . I 'm not addicted to the use of those things .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . But , if you 're faint , you need it . ( Into the telephone ) Hello ! Hello ! Is that you , Wilson ?</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . But I do feel very faint .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Just a minute , Wilson . ( Puts down receiver and runs across to brandy bottle , picks up bottle and pours it into whiskey and soda glass , while she talks excitedly . She pours the glass half full . ) Now , please , dear . Do n't be ridiculous at a time like this . You might have one of your dreadful fainting spells in the motor , and I should n't know what to do for you . Now , come , come , dear , drink this . ( Rushes to the back of AUNT IDA 'S chair and holds the glass while she drinks . AUNT IDA drains the glass , making a wry face and shuddering . CELIA hurriedly puts down glass and flies back to telephone . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . If only it does n't go to my head !</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Oh , it wo n't , it wo n't . ( Into telephone ) Hello , Wilson , are you there ? Well , listen , this is Miss Faraday . Yes , yes , Miss Celia . I 've got to get away to-night on the midnight train . It 's most important and will you look up at once what connections that train makes for Southampton — yes , Southampton . Also please wire Bletchley , and have a compartment reserved for me . What ? It will take you ten minutes ? Please hurry . There is so little time to spare . ( Replaces receiver . ) Now we must get the motor . ( Springs up from chair and goes up to bell-push L. of C. door , rings bell , runs down to R. of AUNT IDA and picks up the tongs from floor . ) How do you feel now , Aunt Ida ? How do you feel now ?</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Oh , I feel all right .</stage>
   <stage>( Enter MARTIN R. I . He stands . )</stage>
   <stage>MARTIN . Yes , Miss .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Holding tongs ) Oh , Martin , I want you to jump upstairs ——</stage>
   <stage>MARTIN . ( In open amazement ) Jump , Miss ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . I said , “ Jump ” and tell Kent to give you two motor coats and any other kind of a wrap she can find , two motor bonnets , some veils and furs and some pins and my motor bag and — two toothbrushes . We are going for a drive .</stage>
   <stage>MARTIN . A drive , Miss ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Irritated ) I said a drive . Will you hurry , please ?</stage>
   <stage>( READY Telephone . )</stage>
   <stage>MARTIN . Very good , Miss . ( Exit R. I .)</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . We can n't have the motor . We could n't have it to go to the Admiral 's . It 's broken .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Putting tongs in the winged armchair ) It would n't be a motor if it was n't . Now what will we do ? Oh , I 'll get Jimmie Raleigh and he 'll come back and take us down in his . ( Goes to phone . ) Hello ! Hello ! I wonder what the — ( AUNT IDA squeals ) — telephone number is . Oh , Aunt Ida , please do be quiet . You know you will make me nervous in a minute .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . I 'm not saying a word .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Hello ! Hello ! Give me Sir William Raleigh 's house , please . Yes , I know the family is away , but I want to speak to Mr. James Raleigh . ( Stuffs handkerchief in telephone receiver and turns to AUNT IDA . ) Aunt Ida , tell me , do you know , are there any Smiths ranching in Chicago ?</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Slightly tipsily ) Smiths ? Smiths ? I do n't know .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Into telephone ) What ? He 's not in ? ( MARTIN enters with wraps and bags . Crosses back of table to chair L. of table . ) Well , have him ring me up directly he comes in — Miss Faraday . Yes , please . ( Puts up telephone . Jumps up , goes to MARTIN , helps him place wraps on chair , takes bag and puts it on floor , beside and to the L. of chair R .)</stage>
   <stage>( NOTE : The wraps must be placed across MARTIN 'S arms in the following manner : CELIA 'S wrap on bottom , then her veil and bonnet . Next comes muff and fur for AUNT IDA . Then the ulster for AUNT IDA and on top her bonnet . The bag is in MARTIN 'S hand . )</stage>
   <stage>MARTIN . ( Going C. above table ) Sha n't I clear the table , Miss ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . No , leave it till morning . Do n't bother about anything . Go to bed , Martin , go to bed . Good-night .</stage>
   <stage>MARTIN . Thank you , Miss . Good-night . ( Goes L. and exits . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . You have forgotten the whiskey and soda .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Seizes AUNT IDA 'S bonnet from pile of wraps and crosses to her above table ) Of course I have . You do n't suppose I 'm going to have those two men back here until we 're out of the way . ( Placing bonnet on AUNT IDA 'S head from back ) I do n't want to hurry you , dear , but we must be ready the minute Mr. Raleigh gets here . ( CELIA is so excited that she gets AUNT IDA 'S bonnet on quite to one side , ties a rampant bow under her right ear , then flies up stage and peeps through curtain on door to see if the men are returning . AUNT IDA during this is showing serious signs of the effect of the brandy by grotesque gestures and movements of her head . CELIA returns R. of AUNT IDA . ) How do you feel now , Aunt Ida , how do you feel now ?</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Quite tipsily ) I never felt like this before in all my life . I think I 've got a chill .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . A chill ? Do you want a little more brandy ? ( Goes for decanter . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . No — no — no — no .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Seizing ulster and going back to her ) Then get into this . It will keep you warm while you are waiting . ( She helps AUNT IDA , who is still seated , into the ulster , her right arm first . She then rushes back to chair for fur and muff . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . ( Flopping on table ) Oh , Celia ! Why do we have to go on this dreadful journey ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Handing her muff over her shoulder , which AUNT IDA clutches and hugs like a child ) To get to Chicago , dear , to get to Chicago ! ( Placing stole around her neck ) And we 'll be there almost before you realize it . ( Telephone bell rings . CELIA throws stole quickly around AUNT IDA 'S face , almost smothering her , and rushes to telephone . ) Hello !— Hello !— What ?— Yes , Mr. Raleigh . I did — Mr. Raleigh , Aunt Ida has just had a cable from Chicago with some very bad news .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Oh ! Oh !</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( To AUNT IDA ) Hush ! ( Into telephone ) And she has got to get away to-night on the midnight train . I want to go a little way with her . Wo n't you come and drive us to the station in your motor ?— What ? You will ? Oh , that 's very kind of you , but do n't drive up to the door . ( AUNT IDA rises , supporting herself on table . ) No , stay down by the gate and we 'll walk down . ( AUNT IDA has moved cautiously around and walks over to the conservatory window . ) Just blow your horn gently when you get here , so we 'll know that you 've arrived . We 'll go down as quickly as we can . Yes .— Thanks .— Yes , yes . ( Hangs up receiver and goes for her bonnet . Crosses below table to door R .) How do you feel now , Aunt Ida ? How do you feel now ?</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . I 'm afraid it 's a fever , or else I 'm dreadfully over-heated . ( Sits on stool . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Going to her ) You 'll be all right , once you 're in the fresh air . But I 've got to leave you for a few moments while I run upstairs and get my box of love letters . I can n't go away and leave those things behind me . There are about two hundred and fifty of them by this time . ( Going R .) I 've been writing to that man every day for eight months .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Celia ! ( CELIA stops . Beckons to her tipsily . CELIA goes to her . ) Do you know something , Celia . I believe you 're half in love with Smith .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Going back R .) You dear old goose , you do n't know what you 're talking about . I half in love with that man ? Half in love with a man who has treated me as that man has done ? Well — ( Going further R .) — I hope I 'm not quite such a fool as that , Aunt Ida .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Oh , oh , oh , oh !</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( With her back to AUNT IDA ) Well , and if I were ? Is n't it all the more reason for me to get out of this house before I make a bigger fool of myself ? ( Goes to door R ., which she barely opens when AUNT IDA stops her again . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Celia !!! ( CELIA turns . ) I believe — I ought to lie down .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Lets the door slam to and rushes straight across the stage to AUNT IDA ) No , Aunt Ida , dear , you can n't do anything like that . You can sleep in the motor and in the train , but you must stay here while I 'm gone and listen for Wilson 's telephone message and write it down .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . It 's no use . Just five minutes . I must lie down .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . I wo n't be a minute .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Now I 'm getting cold . Put something around me .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Well , here . ( Puts screen in front of her ) This will keep off the draught and you can have the fresh air at the same time , and have a little nap while you 're waiting . ( Speaking over , her shoulder , she goes R. to door ) No one will disturb you , dear . I 've locked that door and will take the key of this one with me , and I 'll hurry back as fast as I can , Aunt Ida , just as fast as —— ( Exits quickly , locking door behind her . )</stage>
   <stage>( There is a pause . The faint toot of a motor horn is heard off L. AUNT IDA 'S hands are seen to grasp the top of the outer wings of the screen , one by one . Her head appears for a moment . She looks about tipsily and then drops suddenly out of sight again . After a pause , a second toot is heard . AUNT IDA rises slowly and carefully and comes out R. of screen . She is extremely puzzled . )</stage>
   <stage>AUNT IDA . Now what was that ? ( Her eye lights on telephone and a smile breaks over her face ) The telephone . Wilson 's message . Must write it down . ( Goes carefully and slowly to desk and sits heavily in chair . Takes off receiver and places transmitter to her ear . There is a pause as she listens . A look of terror and surprise creeps over her face . ) Now ! something 's the matter with my ears . I can n't hear a word they say . I believe I 'm paralyzed . Oh , dear . ( Looks helplessly about her . ) Why does n't Celia come back ? ( She has taken a pen in her right hand to write down the message . She holds the receiver in her left hand . She looks from one to the other and cannot make up her mind which goes where . She finally decides and elaborately puts the pen in the telephone hooks with a satisfied smile . She then carefully places the receiver on the desk where the pen ought to be . ) It 's not us . This has been a dreadful day . ( Slowly and carefully rising and looking tipsily about ) If I 'm to be good for anything to-night , I will have to lie down somewhere . ( Goes up to doors ) If only for five minutes . ( Unlocks and opens doors ) I 'll have to lie down — I 'll — have — to —— ( She exits at back to R ., whimpering to herself . When she is off , the telephone bell begins to ring . After it has rung for a moment , FARADAY is heard off stage , calling )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Off stage L .) Celia ! Celia ! Where are you , Celia ? ( He appears from the L. and stands in C. doorway , looking off right . His jaw drops . ) What — is — the — matter — with — your — Aunt ? ( The telephone bell continues to ring . He hurries down . ) Here ! Stop it ! Stop it ! Stop it ! ( SMITH enters and comes down L. of table above chair where CELIA 'S coat and bag are . FARADAY sees pen in telephone hooks , jerks it out and throws it on desk and picks up receiver . Bell stops ringing . ) Hello ! Hello ! Faraday Hall . Mr. Faraday speaking .— Tell Miss Faraday what ? You 've made the reservation on the midnight train , change cars at Cobden ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Sees CELIA 'S wraps and bag and starts slightly ) Miss Faraday going ? ( Moves R. above table , thinking . )</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . ( Into telephone ) Nonsense , man , you mean Mrs. Faraday . At twelve noon , she 's leaving , not twelve midnight .— What 's that you say ? It was Miss Celia that telephoned and said she was going herself ? Nonsense , man ! Do n't argue with me . I 'm afraid you 've been drinking , my man . ( Smells telephone ) The telephone reeks of brandy ! Try to be sober by morning . Remember , we need you in this election . ( As he hangs up telephone ) I 've only known him to be drunk once before — decent chap and devoted to Celia .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( R. of table ) Every one is , sir . She 's peculiarly attractive .</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Yes , but it 's taken people a long time to find it out . Now , where has Martin put that whiskey ? ( He goes fussing about the room ) But the men who want to step into Smith 's shoes now are legion . ( Still looking about and fussing . Picks up brandy decanter . Smells it and puts it down . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . It 's a legion , sir , I 'd like to enlist in at once . Have I your permission ?</stage>
   <stage>FARADAY . Of course you have , my dear fellow , of course you have ! ( Crossing R .) If I can only find that damn whiskey and soda , I will drink good luck to you . ( Rattles door down R. Finds it locked ) What do you suppose that scoundrel Martin has been up to ? Has everybody been drinking to-night ? Come , we 'll have to go around through the library . ( Goes up to C. door and exits R. SMITH follows him . As SMITH gets to door , the motor horn toots twice . He pauses and looks back , knowingly , then exits off R. After his exit , horn toots twice . )</stage>
   <stage>( Enter CELIA with box supposed to contain love letters and small box supposed to contain watch and pin . She closes the door and deliberately disregards open doors at back . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Keeping her eyes fixed on her box of letters , crosses C. below table ) I 'm back , Aunty dear . I was n't very long , was I ? I 've got my box of love letters . ( Holds out box and looks at it ruefully ) Well , they will go into the furnace with my own hands . ( Places box right of her on table . ) And his watch and his pin , infamous things , he 'll have those back and a letter with them , that I hope will burn without going into the furnace . ( CELIA goes to desk and takes up a piece of paper as if to write ) Tell me , dear . Did Wilson telephone ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Who has appeared at back from R .) Yes , Miss Faraday , he did . ( CELIA drops the paper from her hand , turns slowly around , sees open doors , walks deliberately to screen and looks over it , her back to the audience . She turns around , her face expressing chagrin and annoyance at AUNT IDA 'S failing her . ) May n't I come into the room and speak to you ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Certainly not . ( Goes and viciously seizes her coat from chair and begins to put it on . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Coming into the room just the same and coming down above her on the R .) You told me , I know , there was nothing more to say but good-bye and I 'll say that too , if I must . But first , there is something else to say and I 'd much rather say it than write it .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Mo , whatever you do , do n't write — do n't write me anything . I dislike letters intensely and just at present they seem to be a drug on the market . ( Picks up her bag and veil . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . But there is something I must say to you before you go .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . How do you know I 'm going anywhere ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Looks down at her bag and smiles ) Well ? ( CELIA swings bag to other side of her . ) Besides , I overheard Wilson 's message .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Oh , you did . Well , then perhaps you will be good enough to realize that I 'm in something of a hurry . You will find your jewelry there on the desk .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Wo n't you sit down for five minutes ?</stage>
   <stage>( READY Horn . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Certainly not .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Just five !</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . No .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . If you do n't , upon my word , I shall begin to believe that you are afraid of me .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Sits quickly with her back to the audience L. of table ) Indeed ! That would n't be your first mistake , you know .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . I know it was a foolish trick . I had no right to come here as I did .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . It was a cruel joke .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Simply and feelingly ) Yes , but a joke that is more on me now than it ever was on you . ( Motor horn toots three times . CELIA turns her head in the direction of the conservatory . ) I want you to know that my name really is Vavasour .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . You astonish me . Is n't it anything else too ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Yes , it 's really J. N. Smith , too .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Oh ! Is that all ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . No , more . Now that I have come in to my Uncle Vavasour 's old Abbey , I have to take his name legally , Smith-Vavasour , do n't you see ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . I see . What a delightful combination of class and mass ! This may be all very interesting to anyone interested , but really I have n't time now to split hairs over a middle name . Your intention was to deceive me , and you almost succeeded . Failure alone , I take it , accounts for your present humility . Now , if you will be good enough to get your watch on the desk , you will see that the five minutes you asked for are up and , since you insist on saying good-bye to me , will you say it as quickly as possible , please , and let me go ? ( Makes no attempt to move . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . No . Not until we 've decided what 's to be done about your other letters . ( Hand unconsciously rests on the box of letters without his knowing it . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Glances at this and tries to appear unconcerned ) What other letters ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . I have that first one here . ( Pressing his hand over his heart . ) But — all the others . Good God ! ( Moving well down R .) When I think of love letters of yours wandering loose about Somaliland —— ( CELIA places her bag quickly on table , steals her arm across , seizes the box of letters while SMITH is not looking , and on the word Somaliland , swings away from him , hiding the box awkwardly under her cloak . ) There 's one thing I can do to show you what I feel about it . Give me some clue to the mistaken addresses you must have put upon them and I 'll start back to-morrow and fetch them . ( Comes L. C ., quite close to CELIA . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . From Somaliland ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . From Hell , if necessary .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Fortunately , such a journey would be superfluous .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . What do you mean ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . I mean that all of those hundreds and hundreds of letters that I was fool enough to write to an imaginary hero are all here in this box . And now they 're going into the furnace with my own hands . ( Starts for door , swinging the box in her right hand . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Following her and playfully taking the box from her ) Wo n't you give them to me instead ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Turns back and they both hold on to box ) Certainly not . It 's an additional insult that you should even suggest such a thing . Do you suppose I ever want to see you or hear your name again — a man who has dared to hold me up to ridicule as you have done — to wickedly and cruelly amuse himself at my expense —— ( SMITH gives a low laugh . ) Oh , do n't you suppose I know how funny I must have seemed to you ? Ha ! Ha ! ( Imitates SMITH 'S laugh . ) Silly idiot of a girl , tired of having no notice taken of her , tired of being kept on the shelf , just dying to show people how attractive she could be — only give her the chance . And to think because of that I made such an everlasting fool of myself before a man , a man who is capable of ——</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Capable of telling you a lie , Miss Faraday ? ( Puts box of letters on table . )</stage>
   <stage>( READY Motor Horn . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Well , you did . You know you did . You did everything you could think of to deceive me .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . I can n't deny it .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . And do you believe that a man or a woman could ever bring himself or herself to respect or have anything to do with a man or a woman who — who deceived ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . I do believe it . And judging by my own case , I may say I know it .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . I do n't think it is very generous of you to allude to me in that manner .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Me . We are discussing me , Miss Faraday . What can I say to induce you to forgive me ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Nothing . ( SMITH turns away . She glances at him . In an indifferent tone ) But , of course , you may say it if you wish .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Turns and comes to her . Tenderly ) I did lie to you elaborately , and I 'm going to be jolly glad that I had the chance of lying to you , and I want all the rest of my life the chance of telling you the truth . These few hours with you have made me want so very much for more like them , made me want a chance to seem less odious in your eyes , at least to be on a fair footing , so that I may take my chances with the rest .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Looking straight into his eyes ) But they have n't any chance at all .</stage>
   <stage>( SMITH laughs a little and CELIA , realizing her “ break ” turns her head away in confusion . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Well , that 's good news . Then give me a chance alone , wo n't you ? You 've only known me for four hours , but am I wrong in believing that you 've been thinking of me for eight months ? Ca n't I hope to take the place of the man to whom you gave my name ?</stage>
   <stage>( CELIA smiles and looks down a little wistfully , as if about to consent . Motor horn toots three times . )</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Throwing off her yielding mood , turns and goes to the winged armchair , back to audience , shaking out her veil and pointing L .) Oh , no , it 's all too impossible . Besides , Mr. Raleigh is waiting for me in the motor .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Comes to her and gently takes her right hand ) You 've been dreaming for eight months of an ideal that you never thought to see . I 've been dreaming all my life in exactly the same way and at last I 've seen mine .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( After a pause , during which she lets her hand rest in his , her head averted ) Yes , but it 's too late now , because I 'm leaving here immediately . Mr. Raleigh is waiting to take me to the station . ( SMITH pulls her gently across and down stage a few steps . She goes quite willingly . ) Will you please let me go ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( Still holding her hands ) You shall go . I shall let you go . The instant you tell me to whom you are speaking — Celia .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Really , this is an outrage . Will you kindly let me go , Colonel Smith ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . He can n't . You remember you killed him of wounds at Berbera .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Well , Colonel Vavasour , will you please let me go ?</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . He can n't . The lawyers have n't finished making him .</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( After a pause , while she slowly breaks into a laugh ) Oh , very well , then — Wobbles .</stage>
   <stage>( SMITH releases her hand and she hurries to door R. and opens it . )</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . Please do n't go . Come into the next room and talk things over .</stage>
   <stage>( Auto horn toots impatiently off R .)</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . No , no , I can n't . There 's Mr. Raleigh . He 's come up to the door . Good-bye .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( After a pause ) Good-bye ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . Yes , good-bye . ( Goes to door and looks off down stairs ) Why , here he is coming up the steps . Martin 's letting him in . ( SMITH turns and goes slowly up stage to C. Putting on her veil ) No wonder he 's impatient . He 's been waiting for me for twenty minutes .</stage>
   <stage>SMITH . ( In doorway ) Yes , but remember I 've been waiting for you for twenty years . ( Exits , off L. C . )</stage>
   <stage>( WARN Curtain . )</stage>
   <stage>( CELIA pauses a moment and then crosses up as if to call him back , looking over her shoulder to see that RALEIGH is not coming . She goes off stage C. and looks after SMITH and then with a sigh , comes back into room , goes to L. of table , tying her veil as she comes down . RALEIGH enters . He 's very cold . His nose is red , his coat collar turned up and he is chattering . Comes to R. C . a little up stage . )</stage>
   <stage>RALEIGH . Miss Faraday , I had to come in . I 'm nearly frozen — you 'll miss your train . I 've been waiting for you for twenty minutes . ( He offers her his arm . CELIA picks up her bag , crosses to him , takes his arm and they walk quickly to the door . He is above her . He smiles contentedly as they start to exit . As they get to the door , she swings him right out and turns back , going up and off C. again , looking after SMITH . RALEIGH returns and stands by door ) Are n't you coming ?</stage>
   <stage>CELIA . ( Comes down to him and , as she reaches winged chair , she suddenly drops her bag in the seat of it and throws back her head with a joyous laugh ) No , I 've changed my mind . I 'm going to stay , because he 's been waiting for me for twenty years . ( Runs gaily up and off after SMITH , waving her hand to RALEIGH as she goes . RALEIGH drops his hat in amazement , with a smothered , “ Well , I 'll be —— ” )</stage>
