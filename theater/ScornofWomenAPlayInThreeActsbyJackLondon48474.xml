   <stage>Dog-punchers , couriers , miners , Indians , mounted police , clerks , etc .</stage>
   <stage>FREDA MOLOOF . A Greek girl and a dancer . Speaks perfect English , but withal has that slight , indefinable foreign touch of accent . Good figure , willowy , yet not too slender . Of indeterminate age , possibly no more than twenty-five . Her furs the most magnificent in all the Yukon country from Chilcoot to St. Michael 's , her name common on the lips of men .</stage>
   <stage>FLOYD VANDERLIP . An Eldorado king , worth a couple of millions . Simple , elemental , almost childish in his emotions . But a brave man , and masculine ; a man who has done a man 's work in the world . Has caressed more shovel-handles than women 's hands . Big-muscled , big-bodied , ingenuous-faced ; the sort of a man whom women of the right sort can tie into knots .</stage>
   <stage>LORAINE LISZNAYI . A Hungarian , reputed to be wealthy , and to be travelling in the Klondike for pleasure and love of adventure . Past the flush of youth , and with fair success feigning youth . In the first stages of putting flesh upon her erstwhile plumpness . Dark-eyed , a flashing , dazzling brunette , with a cosmopolitan reputation earned in a day when she posed in the studios of artist-queens and received at her door the cards of cardinals and princes .</stage>
   <stage>CAPTAIN EPPINGWELL . Special agent for the United States government .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. EPPINGWELL . His wife . Twenty-five to twenty-eight years of age . Of the cold order of women , possessing sanity , and restraint , and control . Brown hair , demi-blond type , oval-faced , with cameo-like features . The kind of a woman who is not painfully good , but who acts upon principle and who knows always just what she is doing .</stage>
   <stage>FLOSSIE . Eighteen or nineteen years of age . Of the soft and clinging kind , with pretty , pouting lips , blow-away hair , and eyes full of the merry shallows of life . Engaged to marry Floyd Vanderlip .</stage>
   <stage>PRINCE . A young mining engineer . A good fellow , a man 's man .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. MCFEE . Near to forty , Scotch accent , sharp-featured , and unbeautiful , with an eager nose that leads her into the affairs of others . So painfully good that it hurts .</stage>
   <stage>SITKA CHARLEY . An Indian dog-puncher , who has come into the warm and sat by the fires of the white man until he is somewhat as one of them . Should not be much shorter than Vanderlip and Captain Eppingwell .</stage>
   <stage>DAVE HARNEY . An Eldorado king , also a Yankee , with a fondness for sugar and a faculty for sharp dealing . Is tall , lean , loose-jointed . Walks with a shambling gait . Speaks slowly , with a drawl .</stage>
   <stage>MINNIE . ( Maid to Freda . ) A cool , impassive young woman .</stage>
   <stage>POLICEMAN . A young fellow , with small blond mustache . An Englishman , brave , cool , but easily embarrassed . Though he says “ Sorry ” frequently , he is never for an instant afraid .</stage>

    <head type="act">ACT I — ALASKA COMPANY 'S STORE AT DAWSON</head>
    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>Scene . Alaska Commercial Company 's store at Dawson . It is eleven o'clock of a cold winter morning . In front , on the left , a very large wood-burning stove . Beside the stove is a woodbox filled with firewood . Farther back , on left , a door with sign on it , “ Private . ” On right , door , a street entrance ; alongside are wisp-brooms for brushing snow from moccasins . In the background a long counter running full length of room with just space at either end for ingress or egress . Large gold-scales rest upon counter . Behind counter equally long rows of shelves , broken in two places by ordinary small-paned house-windows . Windows are source of a dim , gray light . Doors , window-frames , and sashes are of rough , unstained pine boards . Shelves practically empty , with here and there upon them an article of hardware ( such as pots , pans , and tea-kettles ) , or of dry-goods ( such as pasteboard boxes and bolts of cloth ) . The walls of the store are of logs stuffed between with brown moss . On counter , furs , moccasins , mittens , and blankets , piled up or spread out for inspection . In front of counter many snow-shoes , picks , shovels , axes , gold-pans , axe-handles , and oblong sheet-iron Yukon stoves . The feature most notable is the absence of foodstuffs in any considerable quantity . On shelves a few tins of mushrooms , a few bottles of olives .</stage>
     <stage>About the stove , backs to the stove and hands behind their backs , clad in mackinaw suits , mittens dangling from around their necks at ends of leather thongs , ear-flaps of fur caps raised , are several miners . Prince stands by stove An Indian is replenishing the fire with great chunks of wood . Mounted police pass in and out . Sitka Charley is examining snow-shoes , bending and testing them . Behind the counter are several clerks , one of whom is waiting upon a bearded miner near end of counter to right .</stage>

     <speaker>No sugar ?</speaker>
     <p>CLERK<stage>Coming from behind counter and approaching stove , visibly irritated , shaking his head violently ; midway he encounters Miner , who retreats backward before him .</stage>No ! No ! No ! I tell you no ! No flour , no beans , no sugar , nothing !<stage>Warms his hands over stove and glares ferociously at Miner .</stage><stage>Dave Harney enters from right , brushes snow from moccasins , and walks across to stove . He is tall and lean , has a loose-jointed , shambling gait , and listens interestedly to Clerk and Miner . He evinces a desire to speak , but his mustached mouth is so iced-up that he cannot open it . He bends over stove to thaw the ice .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MINER</speaker>
     <p><stage>To Clerk , with growing anger .</stage>It 's all very well for your playing the high an ’ lofty , you sneakin ’ little counter-jumper . But we all know what your damned Company is up to . You 're holdin ’ grub for a rise , that 's what you 're doin ’ . Famine prices is your game .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MINER</speaker>
     <p>I suppose you 'll say they 're empty .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLERK</speaker>
     <p>They 're not . But what little grub 's in them belongs to the sour-doughs who filed their orders last spring and summer before ever you thought of coming into the country . And even the sourdoughs are scaled down , cut clean in half . Now shut up . I do n't want to hear any more from you . You newcomers need n't think you 're going to run this country , because you ai n't .<stage>Turning his hack on Miner .</stage>Damned cheechawker !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MINER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Breaking down and showing fear , not of Clerk , but of famine .</stage>But good heavens , man , what am I to do ? I have n't fifty pounds of flour for the whole winter . I can pay for my grub if you 'll sell it to me . You can n't leave me starve !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVE HARNEY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Tearing the last chunk oj ice from mustache and sending it rattling to the floor . He speaks with a drawl .</stage>Aw , you tenderfeet make me tired . I never seen the beat of you critters . Better men than you have starved in this country , an ’ they did n't make no bones about it neither — they was all bones I calkilate . What do you think this is ? A Sunday picnic ? Jes ’ come in , eh ? An ’ you 're clean scairt . Look at me — old-timer , sir , a sour-dough , an ’ proud of it ! I come into this country before there was any blamed Company , fished for my breakfast , an ’ hunted my supper . An ’ when the fish did n't bite an ’ they wa'n ' t any game , jes ’ cinched my belt tighter an ’ hiked along , livin ’ on salmon-bellies and rabbit tracks an ’ eatin ’ my moccasins .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Jubilantly . ) Oh , I tell you this is the country that 'll take the saleratus out of you ! ( Miner , awed by being face to face with an old-timer , withers up during harangue , and at finish shrinks behind other miners , and from there makes exit to right . ) ( Drawing paper from pocket and presenting it . ) Now lookee here , Mister Clerk , what 'd you call that ?</stage>

     <p>I can n't help the gladness getting into my face , Loraine .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LORAINE</speaker>
     <p>Do n't call me Loraine . Somebody might hear . And we can n't be too careful . And you must n't talk but for a moment , Floyd .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VANDERLIP</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Grinning broadly .</stage>
      <l>There you go , calling me Floyd . Somebody might hear . But who 's afraid ?</l>
      <l>I 'm not . Let ‘ em hear . I 'm glad of it ! Proud of it that you 're mine .</l>
      <l>The dearest little woman in the world , and mine , all mine !</l>

     <speaker>LORAINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Glancing furtively about and finding that nobody is paying any attention .</stage>Hush , dear . Wait until we are safely away , and then I shall be proud before all the world to have you proud of me . You are such a man ! Such a man !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VANDERLIP</speaker>
     <p>Just wait until I get you into that Mediterranean palace . We 'll make ‘ em sit up with this Klondike gold of ours . People do n't know how rich I am , Loraine . Nor do you . I 've got pay-claims over on Dominion Creek nobody dreams of , and —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LORAINE</speaker>
     <p>I do n't care how much you 've got , or how little . It 's you , you big , big man , you , my hero , that I care for . You 'll grace a palace like a prince , and I 've known a few princes , too .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VANDERLIP</speaker>
     <p>And queens , too , did n't you say ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LORAINE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , and queens , too . And they will be proud and glad to know you . They do n't have men like you over there — real men . You 'll create a sensation .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VANDERLIP</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Anxiously .</stage>
      <l>But this living in palaces — sort of softening and fattening , ai n't it ?</l>
      <l>I do n't like fat .</l>
      <stage>Looks her over critically .</stage>
      <l>You do n't incline that way , do you ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LORAINE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Laughing .</stage>
      <l>You foolish , dear man , of course not . Do I look it ?</l>
     </lg>

    <sp>
     <speaker>VANDERLIP</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Slowly .</stage>
      <l>Well , you look round — and plump .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LORAINE</speaker>
     <p>I 've always been plump like this . I 'm like my mother . She was that way . She never got stout , and neither shall I .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VANDERLIP</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Anxiety going out of face , being replaced by satisfaction .</stage>
      <l>Oh , you 're all right , Loraine , you bet .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LORAINE</speaker>
     <p>But you must leave me now , Floyd . Somebody may come in at any moment . Besides , I 've a few little things to buy for our journey .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>And they 're fixing my money for me in there .<stage>Nodding toward door at lejt . Loraine betrays keen and involuntary interest</stage>Letters of credit , you know , and all that .

     <speaker>VANDERLIP</speaker>
     <p>A woman needs so almighty much to be comfortable . But it 'll be all right . Two sleds 'll carry us , no matter how comfortable you make yourself . Bring plenty of foot-gear , moccasins , and stockings , and such things . And be at the water-hole at midnight with your whole outfit . Be sure that Indian of yours has enough dog food . I 'll get my dogs to-day some time .</p>

     <speaker>LORAINE</speaker>
     <p>Which water-hole ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LORAINE</speaker>
     <p>And now you simply must leave me . And you must n't see me again to-day — not till midnight , at the water-hole , by the hospital . You know I can scarcely bear to have you out of my sight . But these women — oh , they are such suspicious creatures !</p>

I speak my mind , and it 's ay shameful that honest bodies must be so sore put . There 'll be ruffians and gamblers with masks over their sinful faces , and who 's to know ? And there 's that Freda woman . ‘ Tis said she plays with the souls of men as a child with a wee bit of a pipe plays with soap-bubbles .

EPPINGWELL The Ever-Victorious-One beaten ! Impossible ! I 'll not believe it . MRS. EPPINGWELL I am , just the same . Here I have been trying to save Floyd Vanderlip , counteracting that evil woman 's influence , having him to tea and dinner and giving him no end of my time , and Flossie is n't here yet , and he runs away with Freda Mo-loof to-night . It 's all arranged , and everything . CAPT . EPPINGWELL But — but — wait a minute . Enlighten me . I am only a poor traveller . Who is this Flossie ? And why should n't this Vanderlip-man — whoever he is — run away if he wants to ? MRS. EPPINGWELL How ridiculous of me ! I forget you 've been away . You know who Freda Moloof is ? CAPT . EPPINGWELL Surely , surely . She has the most magnificent furs and the most magnificent dogs in all Alaska . A fascinating creature , I — er — understand .

    <sp>
     <speaker>O-o-h !</speaker>
     <p>MRS. EPPINGWELL Floyd Vanderlip is a big , strong man . For five years he chased Eldorados over the ice-fields , living on moose and salmon and working like a beast . He never had an idle moment in which to be wicked . Then he struck it on Klondike and is worth millions and millions . Also , he sat down for the first time in five years and rested . He remembered a girl who was waiting for him down in the States — a young thing — and sent for her to come in . They were to be married as soon as she arrived . He has a cabin all ready . Well , that 's Flossie . She is coming in over the ice now — he 's told me all about it — and ought to be here any day . I 've been looking for her , and looking for her , till I am almost sick . Then this Freda Moloof cast her spell upon him . I heard the gossip — CAPT . EPPINGWELL And proceeded to take a hand . I begin to understand . MRS. EPPINGWELL I did my best to break her influence . The time and thought I 've wasted upon that man ! It 's almost scandalous the way I 've devoted myself to him ! Sitka Charley believes I am in love with him — told me so to my face . And it 's all wasted , card parties and everything . What was I against the only woman in Klondike who possesses a piano and a maid ? And to-night he runs away down the river with her . CAPT . EPPINGWELL With Freda Moloof ? MRS. EPPINGWELL With Freda Moloof . There she is now , buying things for the journey most probably . CAPT . EPPINGWELL<stage>Turning to look at Freda , and turning back again .</stage>I must say she could n't have done better if he is worth all you say he is . I remember him now , a strapping fellow , brave as a lion and all that . MRS. EPPINGWELL Yes , but he 's caressed more shovel-handles than women 's hands , and that 's the trouble with him . And I do n't know what I shall do . CAPT . EPPINGWELL You could scarcely serve an injunction on him . MRS. EPPINGWELL I do n't know what I 'll do . Floyd Vanderlip is not the sort of man to appeal to . To try to impress him to do the right thing would be like setting fire to a powder mill . I wish I knew how near Flossie is . There has n't been a courier or a mail carrier in for weeks and weeks . The mail from Dyea is twenty days overdue .<stage>Enter Mail Carrier , carrying leather mail-pouch . He is clad in a long squirrel-skin parka reaching to his knees , the hood drawn over his head and ears and leaving only jace exposed . Face and mouth are iced-up , making speech impossible . He does not stop to brush snow jrom moccasins , but proceeds rapidly to cross to stove .</stage>CAPT . EPPINGWELL There is the man who can tell you about Flossie . Shall I ask him ? MRS. EPPINGWELL Oh ! the mail carrier ? At last ! And in the nick of time . Yes , do . CAPT . EPPINGWELL<stage>Stepping into the path of the Mail Carrier .</stage>What 's the news ?<stage>Mail Carrier makes dumb show that he cannot speak , waving his arms and pointing to his iced mouth and then to the stove .</stage><stage>Capt . Eppingwell laughs and lets him pass .</stage><stage>To Mrs. Eppingwell .</stage>He 's so iced up he cannot speak . Wait till he thaws out , and then I 'll get hold of him . In the meantime — MRS.

     <p>MRS. EPPINGWELL Yes , she is a fascinating woman , our latest acquisition . An Old World Hungarian with all the do and dare of the New World blood . She was a friend of the Queen of Roumania . Posed as a model for the Queen . Had cardinals and princes at her beck and call . Plenty of money , of course , position , and all that . Came into the Klondike out of sheer love of adventure , and possibly because she was bored . You 'll enjoy her , I know . There she is over there . Do you care to ?<stage>Mrs. Eppingwell and Capt . Eppingwell walk over to left rear to Loraine Lisznayi and Prince .</stage><stage>Mail Carrier tries to get to stove , but is blocked by miners , who are demanding : “ What 's the news ? ” “ How 's the trail ? ” “ Any letters for me ? ” “ And me ? ” “ And me ? ” “ Where did you meet O'Brien ?

     <speaker>FREDA</speaker>
     <p>Now this little girl is coming in over the ice — her name is Flossie . She has lived a soft life down in California , where the sun is warm and there is no snow . She does not know hardship , nor the trail , and she is having a hard time now on the trail . Think of it !— sixty-five degrees below zero this morning , and she is out in it , walking , walking , walking , her breath freezing , her mouth icing up , her eyebrows rimed with frost . And she is very stiff , and sore , and tired . Every step of the trail she takes in pain . It is like a bad dream to her , Charley . But she sees , always before her , at the end of the dream , an awakening at Dawson , in the arms of the man who is to marry her . But , Charley , what if when she gets to Dawson there is no Floyd Vanderlip ? no man to marry her ? It will break her heart . It will be no happy awakening from a bad dream , but the beginning of a worse dream . And she is a little girl , Charley — not a strong woman like me who does not care . She will care , and she will know nobody , and she will cry , and cry , and cry . Did you ever hear a woman cry , Charley ? Think of it , she is only a little girl .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SITKA CHARLEY</speaker>
     <p>Um . More like baby .</p>

     <p>I thought so . And now to win the race . Dogs first of all . Flossie must be brought in to-night . I want you here in Dawson , Charley . So you must send some Indian up the trail with a fresh team of dogs . Flossie camps at Mooseback tonight . He is to let her think that Vanderlip has sent the dogs , and that Vanderlip wants her to come right on to-night . Understand ?</p>

Eppingwell come forward to stove and warm their hands .</stage>CAPT . EPPINGWELL<stage>Continuing conversation .</stage>Perhaps Freda does n't know about Flossie . I always thought her a good girl at heart . MRS. EPPINGWELL Why this haste then ? Why are they running away to-night instead of to-morrow as they had planned ? They must have received information somehow , even before the mail carrier arrived .<stage>Enter Mail Carrier from left .</stage>And look how she captured the mail carrier at once , and for one thing , I know , to learn Flossie 's whereabouts . CAPT . EPPINGWELL Here he is now . Let 's ask him .<stage>Beckons Mail Carrier over to him .</stage>You were talking with Freda a little while ago . What did she want to learn ?</p>

    </sp>
    <stage>Quietly . ) I knew it . CAPT . EPPINGWELL But why could n't I go around , or you , and talk with Freda , explain the situation fully to her , and make an appeal to whatever good is in her ? Mrs. Eppingwell ( Smiling . ) You do n't know women , Archie , ( Adding as an afterthought . ) Well as women know women . No , she must be beaten at her own game . Flossie must arrive before midnight to-night . CAPT . EPPINGWELL But she camps at Mooseback . MRS. EPPINGWELL There are dogs in Dawson . Now , Archie , this is for you to do . Borrow a team of fresh dogs somewhere , put your Indian in charge of it , that one-eyed man , he 's faithful , and start him up the trail to Flossie . Let her think Floyd Vanderlip has sent the dogs to bring her in right away . CAPT . EPPINGWELL</stage>
    <stage>Smiling . ) Ah , I see . The impatience of the ardent and long-denied lover . MRS. EPPINGWELL ( Smiling in return . ) And once Flossie is here and gets her arms around Floyd Vanderlip 's neck , Freda Moloof will wait in vain at the water-hole . CAPT . EPPINGWELL That will settle it . Freda 's not the woman to stand knocking her feet around a water-hole very long for any man . MRS. EPPINGWELL ( Good-naturedly . ) You seem to know a great deal about what kind of a woman this dancer is . CAPT . EPPINGWELL I know enough about her , when it comes to Vanderlip and Flossie , to think her the best of the boiling ... and to have a sneaking regret for her being beaten this way . MRS. EPPINGWELL You may be kind-hearted , Archie , but you are unwise . CAPT . EPPINGWELL</stage>
    <stage>Sighing . ) Oh , well , after the manner of civilized man I submit to my womenkind . All right , I 'll send the dogs at once . ( Makes a movement to start toward door to right , and Mrs. Eppingwell starts with him . ) ( Mrs. Eppingwell , struck suddenly by a new idea , pauses . Capt . Eppingwell pauses a step in advance and looks at her . ) What 's wrong now ? MRS. EPPINGWELL Suppose there is some mischance , a delay , and Flossie does n't get in by midnight ? CAPT . EPPINGWELL Then Freda wins . MRS. EPPINGWELL</stage>
    <stage>Decisively . ) No , she does n't . ( Thinks for a moment . ) Floyd Vanderlip is coming to the ball . I 'll see that he comes . I 'll be very nice to him and watch him closely so that he does not sneak away . If Flossie fails to arrive , say by half-past eleven , I 'll be taken ill , and I 'll ask Vanderlip to take me home ; and I 'll hold him , no matter how terribly ill or terribly nice I have to be , until midnight is well past or until Flossie arrives . CAPT . EPPINGWELL Then it 's my duty to disappear about the time you are taken ill. MRS. EPPINGWELL Archie , though I tell you for the thousandth time , you are a perfect dear . And I can be as terribly nice as I please to Floyd Vanderlip ? ( Capt . Eppingwell laughs and nods , and they continue toward door . ) MRS. EPPINGWELL ( While they are pulling on mittens , etc . ) And now the dogs . Do n't delay a moment , Archie , please . CAPT . EPPINGWELL The one-eyed man and the six dogs start at once .</stage>
    <stage>They go out . ) ( Only clerks behind counter are left on the stage . ) ( Nothing happens for a full minute , when Mrs. McFee appears at right , peeping through door , which she holds ajar . She peers cautiously about , enters , and sniffs the air several times . Then she smiles a sour smile of satisfaction .</stage>

     <stage>Scene . Anteroom of Pioneer Hall . It is ten-thirty P. M . The room is large and bare . Its walls are of logs , stuffed between with brown moss . Street door to rear , in centre . Doors , window-frames , and sashes of rough , unstained pine boards . At one side of door is wisp-broom for brushing snow from moccasins . On either side of door is an ordinary small-paned window , and beneath either window is a rough wooden bench . Under benches are large out-door moccasins , left there after the manner of overshoes , by their owners . In available space on rear wall , many wooden pegs , on which are hanging furs , parkas , hats , wraps , etc . Midway between front and rear , and at equal distances between centre and sides , running at full blast , are two large wood-burning stoves . Alongside each stove is a wood-box filled with firewood . On right , a window . On left , wide doorway , open , connecting with ballroom . Through doorway come occasional snatches of dance-music , bursts of laughter and of voices . Because it is very cold , street door is kept closed , and is opened by doorkeeper only when some one knocks , and then only long enough for that one to enter . All parleying is done on inside with door closed . Prince , as doorkeeper , is standing at rear by street door . Men and women , in costume , are disappearing through door to left , from where come strains of a waltz .</stage>

    <stage>Firmly . ) Nevertheless , let me tell you . It may interest you . ( Makes appropriate gestures . ) Here was the stove , here the piano . Three-fingered Jack played the fiddle . It was Old Dan Tucker that we danced . Remember ? ( She shakes her head . ) There was the doorway to the front , always open . Through it came the clatter of chips , the rattle of roulette balls , the calls of the gamekeepers . And there was the rear door . It opened upon the street . When it opened the frost came through , in a cloud of vapor , rolling along the floor and hiding the feet and legs of the dancers to the knees . And we danced , you and I , we danced Old Dan Tucker .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Innocently .</stage>How interesting ! Tell me , that — that what you described , it is a — a dance-hall ? Am I right ? CAPT .

      <l>Tucker as well as we danced it that — that night .</l>

    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDA</speaker>
     <p>Far be it from me to get away from it . On the contrary , I sought after it , and I flatter myself that I got it pretty close to the original . I 'd like to meet this Freda . I 'll wager my accent is nearer hers than her own is . CAPT . EPPINGWELL<stage>Completely beaten , slowly .</stage>Then who the deuce are you ? Where could you have learned that accent ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDA</speaker>
     <p><stage>As one will tell a story .</stage>Why , I was caught in a storm over on Indian River . We were compelled to seek shelter in a little cabin , and whom should we find there , likewise driven in by the storm , but this Freda Moloof . There was no standing on ceremony nor conventionality . It was life or death , and in I went . We were storm-bound two days . And she was very kind to me .<stage>A pause , then , voice tender and sympathetic .</stage>I felt so sorry for her .</p>

    <head type="act">ACT III — FREDA MOLOOF 'S CABIN</head>
    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>Scene . Freda Moloofs cabin . It is eleven forty-five at night . The room is large , and luxuriously furnished . Its walls are of logs stuffed between with brown moss . Doors of rough , unstained pine boards , also window-frames and sashes . Street door to rear , in centre . On either side of door is an ordinary , small-paned window . To left of door a plain chair . On rear wall , near door , are wooden pegs , from which hang cloaks , wraps , furs , etc ., also wisp-brooms for brushing snow from moccasins .</stage>
     <stage>The luxury of furnishing is of the solid order . No gim-cracks , no bric-a-brac . Furniture is rough , made in the Klondike . Tables , chairs , etc ., are unpolished ; they are made from pine lumber , are unstained , rough , massive . There is no carpet . Bearskins , etc ., litter the floor . Strange juxtaposition of rough pine furniture , costly rugs , etc . ; and , strangest of all , a grand piano . The cheapest and simplest and ugliest of kerosene lamps are used for lighting purposes , also candles . On walls are magnificent moose-horns and other appropriate trophies and weapons of the Northland ( such as great ivory-headed spears and a pair of tusks of the mammoth ) ; but there are no framed paintings .</stage>
     <stage>Midway between front and rear , and midway between centre and right , a large , wood-burning stove . Beside it a woodbox . On stove a tea-kettle is simmering . To left of stove , and near it , table , with table-cover on it , a few books and magazines , and a cheap kerosene lamp ; around table several pine chairs . Between table and stove two easy chairs of rough pine , massive , thrown over with furs . On right , at front , against wall , a large , comfortable lounging-couch with many cushions . On left , at front , a grand piano . On piano a small , gilt French clock is ticking .</stage>
     <stage>The room is luxurious , comfortable , picturesque , emphasizing the contact of civilization and the wilderness . In short , it is the best possible living apartment that money can purchase in the Klondike .</stage>
     <stage>A Maid is in easy chair , reading magazine and yawning . Door opens on right . Indian enters with armful of firewood , which he carries to stove and dumps in woodbox . He proceeds to put several sticks of wood into stave and to adjust damper . His entrance arouses Maid , who looks up , yawns , lays magazine face-down on lap , yawns again , at same time stretching arms behind head , and glances at clock . It is quite a distance to clock . She rubs eyes and looks again .</stage>

     <p><stage>Listening .</stage>There she comes now .<stage>Maid rises to her feet , like a soldier coming to attention , hastily puts magazine on table , and brushes down front of skirt . Indian puts another stick of wood into stove and busies himself with raking ashes level in ash-box of stove .</stage><stage>Street door opens . Freda enters , leading Vanderlip by the hand . Both are mittened and in same wraps , coats , etc ., with which they left anteroom of Pioneer Hall .</stage><stage>Indian finishes with stove and goes out slowly to right . Maid goes to rear and helps Freda off with wraps , moccasins , etc .</stage><stage>Vanderlip , who has come in reluctantly , does not remove mittens or cap , and stands sullenly inside the door , though he cannot forbear glancing curiously around .</stage></p>

     <speaker>FREDA</speaker>
     <p>I suppose it 's nice in palaces — for a time . But one would soon tire . The world is good , but life should be many-sided .

I 'm going to bed .<stage>Starts to go toward door at left .</stage>Minnie , see Mr. Vanderlip out , please .<stage>Turning head over shoulder , looking back at Vanderlip , and beginning again her silvery laughter .
