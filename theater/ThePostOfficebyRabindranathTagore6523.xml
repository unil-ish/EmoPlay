     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>What a state I am in ! Before he came , nothing mattered ; I felt so free . But now that he has come , goodness knows from where , my heart is filled with his dear self , and my home will be no home to me when he leaves . Doctor , do you think he —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHYSICIAN</speaker>
     <p>If there 's life in his fate , then he will live long . But what the medical scriptures say , it seems —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>Great heavens , what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHYSICIAN</speaker>
     <p>The scriptures have it : “ Bile or palsey , cold or gout spring all alike . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>Oh , get along , do n't fling your scriptures at me ; you only make me more anxious ; tell me what I can do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHYSICIAN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taking snuff</stage>The patient needs the most scrupulous care .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>That 's true ; but tell me how .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHYSICIAN</speaker>
     <p>I have already mentioned , on no account must he be let out of doors . MADHAV Poor child , it is very hard to keep him indoors all day long .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHYSICIAN</speaker>
     <p>What else can you do ? The autumn sun and the damp are both very bad for the little fellow — for the scriptures have it : /* “ In wheezing , swoon or in nervous fret , In jaundice or leaden eyes — ” */</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>Never mind the scriptures , please . Eh , then we must shut the poor thing up . Is there no other method ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHYSICIAN</speaker>
     <p>None at all : for , “ In the wind and in the sun — ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>What will your “ in this and in that ” do for me now ? Why do n't you let them alone and come straight to the point ? What 's to be done then ? Your system is very , very hard for the poor boy ; and he is so quiet too with all his pain and sickness . It tears my heart to see him wince , as he takes your medicine .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHYSICIAN</speaker>
     <p>effect . That 's why the sage Chyabana observes : “ In medicine as in good advices , the least palatable ones are the truest . ” Ah , well ! I must be trotting now .<stage>Exit</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <stage>GAFFER enters</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>Well , I 'm jiggered , there 's Gaffer now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GAFFER</speaker>
     <p>Why , why , I wo n't bite you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>No , but you are a devil to send children off their heads .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GAFFER</speaker>
     <p>But you are n't a child , and you 've no child in the house ; why worry then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>Oh , but I have brought a child into the house .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GAFFER</speaker>
     <p>Indeed , how so ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>You remember how my wife was dying to adopt a child ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GAFFER</speaker>
     <p>Yes , but that 's an old story ; you did n't like the idea .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>You know , brother , how hard all this getting money in has been . That somebody else 's child would sail in and waste all this money earned with so much trouble — Oh , I hated the idea . But this boy clings to my heart in such a queer sort of way —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GAFFER</speaker>
     <p>So that 's the trouble ! and your money goes all for him and feels jolly lucky it does go at all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>Formerly , earning was a sort of passion with me ; I simply could n't help working for money . Now , I make money and as I know it is all for this dear boy , earning becomes a joy to me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GAFFER</speaker>
     <p>Ah , well , and where did you pick him up ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>He is the son of a man who was a brother to my wife by village ties . He has had no mother since infancy ; and now the other day he lost his father as well .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GAFFER</speaker>
     <p>Poor thing : and so he needs me all the more .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>The doctor says all the organs of his little body are at loggerheads with each other , and there is n't much hope for his life . There is only one way to save him and that is to keep him out of this autumn wind and sun . But you are such a terror ! What with this game of yours at your age , too , to get children out of doors !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GAFFER</speaker>
     <p>God bless my soul ! So I 'm already as bad as autumn wind and sun , eh ! But , friend , I know something , too , of the game of keeping them indoors . When my day 's work is over I am coming in to make friends with this child of yours .<stage>Exit</stage></p>

     <p>Uncle , I say , Uncle !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>Hullo ! Is that you , Amal ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>May n't I be out of the courtyard at all ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>No , my dear , no .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>See , there where Auntie grinds lentils in the quirn , the squirrel is sitting with his tail up and with his wee hands he 's picking up the broken grains of lentils and crunching them . Ca n't I run up there ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>No , my darling , no .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Wish I were a squirrel !— it would be lovely . Uncle , why wo n't you let me go about ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>Doctor says it 's bad for you to be out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>How can the doctor know ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>What a thing to say ! The doctor can n't know and he reads such huge books !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Does his book-learning tell him everything ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>Of course , do n't you know ! AMAL<stage>With a sigh</stage>Ah , I am so stupid ! I do n't read books .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>Now , think of it ; very , very learned people are all like you ; they are never out of doors .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Are n't they really ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>No , how can they ? Early and late they toil and moil at their books , and they 've eyes for nothing else . Now , my little man , you are going to be learned when you grow up ; and then you will stay at home and read such big books , and people will notice you and say , “ he 's a wonder . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>No , no , Uncle ; I beg of you by your dear feet — I do n't want to be learned , I wo n't .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>Dear , dear ; it would have been my saving if I could have been learned .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>No , I would rather go about and see everything that there is .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>Listen to that ! See ! What will you see , what is there so much to see ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>See that far-away hill from our window — I often long to go beyond those hills and right away .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>Oh , you silly ! As if there 's nothing more to be done but just get up to the top of that hill and away ! Eh ! You do n't talk sense , my boy . Now listen , since that hill stands there upright as a barrier , it means you can n't get beyond it . Else , what was the use in heaping up so many large stones to make such a big affair of it , eh !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Uncle , do you think it is meant to prevent your crossing over ? It seems to me because the earth can n't speak it raises its hands into the sky and beckons . And those who live far and sit alone by their windows can see the signal . But I suppose the learned people —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>No , they do n't have time for that sort of nonsense . They are not crazy like you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Do you know , yesterday I met someone quite as crazy as I am .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>Gracious me , really , how so ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>He had a bamboo staff on his shoulder with a small bundle at the top , and a brass pot in his left hand , and an old pair of shoes on ; he was making for those hills straight across that meadow there . I called out to him and asked , “ Where are you going ? ” He answered , “ I do n't know , anywhere ! ” I asked again , “ Why are you going ? ” He said , “ I 'm going out to seek work . ” Say , Uncle , have you to seek work ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>Of course I have to . There 's many about looking for jobs .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>How lovely ! I 'll go about , like them too , finding things to do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>Suppose you seek and do n't find . Then —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Would n't that be jolly ? Then I should go farther ! I watched that man slowly walking on with his pair of worn out shoes . And when he got to where the water flows under the fig tree , he stopped and washed his feet in the stream . Then he took out from his bundle some gram-flour , moistened it with water and began to eat . Then he tied up his bundle and shouldered it again ; tucked up his cloth above his knees and crossed the stream . I 've asked Auntie to let me go up to the stream , and eat my gram-flour just like him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>And what did your Auntie say to that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Auntie said , “ Get well and then I 'll take you over there . ”</l>
      <l>Please , Uncle , when shall I get well ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>It wo n't be long , dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Really , but then I shall go right away the moment I 'm well again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>And where will you go ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I will walk on , crossing so many streams , wading through water . Everybody will be asleep with their doors shut in the heat of the day and I will tramp on and on seeking work far , very far .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>I see ! I think you had better be getting well first ; then —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>But then you wo n't want me to be learned , will you , Uncle ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>What would you rather be then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>I can n't think of anything just now ; but I 'll tell you later on .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>Very well . But mind you , you are n't to call out and talk to strangers again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>But I love to talk to strangers !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>Suppose they had kidnapped you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>That would have been splendid ! But no one ever takes me away . They all want me to stay in here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>I am off to my work — but , darling , you wo n't go out , will you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>No , I wo n't . But , Uncle , you 'll let me be in this room by the roadside .</p>

     <p>My poor child , whatever has happened to you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>I can n't tell . You see I am not learned , so I do n't know what 's the matter with me . Say , Dairyman , where do you come from ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAIRYMAN</speaker>
     <p>From our village .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Your village ? Is it very far ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAIRYMAN</speaker>
     <p>Our village lies on the river Shamli at the foot of the Panch-mura hills .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Panch-mura hills ! Shamli river ! I wonder . I may have seen your village . I can n't think when though !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAIRYMAN</speaker>
     <p>Have you seen it ? Been to the foot of those hills ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Never . But I seem to remember having seen it . Your village is under some very old big trees , just by the side of the red road — is n't that so ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAIRYMAN</speaker>
     <p>That 's right , child .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>And on the slope of the hill cattle grazing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAIRYMAN</speaker>
     <p>How wonderful ! Are n't there cattle grazing in our village ! Indeed , there are !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>And your women with red sarees fill their pitchers from the river and carry them on their heads .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAIRYMAN</speaker>
     <p>Good , that 's right . Women from our dairy village do come and draw their water from the river ; but then it is n't everyone who has a red saree to put on . But , my dear child , surely you must have been there for a walk some time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Really , Dairyman , never been there at all . But the first day doctor lets me go out , you are going to take me to your village .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAIRYMAN</speaker>
     <p>I will , my child , with pleasure .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>And you 'll teach me to cry curds and shoulder the yoke like you and walk the long , long road ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAIRYMAN</speaker>
     <p>Dear , dear , did you ever ? Why should you sell curds ? No , you will read big books and be learned .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>No , I never want to be learned — I 'll be like you and take my curds from the village by the red road near the old banyan tree , and I will hawk it from cottage to cottage . Oh , how do you cry — “ Curd , curd , good nice curd ! ” Teach me the tune , will you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAIRYMAN</speaker>
     <p>Dear , dear , teach you the tune ; what an idea !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Please do . I love to hear it . I can n't tell you how queer I feel when I hear you cry out from the bend of that road , through the line of those trees ! Do you know I feel like that when I hear the shrill cry of kites from almost the end of the sky ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAIRYMAN</speaker>
     <p>Dear child , will you have some curds ? Yes , do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>But I have no money .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAIRYMAN</speaker>
     <p>No , no , no , do n't talk of money ! You 'll make me so happy if you have a little curds from me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Say , have I kept you too long ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAIRYMAN</speaker>
     <p>Not a bit ; it has been no loss to me at all ; you have taught me how to be happy selling curds .<stage>Exit</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p><stage>Intoning</stage>Curds , curds , good nice curds — from the dairy village — from the country of the Panch-mura hills by the Shamli bank . Curds , good curds ; in the early morning the women make the cows stand in a row under the trees and milk them , and in the evening they turn the milk into curds . Curds , good curds . Hello , there 's the watchman on his rounds . Watchman , I say , come and have a word with me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WATCHMAN</speaker>
     <p>What 's all this row you are making ? Are n't you afraid of the likes of me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>No , why should I be ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WATCHMAN</speaker>
     <p>Suppose I march you off then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Where will you take me to ? Is it very far , right beyond the hills ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WATCHMAN</speaker>
     <p>Suppose I march you straight to the King ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>To the King ! Do , will you ? But the doctor wo n't let me go out . No one can ever take me away . I 've got to stay here all day long .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WATCHMAN</speaker>
     <p>Doctor wo n't let you , poor fellow ! So I see ! Your face is pale and there are dark rings round your eyes . Your veins stick out from your poor thin hands .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Wo n't you sound the gong , Watchman ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WATCHMAN</speaker>
     <p>Time has not yet come .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>How curious ! Some say time has not yet come , and some say time has gone by ! But surely your time will come the moment you strike the gong !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WATCHMAN</speaker>
     <p>That 's not possible ; I strike up the gong only when it is time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I love to hear your gong . When it is midday and our meal is over , Uncle goes off to his work and Auntie falls asleep reading her Râmayana , and in the courtyard under the shadow of the wall our doggie sleeps with his nose in his curled up tail ; then your gong strikes out , “ Dong , dong , dong ! ” Tell me why does your gong sound ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WATCHMAN</speaker>
     <p>My gong sounds to tell the people , Time waits for none , but goes on forever .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Where , to what land ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WATCHMAN</speaker>
     <p>That none knows .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Then I suppose no one has ever been there ! Oh , I do wish to fly with the time to that land of which no one knows anything .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WATCHMAN</speaker>
     <p>All of us have to get there one day , my child .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Have I too ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WATCHMAN</speaker>
     <p>Yes , you too !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>But doctor wo n't let me out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WATCHMAN</speaker>
     <p>One day the doctor himself may take you there by the hand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>He wo n't ; you do n't know him . He only keeps me in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WATCHMAN</speaker>
     <p>One greater than he comes and lets us free .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>When will this great doctor come for me ? I can n't stick in here any more .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WATCHMAN</speaker>
     <p>Should n't talk like that , my child .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>No . I am here where they have left me — I never move a bit . But when your gong goes off , dong , dong , dong , it goes to my heart . Say , Watchman ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WATCHMAN</speaker>
     <p>Yes , my dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Say , what 's going on there in that big house on the other side , where there is a flag flying high up and the people are always going in and out ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WATCHMAN</speaker>
     <p>Oh , there ? That 's our new Post Office .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Post Office ? Whose ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WATCHMAN</speaker>
     <p>Whose ? Why , the King 's surely !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Do letters come from the King to his office here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WATCHMAN</speaker>
     <p>Of course . One fine day there may be a letter for you in there .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>A letter for me ? But I am only a little boy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WATCHMAN</speaker>
     <p>The King sends tiny notes to little boys .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Oh , how lovely ! When shall I have my letter ? How do you guess he 'll write to me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WATCHMAN</speaker>
     <p>Otherwise why should he set his Post Office here right in front of your open window , with the golden flag flying ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>But who will fetch me my King 's letter when it comes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WATCHMAN</speaker>
     <p>The King has many postmen . Do n't you see them run about with round gilt badges on their chests ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Well , where do they go ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WATCHMAN</speaker>
     <p>Oh , from door to door , all through the country .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>I 'll be the King 's postman when I grow up .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WATCHMAN</speaker>
     <p>Ha ! ha ! Postman , indeed ! Rain or shine , rich or poor , from house to house delivering letters — that 's very great work !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>That 's what I 'd like best . What makes you smile so ? Oh , yes , your work is great too . When it is silent everywhere in the heat of the noonday , your gong sounds , Dong , dong , dong ,— and sometimes when I wake up at night all of a sudden and find our lamp blown out , I can hear through the darkness your gong slowly sounding , Dong , dong , dong !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WATCHMAN</speaker>
     <p>There 's the village headman ! I must be off . If he catches me gossiping with you there 'll be a great to do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>The headman ? Whereabouts is he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WATCHMAN</speaker>
     <p>Right down the road there ; see that huge palm-leaf umbrella hopping along ? That 's him !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>I suppose the King 's made him our headman here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WATCHMAN</speaker>
     <p>Made him ? Oh , no ! A fussy busy-body ! He knows so many ways of making himself unpleasant that everybody is afraid of him . It 's just a game for the likes of him , making trouble for everybody . I must be off now ! Must n't keep work waiting , you know ! I 'll drop in again to-morrow morning and tell you all the news of the town .<stage>Exit</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>It would be splendid to have a letter from the King every day . I 'll read them at the window . But , oh ! I can n't read writing . Who 'll read them out to me , I wonder ! Auntie reads her Râmayana ; she may know the King 's writing . If no one will , then I must keep them carefully and read them when I 'm grown up . But if the postman can n't find me ? Headman , Mr. Headman , may I have a word with you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HEADMAN</speaker>
     <p>Who is yelling after me on the highway ? Oh , you wretched monkey !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>You 're the headman . Everybody minds you . HEADMAN<stage>Looking pleased</stage>Yes , oh yes , they do ! They must !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Do the King 's postmen listen to you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HEADMAN</speaker>
     <p>They 've got to . By Jove , I 'd like to see —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Will you tell the postman it 's Amal who sits by the window here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HEADMAN</speaker>
     <p>What 's the good of that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>In case there 's a letter for me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HEADMAN</speaker>
     <p>A letter for you ! Whoever 's going to write to you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>If the King does .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HEADMAN</speaker>
     <p>Ha ! ha ! What an uncommon little fellow you are ! Ha ! ha ! the King indeed , are n't you his bosom friend , eh ! You have n't met for a long while and the King is pining , I am sure . Wait till to-morrow and you 'll have your letter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Say , Headman , why do you speak to me in that tone of voice ? Are you cross ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HEADMAN</speaker>
     <p>Upon my word ! Cross , indeed ! You write to the King ! Madhav is devilish swell nowadays . He 'd made a little pile ; and so kings and padishahs are everyday talk with his people . Let me find him once and I 'll make him dance . Oh , you snipper-snapper ! I 'll get the King 's letter sent to your house — indeed I will !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>No , no , please do n't trouble yourself about it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HEADMAN</speaker>
     <p>And why not , pray ! I 'll tell the King about you and he wo n't be very long . One of his footmen will come along presently for news of you . Madhav 's impudence staggers me . If the King hears of this , that 'll take some of his nonsense out of him .<stage>Exit</stage></p>

     <speaker>GIRL</speaker>
     <p>Ah me ! Do n't then ! Should listen to the doctor . People 'll be cross with you if you 're naughty . I know , always looking out and watching must make you feel tired . Let me close the window a bit for you .</p>

     <p>No , do n't , only this one 's open ! All the others are shut . But will you tell me who you are ? Do n't seem to know you .</p>

     <p>What do you do ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>SUDHA</speaker>
     <p>I gather flowers in my basket .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Oh , flower gathering ! That is why your feet seem so glad and your anklets jingle so merrily as you walk . Wish I could be out too . Then I would pick some flowers for you from the very topmost branches right out of sight .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SUDHA</speaker>
     <p>Would you really ? Do you know more about flowers than I ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I do , quite as much . I know all about Champa of the fairy tale and his seven brothers . If only they let me , I 'll go right into the dense forest where you can n't find your way . And where the honey-sipping hummingbird rocks himself on the end of the thinnest branch , I will flower out as a champa . Would you be my sister Parul ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SUDHA</speaker>
     <p>You are silly ! How can I be sister Parul when I am Sudha and my mother is Sasi , the flower-seller ? I have to weave so many garlands a day . It would be jolly if I could lounge here like you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>What would you do then , all the day long ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SUDHA</speaker>
     <p>I could have great times with my doll Benay the bride , and Meni the pussycat and — but I say it is getting late and I must n't stop , or I wo n't find a single flower .</p>

     <p>Ah , well — now do n't you be naughty . Be good and sit still and on my way back home with the flowers I 'll come and talk with you .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>And you 'll let me have a flower then ?</p>

    </sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BOYS</speaker>
     <p>You do n't want them back ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Oh , no , I sha n't want them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BOYS</speaker>
     <p>Say , wo n't you get a scolding for this ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>No one will scold me . But will you play with them in front of our door for a while every morning ? I 'll get you new ones when these are old .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BOYS</speaker>
     <p>Oh , yes , we will . Say , chaps , put these sepoys into a line . We 'll play at war ; where can we get a musket ? Oh , look here , this bit of reed will do nicely . Say , but you 're off to sleep already .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>I 'm afraid I 'm sleepy . I do n't know , I feel like it at times . I have been sitting a long while and I 'm tired ; my back aches .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BOYS</speaker>
     <p>It 's only early noon now . How is it you 're sleepy ? Listen ! The gong 's sounding the first watch .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Yes , dong , dong , dong , it tolls me to sleep .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>I want to ask you something before you go . You are always out — do you know of the King 's postmen ?</p>

     <p>Yes , quite well .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Do you think they will know me if there 's a letter for me ?</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Ca n't I go near the window to-day , Uncle ? Would the doctor mind that too ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>Yes , darling , you see you 've made yourself worse squatting there day after day .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Oh , no , I do n't know if it 's made me more ill , but I always feel well when I 'm there .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>No , you do n't ; you squat there and make friends with the whole lot of people round here , old and young , as if they are holding a fair right under my eaves — flesh and blood wo n't stand that strain . Just see — your face is quite pale .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>Uncle , I fear my fakir 'll pass and not see me by the window .</p>

     <p>Your fakir , whoever 's that ?</p>

     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>He comes and chats to me of the many lands where he 's been . I love to hear him .</p>

     <p>How 's that ? I do n't know of any fakirs .</p>

     <p>This is about the time he comes in . I beg of you , by your dear feet , ask him in for a moment to talk to me here .</p>

     <p>The Parrots ’ Isle !</p>

     <p>Is it so very astonishing ? Am I like you , man ? A journey does n't cost a thing . I tramp just where I like .</p>

     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p><stage>Clapping</stage>How jolly for you ! Remember your promise to take me with you as your follower when I 'm well .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FAKIR</speaker>
     <p>Of course , and I 'll teach you such secrets too of travelling that nothing in sea or forest or mountain can bar your way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>What 's all this rigmarole ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GAFFER</speaker>
     <p>Amal , my dear , I bow to nothing in sea or mountain ; but if the doctor joins in with this uncle of yours , then I with all my magic must own myself beaten .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>No . Uncle sha n't tell the doctor . And I promise to lie quiet ; but the day I am well , off I go with the Fakir and nothing in sea or mountain or torrent shall stand in my way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>Fie , dear child , do n't keep on harping upon going ! It makes me so sad to hear you talk so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Tell me , Fakir , what the Parrots ’ Isle is like .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GAFFER</speaker>
     <p>It 's a land of wonders ; it 's a haunt of birds . There 's no man ; and they neither speak nor walk , they simply sing and they fly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>How glorious ! And it 's by some sea ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GAFFER</speaker>
     <p>Of course . It 's on the sea .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>And green hills are there ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GAFFER</speaker>
     <p>Indeed , they live among the green hills ; and in the time of the sunset when there is a red glow on the hillside , all the birds with their green wings flock back to their nests .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>And there are waterfalls !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GAFFER</speaker>
     <p>Dear me , of course ; you do n't have a hill without its waterfalls . Oh , it 's like molten diamonds ; and , my dear , what dances they have ! Do n't they make the pebbles sing as they rush over them to the sea . No devil of a doctor can stop them for a moment . The birds looked upon me as nothing but a man , quite a trifling creature without wings — and they would have nothing to do with me . Were it not so I would build a small cabin for myself among their crowd of nests and pass my days counting the sea waves .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>How I wish I were a bird ! Then —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GAFFER</speaker>
     <p>But that would have been a bit of a job ; I hear you 've fixed up with the dairyman to be a hawker of curds when you grow up ; I 'm afraid such business wo n't flourish among birds ; you might land yourself into serious loss .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>Really this is too much . Between you two I shall turn crazy . Now , I 'm off .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>Has the dairyman been , Uncle ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MADHAV</speaker>
     <p>And why should n't he ? He wo n't bother his head running errands for your pet fakir , in and out among the nests in his Parrots ’ Isle . But he has left a jar of curd for you saying that he is rather busy with his niece 's wedding in the village , and he has got to order a band at Kamlipara .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>But he is going to marry me to his little niece .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GAFFER</speaker>
     <p>Dear me , we are in a fix now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AMAL</speaker>
     <p>He said she would find me a lovely little bride with a pair of pearl drops in her ears and dressed in a lovely red sâree ; and in the morning she would milk with her own hands the black cow and feed me with warm milk with foam on it from a brand new earthen cruse ; and in the evenings she would carry the lamp round the cow-house , and then come and sit by me to tell me tales of Champa and his six brothers .</p>
