      <stage>Night , in the garden of NAAMAN at Damascus . At the left , on a slightly raised terrace , the palace , with softly gleaming lights and music coming from the open latticed windows . The garden is full of oleanders , roses , pomegranates , abundance of crimson flowers ; the air is heavy with their fragrance : a fountain at the right is plashing gently : behind it is an arbour covered with vines . Near the centre of the garden stands a small , hideous image of the god Rimmon . Back of the arbour rises the lofty square tower of the House of Rimmon , which casts a shadow from the moon across the garden . The background is a wide , hilly landscape , with a high road passing over the mountains toward the snow-clad summits of Mount Hermon in the distance . Enter by the palace door , the lady TSARPI , robed in red and gold , and followed by her maids , KHAMMA and NUBTA . She remains on the terrace : they go down into the garden , looking about , and returning to her .</stage>

     <sp>
      <speaker>KHAMMA</speaker>
      <p>There 's no one here ; the garden is asleep .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>NUBTA</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>:</l>
       <l>The flowers are nodding , all the birds abed ,</l>
       <l>And nothing wakes except the watchful stars !</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KHAMMA</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>:</l>
       <l>The stars are sentinels discreet and mute :</l>
       <l>How many things they know and never tell !</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TSARPI</speaker>
      <lg>
       <stage>Impatiently .</stage>
       <l>Unlike the stars , how many things you tell</l>
       <l>And do not know ! When comes your master home ?</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NUBTA</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>:</l>
       <l>Lady , his armour-bearer brought us word</l>
       <l>An hour ago , the master will be here</l>
       <l>At moonset , not before .</l>
      </lg>

     <sp>
      <speaker>TSARPI</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>:</l>
       <l>He haunts the camp</l>
       <l>And leaves me much alone ; yet I can pass</l>
       <l>The time of absence not unhappily ,</l>
       <l>If I but know the time of his return .</l>
       <l>An hour of moonlight yet ! Khamma , my mirror !</l>
       <l>These curls are ill arranged , this veil too low ,—</l>
       <l>So ,— that is better , careless maids ! Withdraw ,—</l>
       <l>But warn me if your master should appear .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KHAMMA</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>:</l>
       <l>Mistress , have no concern ; for when we hear</l>
       <l>The clatter of his horse along the street ,</l>
       <l>We 'll run this way and lead your dancers down</l>
       <l>With song and laughter ,— you shall know in time .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <stage>Exeunt KHAMMA and NUBTA , laughing . TSARPI descends the steps .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TSARPI</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>:</l>
       <l>My guest is late ; but he will surely come !</l>
       <l>Hunger and thirst will bring him to my feet .</l>
       <l>The man who burns to drain the cup of love ,—</l>
       <l>The priest whose greed of glory never fails ,—</l>
       <l>Both , both have need of me , and he will come .</l>
       <l>And I ,— what do I need ? Why everything</l>
       <l>That helps my beauty to a higher throne ;</l>
       <l>All that a priest can promise , all a man</l>
       <l>Can give , and all a god bestow , I need :</l>
       <l>This may a woman win , and this will I .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <stage>Enter REZON quietly from the shadow of the trees . He stands behind TSARPI and listens , smiling , to her last words . Then he drops his mantle of leopard-skin , and lifts his high-priest 's rod of bronze , shaped at one end like a star , at the other like a thunderbolt .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>REZON</speaker>
      <p>Tsarpi !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TSARPI</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>:</l>
       <l>The mistress of the house of Naaman</l>
       <l>Salutes the keeper of the House of Rimmon .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <stage>She bows low before him .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>REZON</speaker>
      <p>Rimmon receives you with his star of peace ;<stage>He lowers the star-point of the rod , which glows for a moment with rosy light above her head .</stage>And I , his chosen minister , kneel down Before your regal beauty , and implore The welcome of the woman for the man .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TSARPI</speaker>
      <lg>
       <stage>Giving him her hand , but holding off his embrace .</stage>
       <l>Thus Tsarpi welcomes Rezon ! Nay , no more !</l>
       <l>Till I have heard what errand brings you here</l>
       <l>By night , within the garden of the man</l>
       <l>Who hates you most and fears you least in all Damascus .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>REZON</speaker>
      <lg>
       <stage>Rising , and speaking angrily .</stage>
       <l>Trust me , I repay his scorn</l>
       <l>With double hatred ,— Naaman , the man</l>
       <l>Whom the King honours and the people love ,</l>
       <l>Who stands against the nobles and the priests ,</l>
       <l>Against the oracles of Rimmon 's House ,</l>
       <l>And cries , “ We 'll fight to keep Damascus free ! ”</l>
       <l>This powerful fool , this impious devotee</l>
       <l>Of liberty , who loves the city more</l>
       <l>Than he reveres the city 's ancient god :</l>
       <l>This frigid husband who sets you below</l>
       <l>His dream of duty to a horde of slaves :</l>
       <l>This man I hate , and I will humble him .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TSARPI</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>:</l>
       <l>I think I hate him too . He stands apart</l>
       <l>From me , ev'n while he holds me in his arms ,</l>
       <l>By something that I cannot understand ,</l>
       <l>Nor supple to my will , nor melt with tears ,</l>
       <l>Nor quite dissolve with blandishments , although</l>
       <l>He swears he loves his wife next to his honour !</l>
       <l>Next ? That 's too low ! I will be first or nothing .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>REZON</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>:</l>
       <l>With me you are the first , the absolute !</l>
       <l>When you and I have triumphed you shall reign ;</l>
       <l>And you and I will bring this hero down .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TSARPI</speaker>
      <p>But how ? For he is strong .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>REZON</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>:</l>
       <l>By these , the eyes</l>
       <l>Of Tsarpi ; and by this , the rod of Rimmon .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TSARPI</speaker>
      <p>Speak clearly ; tell your plan .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>REZON</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>:</l>
       <l>You know the host</l>
       <l>Of the Assyrian king has broken forth</l>
       <l>Again to conquer us . Envoys have come</l>
       <l>From Shalmaneser to demand surrender .</l>
       <l>Our king Benhadad wavers , for he knows</l>
       <l>His weakness . All the nobles , all the rich ,</l>
       <l>Would purchase peace that they may grow more rich :</l>
       <l>Only the people and the soldiers , led</l>
       <l>By Naaman , would fight for liberty .</l>
       <l>Blind fools ! To-day the envoys came to pay</l>
       <l>Their worship to our god , whom they adore</l>
       <l>In Nineveh as Asshur 's brother-god .</l>
       <l>They talked with me in secret . Promises ,</l>
       <l>Great promises ! For every noble house</l>
       <l>That urges peace , a noble recompense :</l>
       <l>The king , submissive , kept in royal state</l>
       <l>And splendour : most of all , honour and wealth</l>
       <l>Shall crown the House of Rimmon , and his priest ,—</l>
       <l>Yea , and his priestess . For we two will rise</l>
       <l>Upon the city 's fall . The common folk</l>
       <l>Shall suffer ; Naaman shall sink with them</l>
       <l>In wreck ; but I shall rise , and you shall rise</l>
       <l>Above me ! You shall climb , through incense-smoke ,</l>
       <l>And days of pomp , and nights of revelry ,</l>
       <l>Glorious rites and ecstasies of love ,</l>
       <l>Unto the topmost room in Rimmon 's tower ,</l>
       <l>The secret , lofty room , the couch of bliss ,</l>
       <l>And the divine embraces of the god .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TSARPI</speaker>
      <lg>
       <stage>Throwing out her arms in exultation .</stage>
       <l>All , all I wish ! What must I do for this ?</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>REZON</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>:</l>
       <l>Turn Naaman away from thoughts of war ;</l>
       <l>Or purchase him with love 's delights to yield</l>
       <l>This point ,— I care not how ,— and afterwards</l>
       <l>The future shall be ours .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TSARPI</speaker>
      <p>And if I fail ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>REZON</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>:</l>
       <l>I have another shaft . The last appeal ,</l>
       <l>Before the king decides , is to the oracle</l>
       <l>Of Rimmon . You shall read the signs !</l>
       <l>A former priestess of his temple , you</l>
       <l>Shall be the interpreter of heaven , and speak</l>
       <l>A word to melt this brazen soldier 's heart</l>
       <l>Within his breast .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TSARPI</speaker>
      <p>But if it flame instead ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>REZON</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>:</l>
       <l>I know the way to quench that flame . The cup ,</l>
       <l>The parting cup your hand shall give to him !</l>
       <l>What if the curse of Rimmon should infect</l>
       <l>That wine with sacred venom , secretly</l>
       <l>To work within his veins , week after week</l>
       <l>Corrupting all the currents of his blood ,</l>
       <l>Dimming his eyes , wasting his flesh ? What then ?</l>
       <l>Would he prevail in war ? Would he come back</l>
       <l>To glory , or to shame ? What think you ?</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TSARPI</speaker>
      <p>I ? I do not think ; I only do my part . But can the gods bless this ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>REZON</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>:</l>
       <l>The gods can bless</l>
       <l>Whatever they decree ; their will makes right ;</l>
       <l>And this is for the glory of the house</l>
       <l>Of Rimmon ,— and for thee , my queen . Come , come !</l>
       <l>The night grows dark : we 'll perfect our alliance .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <stage>REZON draws her with him , embracing her , through the shadows of the garden . RUAHMAH , who has been sleeping in the arbour , has been awakened during the dialogue , and has been dimly visible in her white dress , behind the vines . She parts them and comes out , pushing back her long , dark hair from her temples .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>RUAHMAH</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>:</l>
       <l>What have I heard ? O God , what shame is this</l>
       <l>Plotted beneath Thy pure and silent stars !</l>
       <l>Was it for this that I was brought away</l>
       <l>Captive from Israel 's blessed hills to serve</l>
       <l>A heathen mistress in a land of lies ?</l>
       <l>Ah , treacherous , shameful priest ! Ah , shameless wife</l>
       <l>Of one too noble to suspect thy guilt !</l>
       <l>The very greatness of his generous heart</l>
       <l>Betrays him to their hands . What can I do ?</l>
       <l>Nothing ,— a slave ,— hated and mocked by all</l>
       <l>My fellow-slaves ! O bitter prison-life !</l>
       <l>I smother in this black , betraying air</l>
       <l>Of lust and luxury ; I faint beneath</l>
       <l>The shadow of this House of Rimmon . God</l>
       <l>Have mercy ! Lead me out to Israel .</l>
       <l>To Israel !</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <stage>Music and laughter heard within the palace . The doors fly open and a flood of men and women , dancers , players , flushed with wine , dishevelled , pour down the steps , KHAMMA and NUBTA with them . They crown the image with roses and dance around it . RUAHMAH is discovered crouching beside the arbour . They drag her out before the image .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NUBTA</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>:</l>
       <l>Look ! Here 's the Hebrew maid ,—</l>
       <l>She 's homesick ; let us comfort her !</l>

       <stage>They put their arms around her .</stage>
       <l>Yes , dancing is the cure for homesickness .</l>
       <l>We 'll make her dance .</l>

     <sp>
      <speaker>KHAMMA</speaker>
      <p>Then sing for us ,— a song of Israel !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>RUAHMAH</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>:</l>
       <l>How can I sing the songs of Israel</l>
       <l>In this strange country ? O my heart would break</l>
       <l>With grief in every note of that dear music .</l>
      </lg>

     <sp>
      <speaker>A SERVANT</speaker>
      <p>A stubborn and unfriendly maid ! We 'll whip her .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>They circle around her , striking her with rose-branches ; she sinks to her knees , covering her face with her bare arms , which bleed .</stage>

      <p>The following morning . The audience-hall in BENHADAD 'S palace . The sides of the hall are lined with lofty columns : the back opens toward the city , with descending steps : the House of Rimmon with its high tower is seen in the background . The throne is at the right in front : opposite is the royal door of entrance , guarded by four tall sentinels . Enter at the rear between the columns , RAKHAZ , SABALLIDIN , HAZAEL , IZDUBHAR .</p>

      <speaker>RAKHAZ</speaker>
      <p><stage>Puffing and blowing .</stage>Ho ! Naaman ? Where have you been living ? Naaman is a broken reed whose claws have been cut . Build no hopes on that foundation , for it will upset in the midst of the sea and leave you hanging in the air .</p>

      <p>He clatters like a windmill . What would he say , Hazael ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HAZAEL</speaker>
      <p>Naaman can do nothing without the command of the King ; and the King fears to order the army to march without the approval of the gods . The High Priest is against it . The House of Rimmon is for peace with Asshur .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>RAKHAZ</speaker>
      <p>Yes , and all the nobles are for peace . We are the men whose wisdom lights the rudder that upholds the chariot of state . Would we be rich if we were not wise ? Do we not know better than the rabble what medicine will silence this fire that threatens to drown us ?</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>HAZAEL</speaker>
      <p>Not us , my lord , only the common people . The envoys have offered favourable terms to the priests , and the nobles , and the King . No palace , no temple , shall be plundered . Only the shops , and the markets , and the houses of the multitude shall be given up to the Bull . He will eat his supper from the pot of lentils , not from our golden plate .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>RAKHAZ</speaker>
      <p>Yes , and all who speak for peace in the council shall be enriched ; our heads shall be crowned with seats of honour in the processions of the Assyrian king . He needs wise counsellors to help him guide the ship of empire onto the solid rock of prosperity . You must be with us , my lords Izdubhar and Saballidin , and let the stars of your wisdom roar loudly for peace .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SABALLIDIN</speaker>
      <p>I know not . Can a kingdom live without a people or an army ? If we let the Bull in to sup on the lentils , will he not make his breakfast in our vineyards ?</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHUMAKIM</speaker>
      <p>A politician that is stuffed with big words ; a fat man in a mask ; one that plays a solemn tune on a sackbut full o ’ wind .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HAZAEL</speaker>
      <p>And what is a politician ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHUMAKIM</speaker>
      <p>A statesman that has dropped his mask and cracked his sackbut . Men trust him for what he is , and he never deceives them , because he always lies .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>IZDUBHAR</speaker>
      <p>Why do you call me a patriot ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHUMAKIM</speaker>
      <p>Because you know what is good for you ; you love your country as you love your pelf . You feel for the common people ,— as the wolf feels for the sheep .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SABALLIDIN</speaker>
      <p>And what am I ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHUMAKIM</speaker>
      <p>A fool , master , just a plain fool ; and there is hope of thee for that reason . Embrace me , brother , and taste this ; but not too much ,— it will intoxicate thee with sobriety .</p>

     <stage>NAAMAN ; O King , I am unlearned in the lore of priests ; Yet well I know that there are hidden powers About us , working mortal weal and woe Beyond the force of mortal to control . And if these powers appear in love and truth , I think they must be gods , and worship them . But if their secret will is manifest In blind decrees of sheer omnipotence , That punish where no fault is found , and smite The poor with undeserved calamity , And pierce the undefended in the dark With arrows of injustice , and foredoom The innocent to burn in endless pain , I will not call this fierce almightiness Divine . Though I must bear , with every man , The burden of my life ordained , I 'll keep My soul unterrified , and tread the path Of truth and honour with a steady heart ! But if I err in this ; and if there be Divinities whose will is cruel , unjust , Capricious and supreme , I will forswear The favour of these gods , and take my part With man to suffer and for man to die . Have ye not heard , my lords ? The oracle Proclaims to me , to me alone , the doom Of vengeance if I lead the army out . “ Conquered or conquering ! ” I grip that chance ! Damascus free , her foes all beaten back , The people saved from slavery , the King Upheld in honour on his ancient throne ,— O what 's the cost of this ? I 'll gladly pay Whatever gods there be , whatever price They ask for this one victory . Give me This gilded sign of shame to carry back ; I 'll shake it in the face of Asshur 's king , And break it on his teeth .</stage>

      <l>The death-white seal , the finger-print of doom !</l>

      <l>Gnawing his fingers bone from bone , until</l>
      <l>The impious heart that dared defy the gods</l>
      <l>Dissolves in the slow death which now begins .</l>
      <l>Unclean ! unclean ! Henceforward he is dead :</l>
      <l>No human hand shall touch him , and no home</l>
      <l>Of men shall give him shelter . He shall walk</l>
      <l>Only with corpses of the selfsame death</l>
      <l>Down the long path to a forgotten tomb .</l>

       <l>Of Israel had read our monarch 's letter ,</l>
       <l>He rent his clothes , and cried , “ Am I a god ,</l>

       <l>I trust he sleeps ; ‘ t were kind to let him sleep !</l>

       <l>And all the burden of his hopeless woe</l>
       <l>Is lifted from him by the gentle hand</l>
       <l>Of slumber . Oh , to those bereft of hope</l>
       <l>Sleep is the only blessing left ,— the last</l>
       <l>Asylum of the weary , the one sign</l>
       <l>Of pity from impenetrable heaven .</l>
       <l>Waking is strife : sleep is the truce of God !</l>

       <l>Yes ! For you enforce my heart</l>
       <l>By honour to resign its great desire ,</l>
       <l>And love itself to offer sacrifice</l>
       <l>Of all disloyal dreams on its own altar .</l>
       <l>Yet love remains ; therefore I pray you , think</l>
       <l>How surely you must lose in our contention .</l>
       <l>For I am known to Naaman : but you</l>
       <l>He blindly takes for Tsarpi . ‘ Tis to her</l>
       <l>He gives his gratitude : the praise you win</l>
       <l>Endears her name .</l>

       <l>Her name ? Why , what is that ?</l>
       <l>A name is but an empty shell , a mask</l>
       <l>That does not change the features of the face</l>
       <l>Beneath it . Can a name rejoice , or weep ,</l>
       <l>Or hope ? Can it be moved by tenderness</l>
       <l>To daily services of love , or feel the warmth</l>
       <l>Of dear companionship ? How many things</l>
       <l>We call by names that have no meaning : kings</l>
       <l>That cannot rule ; and gods that are not good ;</l>
       <l>And wives that do not love ! It matters not</l>
       <l>What syllables he utters when he calls ,</l>
       <l>‘ Tis I who come ,— ‘ tis I who minister</l>
       <l>Unto my lord , and mine the living heart</l>

       <l>Of sorrow in his black , forsaken hour ,—</l>
       <l>And if this error makes his burdened heart</l>

       <l>Whom do I rob ? Not her who chose to stay</l>
       <l>At ease in Rimmon 's House ! Surely not him !</l>
       <l>Only myself ? And that enriches me .</l>
       <l>Why trouble we the master ? Let it go ,—</l>

Look up , my heart , from every hill In folds of rose and daffodil The sunrise banners flow . O fly away on silent wing , ye boding owls of night ! O welcome little birds that sing the coming-in of light ! For new , and new , and ever-new , The golden bud within the blue ; And every morning seems to say</speaker>

      <stage>Inner court of the House of Rimmon ; a temple with huge pillars at each side . In the right foreground the seat of the King ; at the left , of equal height , the seat of the High Priest . In the background a broad flight of steps , rising to a curtain of cloudy gray , embroidered with two gigantic hands holding thunderbolts . The temple is in half darkness at first . Enter KHAMMA and NUBTA , robed as Kharimati , or religious dancers , in gowns of black gauze with yellow embroideries and mantles .</stage>
     </stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KHAMMA</speaker>
      <p>All is ready for the rites of worship ; our lady will play a great part in them . She has put on her Tyrian robes , and all her ornaments .</p>

      <speaker>NUBTA</speaker>
      <p>That is a sure sign of a religious purpose . She is most devout , our lady Tsarpi !</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>KHAMMA</speaker>
      <p>How can he come back ? The Hebrew slave that went away with him , when they caught her , said that he was dead . The High Priest has shut her up in the prison of the temple , accusing her of her master 's death .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NUBTA</speaker>
      <p>Yet I think he does not believe it , for I heard him telling our mistress what to do if Naaman should return .</p>

      <p>What , then ?</p>

      <speaker>NUBTA</speaker>
      <p>She will claim him as her husband . Was she not wedded to him before the god ? That is a sacred bond . Only the High Priest can loose it . She will keep her hold on Naaman for the sake of the House of Rimmon . A wife knows her husband 's secrets , she can tell ——</p>

      <p>You must have heard that he went away to Samaria to look for healing . Some say that he died on the journey ; but others say he has been cured , and is on his way home to his wife .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHUMAKIM</speaker>
      <p>It may be , for this is a mad world , and men never know when they are well off ,— except us fools . But he must come soon if he would find his wife as he parted from her ,— or the city where he left it . The Assyrians have returned with a greater army , and this time they will make an end of us . There is no Naaman how , and the Bull will devour Damascus like a bunch of leeks , flowers and all ,— flowers and all , my double-budded fair one ! Are you not afraid ?</p>

      <speaker>SHUMAKIM</speaker>
      <p>What ? The mighty one who hides behind the curtain there , and tells his secrets to Rezon ? No doubt he will take care of you , and of himself . Whatever game is played , the gods never lose . But for the protection , of the common people and the rest of us fools , I would rather have Naaman at the head of an army than all the sacred images between here and Babylon .</p>

      <p><stage>Bitterly .</stage>How can he punish me ? Has he not already made me a fool ? Hark , here comes my brother the High Priest , and my brother the King . Rimmon made us all ; but nobody knows who made Rimmon , except the High Priest ; and he will never tell .</p>
