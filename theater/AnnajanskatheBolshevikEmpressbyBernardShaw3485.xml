    <docTitle><titlePart>ANNAJANSKA , THE BOLSHEVIK EMPRESS By George Bernard Shaw</titlePart></docTitle>
   </titlePage>
   <performance>ANNAJANSKA is frankly a bravura piece . The modern variety theatre demands for its “ turns ” little plays called sketches , to last twenty minutes or so , and to enable some favorite performer to make a brief but dazzling appearance on some barely passable dramatic pretext . Miss Lillah McCarthy and I , as author and actress , have helped to make one another famous on many serious occasions , from Man and Superman to Androcles ; and Mr Charles Ricketts has not disdained to snatch moments from his painting and sculpture to design some wonderful dresses for us . We three unbent as Mrs Siddons , Sir Joshua Reynolds and Dr Johnson might have unbent , to devise a turn for the Coliseum variety theatre . Not that we would set down the art of the variety theatre as something to be condescended to , or our own art as elephantine . We should rather crave indulgence as three novices fresh from the awful legitimacy of the highbrow theatre .</performance>
   <titlePage>
    <docImprint>Well , Miss McCarthy and Mr Ricketts justified themselves easily in the glamor of the footlights , to the strains of Tchaikovsky 's<date>1812</date>. I fear I did not . I have received only one compliment on my share ; and that was from a friend who said , “ It is the only one of your works that is not too long . ” So I have made it a page or two longer , according to my own precept : EMBRACE YOUR REPROACHES : THEY ARE OFTEN GLORIES IN DISGUISE . Annajanska was first performed at the Coliseum Theatre in<settlement>London</settlement>on the 21st January ,<date>1918</date>, with Lillah McCarthy as the Grand Duchess , Henry Miller as Schneidekind , and Randle Ayrton as General Strammfest .</docImprint>

  <body>
   <stage type="setting">
    <stage>The General 's office in a military station on the east front in Beotia . An office table with a telephone , writing materials , official papers , etc ., is set across the room . At the end of the table , a comfortable chair for the General . Behind the chair , a window . Facing it at the other end of the table , a plain wooden bench . At the side of the table , with its back to the door , a common chair , with a typewriter before it . Beside the door , which is opposite the end of the bench , a rack for caps and coats . There is nobody in the room .</stage>
    <stage>General Strammfest enters , followed by Lieutenant Schneidekind . They hang up their cloaks and caps . Schneidekind takes a little longer than Strammfest , who comes to the table .</stage>
   </stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>Schneidekind .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p>Yes , sir .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>Have you sent my report yet to the government ?<stage>He sits down .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p><stage>coming to the table</stage>Not yet , sir . Which government do you wish it sent to ?<stage>He sits down .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>That depends . What 's the latest ? Which of them do you think is most likely to be in power tomorrow morning ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p>Well , the provisional government was going strong yesterday . But today they say that the Prime Minister has shot himself , and that the extreme left fellow has shot all the others .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>Yes : that 's all very well ; but these fellows always shoot themselves with blank cartridge .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p>Still , even the blank cartridge means backing down . I should send the report to the Maximilianists .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>They 're no stronger than the Oppidoshavians ; and in my own opinion the Moderate Red Revolutionaries are as likely to come out on top as either of them .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p>I can easily put a few carbon sheets in the typewriter and send a copy each to the lot .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>Waste of paper . You might as well send reports to an infant school .<stage>He throws his head on the table with a groan .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p>Tired out , Sir ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>O Schneidekind , Schneidekind , how can you bear to live ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p>At my age , sir , I ask myself how can I bear to die ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>You are young , young and heartless . You are excited by the revolution : you are attached to abstract things like liberty . But my family has served the Panjandrums of Beotia faithfully for seven centuries . The Panjandrums have kept our place for us at their courts , honored us , promoted us , shed their glory on us , made us what we are . When I hear you young men declaring that you are fighting for civilization , for democracy , for the overthrow of militarism , I ask myself how can a man shed his blood for empty words used by vulgar tradesmen and common laborers : mere wind and stink .<stage>He rises , exalted by his theme .</stage>A king is a splendid reality , a man raised above us like a god . You can see him ; you can kiss his hand ; you can be cheered by his smile and terrified by his frown . I would have died for my Panjandrum as my father died for his father . Your toiling millions were only too honored to receive the toes of our boots in the proper spot for them when they displeased their betters . And now what is left in life for me ?<stage>He relapses into his chair discouraged .</stage>My Panjandrum is deposed and transported to herd with convicts . The army , his pride and glory , is paraded to hear seditious speeches from penniless rebels , with the colonel actually forced to take the chair and introduce the speaker . I myself am made Commander-in-Chief by my own solicitor : a Jew , Schneidekind ! a Hebrew Jew ! It seems only yesterday that these things would have been the ravings of a madman : today they are the commonplaces of the gutter press . I live now for three objects only : to defeat the enemy , to restore the Panjandrum , and to hang my solicitor .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p>Be careful , sir : these are dangerous views to utter nowadays . What if I were to betray you ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>What !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p>I wo n't , of course : my own father goes on just like that ; but suppose I did ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p><stage>chuckling</stage>I should accuse you of treason to the Revolution , my lad ; and they would immediately shoot you , unless you cried and asked to see your mother before you died , when they would probably change their minds and make you a brigadier . Enough .<stage>He rises and expands his chest .</stage>I feel the better for letting myself go . To business .<stage>He takes up a telegram : opens it : and is thunderstruck by its contents .</stage>Great heaven !<stage>He collapses into his chair .</stage>This is the worst blow of all .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p>What has happened ? Are we beaten ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>Man , do you think that a mere defeat could strike me down as this news does : I , who have been defeated thirteen times since the war began ? O , my master , my master , my Panjandrum !<stage>he is convulsed with sobs .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p>They have killed him ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>A dagger has been struck through his heart —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p>Good God !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>— and through mine , through mine .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p><stage>relieved</stage>Oh , a metaphorical dagger ! I thought you meant a real one . What has happened ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>His daughter the Grand Duchess Annajanska , she whom the Panjandrina loved beyond all her other children , has — has —<stage>he cannot finish .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p>Committed suicide ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>No . Better if she had . Oh , far far better .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p><stage>in hushed tones</stage>Left the Church ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p><stage>shocked</stage>Certainly not . Do not blaspheme , young man .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p>Asked for the vote ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>I would have given it to her with both hands to save her from this .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p>Save her from what ? Dash it , sir , out with it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>She has joined the Revolution .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p>But so have you , sir . We 've all joined the Revolution . She does n't mean it any more than we do .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>Heaven grant you may be right ! But that is not the worst . She had eloped with a young officer . Eloped , Schneidekind , eloped !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p><stage>not particularly impressed</stage>Yes , Sir .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>Annajanska , the beautiful , the innocent , my master 's daughter !<stage>He buries his face in his hands .</stage>The telephone rings .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p><stage>taking the receiver</stage>Yes : G. H. Q . Yes ... Do n't bawl : I 'm not a general . Who is it speaking ?... Why did n't you say so ? do n't you know your duty ? Next time you will lose your stripe ... Oh , they 've made you a colonel , have they ? Well , they 've made me a field-marshal : now what have you to say ?... Look here : what did you ring up for ? I can n't spend the day here listening to your cheek ... What ! the Grand Duchess<stage>Strammfest starts .</stage>Where did you catch her ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p><stage>snatching the telephone and listening for the answer</stage>Speak louder , will you : I am a General I know that , you dolt . Have you captured the officer that was with her ?... Damnation ! You shall answer for this : you let him go : he bribed you . You must have seen him : the fellow is in the full dress court uniform of the Panderobajensky Hussars . I give you twelve hours to catch him or ... what 's that you say about the devil ? Are you swearing at me , you ... Thousand thunders !<stage>To Schneidekind .</stage>The swine says that the Grand Duchess is a devil incarnate .<stage>Into the telephone .</stage>Filthy traitor : is that the way you dare speak of the daughter of our anointed Panjandrum ? I 'll —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p><stage>pulling the telephone from his lips</stage>Take care , sir .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>I wo n't take care : I 'll have him shot . Let go that telephone .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p>But for her own sake , sir —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>Eh ?—</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p>For her own sake they had better send her here . She will be safe in your hands .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p><stage>yielding the receiver</stage>You are right . Be civil to him . I should choke<stage>he sits down</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p><stage>into the telephone</stage>Hullo . Never mind all that : it 's only a fellow here who has been fooling with the telephone . I had to leave the room for a moment . Wash out : and send the girl along . We 'll jolly soon teach her to behave herself here ... Oh , you 've sent her already . Then why the devil did n't you say so , you —<stage>he hangs up the telephone angrily</stage>Just fancy : they started her off this morning : and all this is because the fellow likes to get on the telephone and hear himself talk now that he is a colonel .<stage>The telephone rings again . He snatches the receiver furiously .</stage>What 's the matter now ?...<stage>To the General .</stage>It 's our own people downstairs .<stage>Into the receiver .</stage>Here ! do you suppose I 've nothing else to do than to hang on to the telephone all day ?... What 's that ? Not men enough to hold her ! What do you mean ?<stage>To the General .</stage>She is there , sir .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>Tell them to send her up . I shall have to receive her without even rising , without kissing her hand , to keep up appearances before the escort . It will break my heart .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p><stage>into the receiver</stage>Send her up ... Tcha !<stage>He hangs up the receiver .</stage>He says she is halfway up already : they could n't hold her . The Grand Duchess bursts into the room , dragging with her two exhausted soldiers hanging on desperately to her arms . She is enveloped from head to foot by a fur-lined cloak , and wears a fur cap .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p><stage>pointing to the bench</stage>At the word Go , place your prisoner on the bench in a sitting posture ; and take your seats right and left of her . Go . The two soldiers make a supreme effort to force her to sit down . She flings them back so that they are forced to sit on the bench to save themselves from falling backwards over it , and is herself dragged into sitting between them . The second soldier , holding on tight to the Grand Duchess with one hand , produces papers with the other , and waves them towards Schneidekind , who takes them from him and passes them on to the General . He opens them and reads them with a grave expression .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p>Be good enough to wait , prisoner , until the General has read the papers on your case .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p><stage>to the soldiers</stage>Let go .<stage>To Strammfest</stage>Tell them to let go , or I 'll upset the bench backwards and bash our three heads on the floor .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>FIRST SOLDIER</speaker>
    <p>No , little mother . Have mercy on the poor .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>

   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p>Tell him to let go .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>Release the lady . The soldiers take their hands off her . One of them wipes his fevered brow . The other sucks his wrist .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDKIND</speaker>
    <p><stage>fiercely</stage>‘ ttention ! The two soldiers sit up stiffly .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p>Oh , let the poor man suck his wrist . It may be poisoned . I bit it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p><stage>shocked</stage>You bit a common soldier !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p>Well , I offered to cauterize it with the poker in the office stove . But he was afraid . What more could I do ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p>Why did you bite him , prisoner ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p>He would not let go .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>Did he let go when you bit him ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p>No .<stage>Patting the soldier on the back</stage>You should give the man a cross for his devotion . I could not go on eating him ; so I brought him along with me .</p>

   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>Laugh at once , sir . I order you to laugh .</p>

    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p><stage>with a touch of temper</stage>I really can n't , sir .<stage>He sits down decisively .</stage></p>

    <p><stage>rising and saluting</stage>Proletarians of all lands , unite . Lieutenant Schneidekind , you will rise and sing the Marseillaise .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p><stage>rising</stage>But I cannot , sir . I have no voice , no ear .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>Then sit down ; and bury your shame in your typewriter .<stage>Schneidekind sits down .</stage>Comrade Annajanska , you have eloped with a young officer .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p><stage>astounded</stage>General Strammfest , you lie .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>Denial , comrade , is useless . It is through that officer that your movements have been traced .<stage>The Grand Duchess is suddenly enlightened , and seems amused . Strammfest continues an a forensic manner .</stage>He joined you at the Golden Anchor in Hakonsburg . You gave us the slip there ; but the officer was traced to Potterdam , where you rejoined him and went alone to Premsylople . What have you done with that unhappy young man ? Where is he ?</p>
   </sp>

    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p><stage>pretending to whisper an important secret</stage>Where he has always been .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p><stage>eagerly</stage>Where is that ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p><stage>impetuously</stage>In your imagination . I came alone . I am alone . Hundreds of officers travel every day from Hakonsburg to Potterdam . What do I know about them ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>They travel in khaki . They do not travel in full dress court uniform as this man did .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCHNEIDEKIND</speaker>
    <p>Only officers who are eloping with grand duchesses wear court uniform : otherwise the grand duchesses could not be seen with them .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>Hold your tongue .<stage>Schneidekind , in high dudgeon , folds his arms and retires from the conversation . The General returns to his paper and to his examination of the Grand Duchess .</stage>This officer travelled with your passport . What have you to say to that ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p>Bosh ! How could a man travel with a woman 's passport ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>It is quite simple , as you very well know . A dozen travellers arrive at the boundary . The official collects their passports . He counts twelve persons ; then counts the passports . If there are twelve , he is satisfied .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p>Then how do you know that one of the passports was mine ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>A waiter at the Potterdam Hotel looked at the officer 's passport when he was in his bath . It was your passport .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p>Stuff ! Why did he not have me arrested ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>When the waiter returned to the hotel with the police the officer had vanished ; and you were there with your own passport . They knouted him .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p>Oh ! Strammfest , send these men away . I must speak to you alone .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p><stage>rising in horror</stage>No : this is the last straw : I cannot consent . It is impossible , utterly , eternally impossible , that a daughter of the Imperial House should speak to any one alone , were it even her own husband .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p>You forget that there is an exception . She may speak to a child alone .<stage>She rises .</stage>Strammfest , you have been dandled on my grandmother 's knee . By that gracious action the dowager Panjandrina made you a child forever . So did Nature , by the way . I order you to speak to me alone . Do you hear ? I order you . For seven hundred years no member of your family has ever disobeyed an order from a member of mine . Will you disobey me ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>There is an alternative to obedience . The dead cannot disobey .<stage>He takes out his pistol and places the muzzle against his temple .</stage></p>

   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p><stage>starting like a goaded ox , and blundering fretfully about the room</stage>How can I obey six different dictators , and not one gentleman among the lot of them ? One of them orders me to make peace with the foreign enemy . Another orders me to offer all the neutral countries 48 hours to choose between adopting his views on the single tax and being instantly invaded and annihilated . A third orders me to go to a damned Socialist Conference and explain that Beotia will allow no annexations and no indemnities , and merely wishes to establish the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth throughout the universe .<stage>He finishes behind Schneidekind 's chair .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p>Damn their trifling !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>I thank Your Imperial Highness from the bottom of my heart for that expression . Europe thanks you .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p>M'yes ; but —<stage>rising</stage>Strammfest , you know that your cause — the cause of the dynasty — is lost .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>You must not say so . It is treason , even from you .<stage>He sinks , discouraged , into the chair , and covers his face with his hand .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p>Do not deceive yourself , General : never again will a Panjandrum reign in Beotia .<stage>She walks slowly across the room , brooding bitterly , and thinking aloud .</stage>We are so decayed , so out of date , so feeble , so wicked in our own despite , that we have come at last to will our own destruction .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>You are uttering blasphemy .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p>All great truths begin as blasphemies . All the king 's horses and all the king 's men cannot set up my father 's throne again . If they could , you would have done it , would you not ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>God knows I would !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p>You really mean that ? You would keep the people in their hopeless squalid misery ? you would fill those infamous prisons again with the noblest spirits in the land ? you would thrust the rising sun of liberty back into the sea of blood from which it has risen ? And all because there was in the middle of the dirt and ugliness and horror a little patch of court splendor in which you could stand with a few orders on your uniform , and yawn day after day and night after night in unspeakable boredom until your grave yawned wider still , and you fell into it because you had nothing better to do . How can you be so stupid , so heartless ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>You must be mad to think of royalty in such a way . I never yawned at court . The dogs yawned ; but that was because they were dogs : they had no imagination , no ideals , no sense of honor and dignity to sustain them .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p>My poor Strammfest : you were not often enough at court to tire of it . You were mostly soldiering ; and when you came home to have a new order pinned on your breast , your happiness came through looking at my father and mother and at me , and adoring us . Was that not so ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>Do YOU reproach me with it ? I am not ashamed of it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p>Oh , it was all very well for you , Strammfest . But think of me , of me ! standing there for you to gape at , and knowing that I was no goddess , but only a girl like any other girl ! It was cruelty to animals : you could have stuck up a wax doll or a golden calf to worship ; it would not have been bored .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>Stop ; or I shall renounce my allegiance to you . I have had women flogged for such seditious chatter as this .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p>Do not provoke me to send a bullet through your head for reminding me of it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>You always had low tastes . You are no true daughter of the Panjandrums : you are a changeling , thrust into the Panjandrina 's bed by some profligate nurse . I have heard stories of your childhood : of how —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p>Ha , ha ! Yes : they took me to the circus when I was a child . It was my first moment of happiness , my first glimpse of heaven . I ran away and joined the troupe . They caught me and dragged me back to my gilded cage ; but I had tasted freedom ; and they never could make me forget it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>Freedom ! To be the slave of an acrobat ! to be exhibited to the public ! to —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p>Oh , I was trained to that . I had learnt that part of the business at court .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>You had not been taught to strip yourself half naked and turn head over heels —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p>Man , I WANTED to get rid of my swaddling clothes and turn head over heels . I wanted to , I wanted to , I wanted to . I can do it still . Shall I do it now ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>If you do , I swear I will throw myself from the window so that I may meet your parents in heaven without having my medals torn from my breast by them .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p>Oh , you are incorrigible . You are mad , infatuated . You will not believe that we royal divinities are mere common flesh and blood even when we step down from our pedestals and tell you ourselves what a fool you are . I will argue no more with you : I will use my power . At a word from me your men will turn against you : already half of them do not salute you ; and you dare not punish them : you have to pretend not to notice it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>It is not for you to taunt me with that if it is so .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p><stage>haughtily</stage>Taunt ! I condescend to taunt ! To taunt a common General ! You forget yourself , sir .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p><stage>dropping on his knee submissively</stage>Now at last you speak like your royal self .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p>Oh , Strammfest , Strammfest , they have driven your slavery into your very bones . Why did you not spit in my face ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p><stage>rising with a shudder</stage>God forbid !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p>Well , since you will be my slave , take your orders from me . I have not come here to save our wretched family and our bloodstained crown . I am come to save the Revolution .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>Stupid as I am , I have come to think that I had better save that than save nothing . But what will the Revolution do for the people ? Do not be deceived by the fine speeches of the revolutionary leaders and the pamphlets of the revolutionary writers . How much liberty is there where they have gained the upper hand ? Are they not hanging , shooting , imprisoning as much as ever we did ? Do they ever tell the people the truth ? No : if the truth does not suit them they spread lies instead , and make it a crime to tell the truth .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p>Of course they do . Why should they not ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p><stage>hardly able to believe his ears</stage>Why should they not ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p>Yes : why should they not ? We did it . You did it , whip in hand : you flogged women for teaching children to read .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>To read sedition . To read Karl Marx .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p>Pshaw ! How could they learn to read the Bible without learning to read Karl Marx ? Why do you not stand to your guns and justify what you did , instead of making silly excuses ? Do you suppose I think flogging a woman worse than flogging a man ? I , who am a woman myself !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>I am at a loss to understand your Imperial Highness . You seem to me to contradict yourself .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p>Nonsense ! I say that if the people cannot govern themselves , they must be governed by somebody . If they will not do their duty without being half forced and half humbugged , somebody must force them and humbug them . Some energetic and capable minority must always be in power . Well , I am on the side of the energetic minority whose principles I agree with . The Revolution is as cruel as we were ; but its aims are my aims . Therefore I stand for the Revolution .</p>

    <speaker>STRAMMFEST</speaker>
    <p>What Revolution ? Which Revolution ? No two of your rabble of revolutionists mean the same thing by the Revolution What can save a mob in which every man is rushing in a different direction ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THE GRAND DUCHESS</speaker>
    <p>I will tell you . The war can save it .</p>
