    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">Some years ago while writing “ A Night In Avignon ” the thought came to me of framing two other plays that should deal respectively with the Renaissance spirit at its height and decadence , as that play had dealt with it at its beginning . For the great human upheaval that came intoxicatingly to Italy during the fourteenth , fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is so full of aesthetic contrast and glamor as to be peculiarly suitable for the doubly exacting purposes of poetic drama .</p>
    <p n="2">“ Giorgione , ” the second of these plays to be written , was published in 1911 with three other plays in a volume entitled “ The Immortal Lure , ” and like “ A Night In Avignon ” was received with such kindness as to encourage me to write the third , here presented under the name of “ Porzia . ”</p>
    <p n="3">This last play , whose period is that of “ decadent Humanism , ” or as Symonds prefers to call it , of “ The Catholic Reaction , ” is laid in Naples , where the passions of men , more than freed from the long domination of the Church and the Hereafter , seemed to reach in their grasp at this life almost incredible heights and depths of excess . And yet from amid this excess , as from a rank and unweeded garden , were springing into flower many seeds of modern intellectual enfranchisement , as the achievements of Bruno and his contemporaries witness .</p>
    <p n="4">I need only add that I have sought to use materials that would be true to the time of this final portrayal , and that I therefore trust it may be understood as an organic member of the group to which it belongs .</p>

  <body>
   <stage>SCENE : A portion of the house , terrace and garden of Rizzio on his wedding day at Naples . It is so situated as to command a view of the city , the blue Bay with Capri set like a topaz in it , the Vesuvian coast , and the Mountain itself — rising like a calm though unappeasable monitor against the land 's too sensual enchantment .</stage>
   <stage>The house , a white corner of which is visible along the right , has large doors toward the back giving upon the terrace . A vine-clad terrace wall , several feet above the level of the terrace , but much above that of the street without , runs across the rear to a cypress-set gate in the centre , and on into the lustrous Spring foliage of ilex , myrtle and orange .</stage>
   <stage>A pedestaled image of the Virgin against the house , a statue of Pan before a bower opposite , and several stone seats forward , are decked with orange blossoms that glow in the light of late afternoon .</stage>
   <stage>Music , reveling , and laughter are heard , muffled , within . Then amid a louder burst of them Osio strides angrily forth . He is followed in argumentative elation by Rizzio — clothed in Greek raiment , a book in his hand — and by Bruno .</stage>
   <stage>Osio ( as they come down ) . Proof from the teeth of aliens and fools And infidels that follow their own reason ? I want no proof ! your books should burn in Hell !</stage>
   <stage>Rizzio ( gaily ) . Because they glorify the stars in heaven ?</stage>
   <stage>Osio . I say they are heresy !</stage>
   <stage>Rizzio . And I say truth !</stage>
   <stage>[ Uplifts volume .</stage>
   <stage>That were your ears not stopped with sophistries And Jesuitry you would adjudge divine !</stage>
   <stage>[ Tosses it down .</stage>
   <stage>Bruno . Ai , Signor Osio , there 's no denying !</stage>
   <stage>[ Porzia appears anxiously at the door .</stage>
   <stage>We need but look , To learn that stars are worlds Swung out upon infinitudes of space . And as for earth — Tho Christ shed blood upon it — ‘ Tis but a pilgrim flame among them all .</stage>
   <stage>[ Porzia leaves door .</stage>
   <stage>Osio ( turning upon him ) . And you , a monk , will say so to the Church And to the Holy Office ?</stage>
   <stage>Bruno ( in humorous alarm ) . God forbid !</stage>
   <stage>Osio . And you , Rizzio , who on your wedding-day , Mid rites of Venus And revels to Apollo , Wear pagan robes — and prink others in them —</stage>
   <stage>Rizzio . Ho , others ! meaning Porzia ?</stage>
   <stage>Osio . I say —</stage>
   <stage>[ Mirth within .</stage>
   <stage>Rizzio ( laughing at him ) . What , what , my merry raging brother , more ? That Pan is not your god , whom I but now Besought for inward beauty and truth of soul ? No , no , he is not , by Vesuvius !</stage>
   <stage>Osio . I say —</stage>
   <stage>Rizzio . That Plato and the ancients are A plague which only the Pope can purge from earth ?</stage>
   <stage>[ Again laughing .</stage>
   <stage>Ai ! to the flames with them , and with all fairness !</stage>
   <stage>Osio . I say that you —</stage>
   <stage>Rizzio . Hey , yea ! that I who fall Not on my knees to mitred villainy — Or cringe to crosiered craft — And yet whose life is lit for truth and freedom — Am viler far than you Who take your pleasure and pay it with confession ? Who think the Devil with faith would be no Devil ?</stage>
   <stage>[ Porzia again appears with Bianca .</stage>
   <stage>You hear it , Bruno ?</stage>
   <stage>Osio . I say there is one thing You shall not do !</stage>
   <stage>Rizzio . So-ho ! my lordly brother , My breaker of betrothals — if not creeds — And that is what ?</stage>
   <stage>Osio . I will protect her from it !</stage>
   <stage>Rizzio . Her ?</stage>
   <stage>Osio . Porzia ! from the passion of your lies !</stage>
   <stage>[ Astonishment .</stage>
   <stage>Rizzio ( stung , staring ) . By ... all the saints and fiends and incubi That ever infested night and nunneries ! What frenzy now is biting at your brain !</stage>
   <stage>[ Before him .</stage>
   <stage>Is she your wife , so to concern your care ?</stage>
   <stage>[ They face , pale .</stage>
   <stage>Porzia ( who sees , and with Bianca comes quickly , winningly down ) . Heresy ! heresy ! truth and heresy ! Are there no other words in all the world To pour as wine Upon a wedding-day !— Are these your ways , my newly wedded lord , To leave me , an hour 's bride , away from home — From my dear uncle 's home — With but a friend or two for comforting — And bandy words of other stars than those You swear to see when gazing in my eyes !</stage>
   <stage>Rizzio ( responsively ) . My Porzia !</stage>
   <stage>Porzia . No , no ! I 'll not forgive you ! For is it not ill boding to our bridals You quarrel over the heavens — and not me !</stage>
   <stage>[ As he laughs .</stage>
   <stage>My beauty , he says , this husband I have taken , Is life — and yet ere ‘ tis an hour his Forgets to live on it !— and Osio , The brother of him ,— E'en Osio there —</stage>
   <stage>Rizzio ( gay again ) . Who swears he will protect you !</stage>
   <stage>[ Osio starts .</stage>
   <stage>Porzia . Protect ?</stage>
   <stage>Rizzio . Against the heresy of robes Of pagan fashion — and against your husband !</stage>
   <stage>[ Constraint . Porzia sees Bianca flush .</stage>
   <stage>Porzia . I do not understand — unless you jest , As oft — too oft you do ! Or mean perchance Bianca ... unto whom He was betrothed And whom he would , this breath , Be wooing again , were I , not words , your bride !</stage>
   <stage>[ Then winningly again , as Marina enters .</stage>
   <stage>But see , here is Marina ! the dance awaits !</stage>
   <stage>[ Music is heard .</stage>
   <stage>Let us go in and give ourselves to Joy , For Misery is quick enough to take us , If first we do not wed us to her rival ! Is it not so ?</stage>
   <stage>Rizzio ( with passion ) . Or sun has never shone ! So in ! the tarantelle ! ( as Tasso enters ) And then a song From Messer Tasso , who would be divine ,</stage>
   <stage>[ Greets him .</stage>
   <stage>Did he love Venus as he fears the Church , Apollo as he shuns the Inquisition ! In !— Osio , will you come ?</stage>
   <stage>Osio . I will not .</stage>
   <stage>Rizzio . Then Dance with your own mad humors and delusions Here to Vesuvius and to the sea ,— Or to Bianca plead your pardon ! ( To the rest ) Come !</stage>
   <stage>[ Seizes blossoms blithely .</stage>
   <stage>For in this world there 's but one heresy , Denial of the divinity of Joy !</stage>
   <stage>[ Throws sprays over Porzia , takes her hand and they go singing . All follow , but Osio and Bianca .</stage>
   <stage>Osio ( when their steps have died ; in cold rage ) . You shall hear more of this , my pretty brother ! Prater of pagan doubts ! Whom — but that God may use it — I would curse For the resemblance that our mother gave us ! For , by the living blood of San Gennaro , In yon Duomo , the scoffing siren song Of heresy that swells in you shall cease , Tho it shall take the sweat of the rack to hush it ! You shall hear more !...</stage>
   <stage>Bianca ( who has stood long indignant ) . And others shall hear more !</stage>
   <stage>[ Her voice breaking as she turns on him .</stage>
   <stage>Others who fix upon me this affront Of broken and humiliate betrothals !</stage>
   <stage>[ As he attempts to speak .</stage>
   <stage>Yes ! you have made of me a thing of shame Here in the eyes Of those who 're alien to me ! That you have loved me not — or love me less Than once you did , too well I came to know — I — with the blood in me of the Medici !— And now it is open prate !... But do you think The women of my city want resentment , Or less than these sun-lusting ones of Naples Know how to cool their wrath ?</stage>
   <stage>Osio . I think you mad — In a mad maze — And yield it no concern ; Nor shall — ( meaningly ) until a thing you know is done . As to betrothals , give your memory breath : Ours was agreed to end as either willed .</stage>
   <stage>[ Goes from her to gate and looks expectantly out .</stage>
   <stage>Bianca ( as he returns ) . And you , weary of it , have utterly Chosen to end it ?</stage>
   <stage>[ Sits .</stage>
   <stage>Osio . Have I so affirmed ?</stage>
   <stage>Bianca ( springing up ) . I will not have evasions , Osio ! Shiftings and turnings Radiant of hopes That torture expectation till it breaks .</stage>
   <stage>[ Again sitting .</stage>
   <stage>And yet — perchance it is as well they come Now ... while there yet is time for more withdrawals .</stage>
   <stage>Osio ( starting ) . More ?</stage>
   <stage>Bianca . For — I fear all trust in you is folly ; And that the heresy of Rizzio Which I agreed with you to take unto Monsignor Querio —</stage>
   <stage>Osio ( clenching ) . Shall not be taken ?</stage>
   <stage>[ She rises .</stage>
   <stage>Not ! but you leave the brunt to me alone ?</stage>
   <stage>Bianca . You purpose more , I think , than to restrain him .</stage>
   <stage>Osio . And you more than abjuring ! You would gaze Upon his godless schisms , ... Upon the naked luring of his lies !</stage>
   <stage>Bianca . No ! Tho the beauty of them —</stage>
   <stage>Osio . Beauty ! beauty !</stage>
   <stage>[ Striking the Pan near him .</stage>
   <stage>That wind of infidelity from Hell He blows out of his lips do you call beauty ! No !— and he with his poets and philosophers , His Platos And star-mad Copernicas , And that Dominican , Giordano Bruno , For whom the stake to flames will yet be lit , Shall learn you are too late in your relenting !</stage>
   <stage>Bianca ( stricken ) . Too ... late !</stage>
   <stage>Osio . His heresies shall reap their due .</stage>
   <stage>Bianca ( death-pale ) . Which means — that you already have revealed them ! Have sent unto Monsignor Querio To-day — Rizzio 's wedding-day !— For that It was you sought out Matteo , who , pledged Unto Marina , As were you to me , Has broke his troth ?... And now , now you await him ?— O was not Your promise to me that a week should pend Ere any step ?</stage>
   <stage>Osio . I will not lose my soul ,</stage>
   <stage>[ Turns away .</stage>
   <stage>And dallying is the feebleness of fools .</stage>
   <stage>Bianca . And will lies save it — tho they be for Heaven !— To one who nigh has lost her soul for you ?</stage>
   <stage>[ When he does not answer , more penetratively .</stage>
   <stage>We have been friends , Osio , long been friends , And , woman that I am , I would ‘ twere more , But in this I suspect —</stage>
   <stage>Osio . Enough ! we prate !</stage>
   <stage>[ Rankling , uneasily .</stage>
   <stage>I say enough .</stage>
   <stage>Bianca . And I say all too little ,</stage>
   <stage>[ Bitterly .</stage>
   <stage>Until I tell you now plain to your face , And to your heart Plunging toward this passion , That not alone a hate of heresy Is haunting you to it , but that the lips And eyes and brows and soul of —</stage>
   <stage>Osio . Will you cease !</stage>
   <stage>Bianca . I tell you that you love her — Porzia ! And veer but to the vision of her face !</stage>
   <stage>Osio ( who after strangling silence finds words ) . If you say that , Bianca , ever again Or if , by all the demons that Avernus Pours out upon the black Phlegraean fields , You hint it or suggest it to her , till —</stage>
   <stage>Bianca . Till you achieve her ! and have wrapped the rites Of the Church round your achieving ? Till you have severed her from Rizzio — Have swept her from perdition — Into your swathing arms ! I say you shall not ! Me you have set aside , but there an end !</stage>
   <stage>[ Starts toward door .</stage>
   <stage>Osio . Stop ! whither do you go ?</stage>
   <stage>Bianca . To call them ! call ! And to betray your treachery — and mine !</stage>
   <stage>[ Calling .</stage>
   <stage>Rizzio ! Porzia ! Rizzio !</stage>
   <stage>Osio . Maledictions !</stage>
   <stage>[ Seizing her wrists .</stage>
   <stage>Will you become a dagger , and not know , Stiletto that you are , what thing you stab !</stage>
   <stage>Bianca . The infatuation festering within you ! Till , deaf with the desire of it and dream , You cannot tell their voice from Deity 's .</stage>
   <stage>[ Calls again .</stage>
   <stage>Rizzio ! Porzia ! Tasso !</stage>
   <stage>[ The music ceases .</stage>
   <stage>Rizzio ( within ; startled ) . It was Bianca !</stage>
   <stage>[ Hastening to door with the rest crowding closely after .</stage>
   <stage>How ? what ? you called ? what moves you ?— Osio ?</stage>
   <stage>[ Looks around .</stage>
   <stage>Was some one here ? what is it ? speak !... Bianca ? What burns you ?</stage>
   <stage>Bianca . You shall hear ! It must be told . Yes , yes !... ( Struggling to say it ) ... And with no leavening delay of words . We ... I ... You must be gone from here at once ; At once — for there is peril .</stage>
   <stage>Rizzio . Pah-ho ! peril ? Now , Scylla and the Sibyl and Charybdis ! What megrim have you had ?</stage>
   <stage>Bianca . None — for doubting ; Or any , it matters not , if you will go , And quickly , trusting reason — as you boast to ; For I have heard —</stage>
   <stage>Rizzio . Have heard what and from whom ?</stage>
   <stage>[ Again looks around .</stage>
   <stage>Bianca . There was one here who said Monsignor Querio Knows of your excommunicant delight In books that are forbid — And ... of your heresies !</stage>
   <stage>Porzia ( in quick dismay ) . The Inquisition ! You mean — he may be sought by it and seized , Held in the trammels of it for a truth That ...! Do you mean , Bianca , Osio , That now , at any hour —?... Oh , he must go !</stage>
   <stage>[ Hears noise at gate .</stage>
   <stage>And quickly ! In , Rizzio , in , for they —!</stage>
   <stage>[ The gate opens and Matteo entering stops amazed and alarmed .</stage>
   <stage>Rizzio ( with laughing relief ) . Now , now , do you not see your apprehension ! Is Matteo the Inquisition ! Is He then the prison that has come to seize me ? Fie , fie , Bianca , with your fears that mar Again the bridal beauty of this hour , And crowd with quiverings the bliss of it ! No more of them !— ( to dancers ) Hither ! and wind your maze ! Again take up the dance !</stage>
   <stage>Porzia . No , Rizzio , no ! For now delight would die under our feet , And we but trample on it ! No ! Dismiss them Back now to Capri !... More than the woman fear within me warns it . For you have been o'er bold — not vainly , nay , For truth , I know , must dare — but there may be More in this than you think .</stage>
   <stage>Rizzio . And ere it rises I cravenly must quench the altar-fires That I attend — and our half-wedded joys ? No ! no ! More revels ! Till we shall utterly uncloud our bliss And leave remembrance not a stain upon it ! A song , Tasso , a song ! The taunting one that swept us into laughter ! How runs it ? did it not begin with Naples ? ( Recalls it . )</stage>
   <stage>Naples sins and Torre pays , ( Torre del Greco ! ) Who fears the earthquake all her days ! ( Torre del Greco ! ) Who ....</stage>
   <stage>[ Forgets .</stage>
   <stage>Who sits beneath Vesuvius And shrives the castaways of us ! Naples sins and Torre pays , ( Torre del Greco ! )</stage>
   <stage>On , on with it ! Come Porzia !— On , on .</stage>
   <stage>Tasso ( who has stood shrinking ) . Ah , Signor , no ; I fear ; I cannot ; pray Your pardon . I must go .</stage>
   <stage>Rizzio . Go !</stage>
   <stage>Tasso . I would not Offend the Church — who is the Bride of Christ .</stage>
   <stage>Rizzio ( unaffected ) . Then off with you , unworthy follower Of Virgil , And of fire-veined Ariosto ,— Of singers who have flung their hearts to courage , As yet we shall fling ours ! ( Tasso goes . ) For even Bianca And Osio Must rue now their alarm , And help us back from it to revelry .</stage>
   <stage>[ As he turns to them , then to all .</stage>
   <stage>What , none of you ? no heart of joy about me ?</stage>
   <stage>Porzia ( striving for abandon ) . Yes , Rizzio !... tho I would have you fly ; For bodingly I breathe the breath of evil !</stage>
   <stage>[ With forced lightness .</stage>
   <stage>A dance , then ! Again weave its delight !</stage>
   <stage>[ Dancers show cheer .</stage>
   <stage>For to your want mine is attuned , and what Is music to it shall o'ermaster me ! And not alone my feet shall follow , but The Truth you fly to will I wing to attain !— Tho stars seem to my simple sight but candles Upon the altar of God , I 'll think them worlds , If to your soul they seem so ; and for the rest —</stage>
   <stage>[ A knock brings consternation , this time to all . The dancers fall to crossing themselves , some kneeling . As they do so the gate is thrown open and Querio enters ; he is followed by several guards .</stage>
   <stage>Querio ( advancing ; amid awe ) . In the name of the Vicar of God who sits at Rome , And of the Holy Office , I arrest The giver of these pagan rites and revels .</stage>
   <stage>[ Guards step to Rizzio 's side ; he stands speechless .</stage>
   <stage>Porzia ( stunned ) . Oh ,... Oh !</stage>
   <stage>Rizzio ( hoarsely ) . And at whose urgence , my lord Prelate ,</stage>
   <stage>[ Starts forward .</stage>
   <stage>I ask you at whose urgence this is done ! This deed of churchly duty !... Yes , in justice I seek ; for there has been Some traitor and perhaps a liar .— Osio ? Bianca ? ( fiercely ) half , half I believe ‘ t was you !</stage>
   <stage>[ All are appalled .</stage>
   <stage>Porzia . No , no , Rizzio !... no !... what are you saying !</stage>
   <stage>[ Restrainingly .</stage>
   <stage>Will you requite injustice with a worse ?</stage>
   <stage>[ To Querio , who is unmoved .</stage>
   <stage>Monsignor , this in truth is hunting haste , To search him out Upon his wedding-day , And bind him with the very wreaths of it ! Could you not wait an eve , a night , until To-morrow when his nuptials would be o'er !</stage>
   <stage>Querio . Who weds two brides is bigamist , Signora . When he divorces heresy accuse me . But now say your farewells , And with a moment 's privacy : that can I grant , that and no more : the rest 's with Rome .</stage>
   <stage>[ Retires to rear — as do all but the two .</stage>
   <stage>Porzia ( whom dread now begins to overwhelm ) . My Rizzio ! my own ! I cannot bear it ! O why did you not go , delaying till This fate has fallen Now like a pall upon us ! I fear ! I fear !... To be so wedded , ere I am a wife , Here in this city of dark lawless passions !</stage>
   <stage>[ Unrestrainedly .</stage>
   <stage>Ah , can you not recant ? Deny at once and so —</stage>
   <stage>Rizzio . Porzia !</stage>
   <stage>Porzia . Nay ! And yet to have you leave me — Ere any nuptial night has hung our couch , Ere I have lain beside you in the dark And like Madonna dreamed of motherhood ! Ah , ah , I cannot !...</stage>
   <stage>Rizzio ( with a thought ) . Then — listen to me .</stage>
   <stage>[ Osio starts , watching him .</stage>
   <stage>I will return to you !</stage>
   <stage>Porzia . Return ?</stage>
   <stage>Rizzio . Perchance . It may be . For with florins to the guard — With friendly gold — May he not be persuaded To bring me hither to you , for an hour At midnight — tho it be but for an hour ?</stage>
   <stage>[ They look at each other .</stage>
   <stage>Querio ( suspiciously , coming down ) . Enough , Signor ; the hour is running late . And there are here , may be ,</stage>
   <stage>[ Sinisterly .</stage>
   <stage>Some who are avid now to be at vespers .</stage>
   <stage>Porzia ( embracing Rizzio ) . Then go , my lord ; farewell , and fear not for me , Since I shall toil only for your release .</stage>
   <stage>[ He goes , with Querio and guard . Porzia quails , then lets Marina lead her into the house . All follow but Bianca , Osio , and Matteo at gate .</stage>
   <stage>Bianca ( as the twilight begins , to Osio ) . Now that you have achieved so much , what more ?</stage>
   <stage>[ He does not answer ; she also turns into house .</stage>
   <stage>Osio ( whom a turmoil of passions is tearing ) . What more ?... God in His Heaven shall decide !... Doubts have I had — like swine of hell within me — But now He shall decide — If she 's to be the mother of heretics ... Or if I , who acclaim the Creed , shall have her !</stage>
   <stage>[ Calls .</stage>
   <stage>Matteo !</stage>
   <stage>Matteo . Signor — ( advancing ) here .</stage>
   <stage>Osio . You have done well . And from to-night I take you to my service , With wages that shall gild you from a want , And with the benediction of the Church . But there is one thing more : Follow Monsignor Querio to the prison , Then to Signora Porzia return — And say her husband sent you To bid her be in the bower there at midnight .</stage>
   <stage>Matteo ( staring ) . But Signor , will she come ?</stage>
   <stage>Osio . Say that she is To speak no word — but keep to silence : go .</stage>
   <stage>[ With fixed face , when the latch clicks behind him .</stage>
   <stage>God shall decide , ... For if she does not know My arms from his , then , it shall be a sign That to them and my bed ... she was predestined .</stage>
   <stage>[ The dark grows . He turns soon to go , and the curtain falls .... But rises again at once and it is midnight ; with only dim lights from the silent , sleeping city . As it does so Porzia with Marina comes out of the house . They pause and listen , Marina half-anxiously .</stage>
   <stage>Porzia ( drawing free ) . Return and have no fear , he soon will come , And bade me be alone there in the bower . The night is like a spell to draw him to me .</stage>
   <stage>Marina . Signora —!</stage>
   <stage>Porzia . Like a spell of living love .</stage>
   <stage>[ Crosses over , as one in a dream , and enters the bower . Marina goes , the gate opens , and Osio silently enters , coming down into the bower amorously . A long silence ... then slowly the Curtain .</stage>

    <stage type="setting">
     <head>A YEAR HAS ELAPSED</head>
     <stage>SCENE : A sala , or hall , in the house of Rizzio . Its spacious walls and ceiling are frescoed with Virgilian scenes of a simpler and more beautiful kind than was usual to the decaying art of the period , and its high-arched open doors in the rear look out upon the terrace of Act I , toward the city , the Bay , Vesuvius — the whole magic curve of the haunting coast .</stage>
     <stage>Several antique terminal-statues , the bodies of which end strangely in their pedestals , stand on either side these doors , and about the hall a Venus and other rare objects of virtu recovered from the past are mingled with the furnishings of the room , which , arranged for joy and beauty , seems somehow sad when unoccupied , as now , tho the Neapolitan sun is shining brightly in from the blue .</stage>
     <stage>An arrased doorway right leads thro a passage to the street gate , and one left to the penetralia of the house , from which Marina enters deeply troubled . She looks back , shakes her head , saying , “ O my poor lady ! ” then crosses to door right , listens , and hearing nothing goes slowly to door rear , where she waits , singing sadly :</stage>
     <stage>Shepherds down the mountain wind , Wild pipes play in the street . O Sicily , my Sicily , I long for thee , my Sweet !</stage>
     <stage>Once a year God takes his joy , And that great joy is Spring , He weds earth clad in blossom-robes , For His enrapturing !</stage>
    </stage>
    <stage>She stops , listening , then resumes : Once a year God takes his joy , And that —</stage>
    <stage>She stops again hearing sounds at the gate , then is startled to paleness by the voice of Matteo ; and as she listens a stern strong determination takes her .</stage>

I cannot think it !... yet ...!<stage>Again distraught .</stage>O what is it I dread ! what thing has changed All natural thoughts within me to repugnance , All instincts and desires into terror ?

A madness whispers in me , “ Take it away ! ”<stage>Staring , hauntedly .</stage>And too , and too ... in solitude the want Of Rizzio imprisoned comes to me ; Yet when I reach for him I seem enclasped By unknown arms ... in the sere dark , that ...

     <p>Have !— it was predestined — by His breath . Was he to see you mate a heretic , Or from your body spring the Anti-Christ ? A year ago you wedded one , and I Was ready with the hands of the Inquisition . They seized him with his pagan pride upon him , And from this house of feasting and of flowers He went . You had a message brought from Matteo Saying he would return to you at midnight . I came , and in the darkness of the bower , Which God made darker , You took my arms for his !— were mine , were mine ! Porzia<stage>who has sunk to a seat , rising</stage>Never !— But now I know what I have feared , What dread it is invisibly has bound me — Invisibly , unvariably !... I know , And so shall break it ! Your thought has been to shadow me about With this unceasing thing , to make me so Believe — and so obtain me ! Your voice , eyes , lips and being with this purpose Have held my soul unswervably to fear , But now it is free ! free , free !</p>

    <stage>Matteo loathly crosses and again ascends the pedestal . But scarcely has done so when a knock comes at the gate . He steps down into the shadow of the image — Osio into bower . Then Marina appears from the house hesitantly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marina</speaker>
     <p>Who knocks ? Signor Aloysius , is it you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Aloysius</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Ai , ai ! and weary : open !</l>
<stage>Being admitted . This day ! this day ! The search till he was found ; and then the toil — The patient physic poured Vainly it seemed unto the proud or poor .</stage><stage>Taking off medicine pouch .</stage>      <l>But it at last is done . Now , the relief —</l>
      <l>He came reluctant ? and to her outpoured</l>

      <l>When he was told ?</l>

      <l>Not he ? and Bruno ?</l>
      <l>Who had been with him ,</l>
      <l>Whom he had but left</l>
      <l>To search , sudden it seemed , for Osio ?</l>
      <l>Not Bruno ! whom I pledged to find and lead him</l>
      <l>Here to her — since we learned that Osio</l>
      <l>Has fled from Naples ?</l>

    </sp>
    <sp>

      <l>To fever that has flowed into her brain !</l>
      <l>Her heart is full of moans ,</l>
      <l>Her lips of murmurs !</l>
      <l>She tore the crucifix from off her neck</l>
      <l>And flung it from her , saying that it was</l>
      <l>The arms of Osio ; and then cried out</l>
      <l>That she was virgin and immaculately</l>
      <l>Had borne a child , that now was laid in the tomb ,</l>
      <l>But should arise again . Then would she start</l>
      <l>And say there is no God , but only stars ,</l>
      <l>But stars , a heaven of stars ! For which Signora</l>
      <l>Bianca ignorant arose and chid her .</l>
     </lg>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Aloysius</speaker>

      <l>And all unduly did ! This must be stayed ,</l>
      <l>Not made immedicable .</l>
      <l>Go in ; prepare the herbs that I left with you .</l>
<stage>She goes — as he stands pondering — past Bianca , who enters .</stage>      <l>Bianca</l>
      <stage>pausing , then with resolute bitterness</stage>
      <l>So you have come and have not brought him ? Well ,</l>
      <l>The insult of this secrecy must end ,</l>
      <l>The shrouding and affronting soil of it .</l>
      <l>I 'll sift in doubt no more , but have the truth .</l>

      <l>And whence is it</l>
      <l>If she though sunk in sleep</l>
      <l>Says ever “ I must go into the bower ! ”</l>

     <p>I will go to her . Bianca<stage>angrily</stage>So to evade confessing ? To avoid granting That it is Osio ? That it is he has been her paramour ? That he it is has plundered her with passion — Whose proof is the child Which Heaven has struck dead ? Will go ? Nor first deny That rightly Rizzio has turned from her And now perchance is seeking Osio ——<stage>Breaks off , for the gate opens and Rizzio slowly enters . A deadly purpose is on him as he looks around .</stage>Rizzio<stage>at length</stage>You clothe my thought , Bianca , in the flesh Of speech that I have shunned : but we shall know —— Soon know , for I have tracked him to this gate .<stage>To Aloysius , solemnly .</stage>Where is he ?

   <note>THE COUNTRY LIFE PRESS GARDEN CITY , N. Y. FAR QUESTS CALE YOUNG RICE “ The countrymen of Cale Young Rice apparently regard him as the equal of the great American poets of the past . Far Quests is good unquestionably . It shows a wide range of thought , and sympathy , and real skill in workmanship , while occasionally it rises to heights of simplicity and truth , that suggest such inspiration as should mean lasting fame . ” — The Daily Telegraph ( London ) . “ Mr. Rice 's lyrics are deeply impressive . A large number are complete and full-blooded works of art . ” — Prof. Wm . Lyon Phelps ( Yale University ) . “ Far Quests contains much beautiful work — the work of a real poet in imagination and achievement . ” — Prof. J. W. Mackail ( Oxford University ) . “ Mr. Rice is determined to get away from local or national limitations and be at whatever cost universal .... These poems are always animated by a force and freshness of feeling rare in work of such high virtuosity . ” — The Scotsman ( Edinburgh ) . “ Mr. Cale Young Rice is acknowledged by his countrymen to be one of their great poets . There is great charm in the nature songs ( of this volume ) and of the East . Mr. Rice writes with great simplicity and beauty . ” — The Sphere ( London ) . “ Mr. Rice 's forte is a poetic drama . Yet in the act of saying this the critic is confronted by such poems as The Mystic .... These are the poems of a thinker , a man of large horizons , an optimist profoundly impressed with the pathos of man 's quest for happiness in all lands . ” — The Chicago Record-Herald . “ Mr. Rice 's latest volume shows no diminution of poetic power . Fecundity is a mark of the genuine poet , and a glance through these pages will demonstrate how rich Mr. Rice is in vitality and variety of thought .... There is too , the unmistakable quality of style . It is spontaneous , flexible , and strong with the strength of simplicity — a style of rare distinction . ” — Albert S. Henry ( The Book News Monthly , Philadelphia ) . THE IMMORTAL LURE CALE YOUNG RICE It is great art — with great vitality .— James Lane Allen . In the midst of the Spring rush there arrives one book for which all else is pushed aside .... We have been educated to the belief that a man must be long dead before he can be enrolled with the great ones . Let us forget this cruel teaching .... This volume contains four poetic dramas all different in setting , and all so beautiful that we cannot choose one more perfect than another .... Too extravagant praise cannot be given Mr . Rice .— The San Francisco Call . Four brief dramas , different from Paolo &amp; Francesca , but excelling it — or any other of Mr. Phillips 's work , it is safe to say — in a vivid presentment of a supreme moment in the lives of the characters .... They form excellent examples of the range of Mr. Rice 's genius in this field .— The New York Times Review . Mr. Rice is quite the most ambitious , and most distinguished of contemporary poetic dramatists in America .— The Boston Transcript ( W. S. Braithwaite ) . The vigor and originality of Mr. Rice 's work never outweigh that first qualification , beauty .... No American writer has so enriched the body of our poetic literature in the past few years .— The New Orleans Picayune .
