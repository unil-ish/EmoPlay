    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>SCENE .— Room next to KARL 'S studio . At the back of the stage to the L. is a glass door with portiere towards the stage . When this door is opened one can see the studio . Bach of the stage to the R. a fireplace with burning fire . Round the fireplace an elevation about half a yard high reaching into the middle of the room . This elevation is bordered by a wooden railing with an opening on each side — in the middle of the railing an ancient Gothic chair , with back towards the public ; the back of the chair must be so high that a person sitting in it cannot be seen by the public . On the R. a door leading into the entrance hall of the apartment . There is a little invisible door covered as the rest of the room , with wall paper , on the L. near the footlights . About a yard from this door , a settee with the head end towards the glass door of the studio . Next to this settee a small , ancient table , about one yard high . On the L. a curio cabinet ( small ) ; next to it a hall stand with some shawls of different colors . On L. next the settee a large , gilded , stand-up candelabra , as used in churches .</stage>
     <stage>There are many sketches , framed and unframed , about the room — some statues , some heads , and a very elegant electric candelabra hanging in the middle of the room . The whole thing unharmonious but artistic . Down stage on the R. a medium-sized table littered with books , magazines and bric-a-brac ; a large palette lies on the top of some books and scattered among the other things some tubes of paint and paint brushes .</stage>
    </stage>
    <stage>When the Curtain rises the stage is empty for a few minutes .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HEINRICH</speaker>
     <p>Nowhere , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>The door is wide open ; anybody could have walked in .<stage>HEINRICH goes into the studio and comes out with a velvet house-jacket . Calling after him :</stage>Where 's today 's paper ?<stage>He finds the newspaper .</stage>Well , hurry up .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>HEINRICH comes back and helps KARL put on his jacket .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, lights a cigarette Did you take my dress suit to be pressed ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HEINRICH</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir : he will bring it back in an hour .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Starts R .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Good ! Here 's a crown . Get me a white tie , same as the last one .<stage>HEINRICH starts R .</stage>Hold on ! Put out a dress shirt on the bed , then look for my pearl buttons — they are probably in the top drawer — in a match-box . Stop ! Give me that crown . Take this .<stage>Gives him a bill .</stage>Get me a pair of white gloves , seven and a half . Oh ! and Heinrich , before you go , put the Venetian chair next to the window . At three o'clock Mrs. Zanden will be here to have her portrait painted , and I shall be at home to nobody .<stage>Reclines on the settee .</stage>Give me an ash tray .<stage>HEINRICH gives it to him .</stage>All right ; go along .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HEINRICH</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>Ever since last fall you 've been different . I knew it right away when you started to paint landscapes . When you are in love you paint Venuses . I know what it means when you start to paint trees .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>You 're silly , Mimi .</p>
    </sp>

     <lg>
<stage>From behind him , raises his head .</stage>      <l>Look at me ! Look at me ! You want to get married ? Tell me</l>

     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>, comes to L. of him Oh , you tell me anything you want to my face ; but I know you 're going to marry a girl named Elsa — the wife of your friend Mr. Zanden has arranged everything — look at me and deny it , if you dare . After all , what 's the use ! you would n't tell me the truth anyway .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>You little mind-reader .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>She 's a nice one , Mrs. Zanden ! Instead of taking you on herself , she marries you to a friend of hers . But I do n't care ; you do n't love me any more — doing landscapes all the time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>, imitating him Yes , yes , of course . Is that the best you can do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Well , what shall I say ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>Oh ! You painters ! It 's always the same . First you say : “ What an angel ! What a Madonna ! What a Venus ! What color ! What hair ! What lines ! ” Then all of a sudden , it 's : “ Oh , my dear ! Why , you 've gone yellow . ” The next day you 're green , and then it 's : “ I have no time today . ” And , first thing you know , you 're — pooh ! Landscapes .<stage>Scornfully .</stage><stage>She goes to him above table at head of couch , takes his head in her hands .</stage>Do n't you like me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>, crossing to him at couch You will never have me pose any more for you at all ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, rises ; crosses with her to door R . I 'll look in on you this evening on my way to the Zandens ’ .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>But you can n't work in my house . I 've only a lamp !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! Well , we 'll put that out !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Has taken her to the door .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Oh , will we !</l>
<stage>Laughing .</stage>      <l>Maybe you 'll get put out .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Bye , bye !<stage>MIMI exits .</stage><stage>Lights another cigarette — the bell rings sharply . Calls , somewhat excited .</stage>Heinrich ! Heinrich !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HEINRICH</speaker>
     <p>, comes in from studio Yes , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Runs through the door on the R ., which he leaves open , and goes off to open the hall door .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p><stage>Fixes his tie nervously , puts away newspaper , puts out his cigarette in ash tray , and arranges his hair . He goes towards the door through which HERMAN and OLGA enter , HEINRICH closes the door from the outside , KARL bows .</stage>Madame !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Bows silently to HERMAN .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HERMAN</speaker>
     <p>, in a hurry I only came to bring Olga , my boy : I must go back at once .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>OLGA has been looking around .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, going to C. and over to L . So this is the famous studio .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, looking around Funny , is n't it ? More like a junk shop .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HERMAN</speaker>
     <p>We might have chosen another day to begin Olga 's portrait — we have waited six years , so we could just as well have waited until tomorrow ; but the preparations for tonight 's ball made Olga so nervous that I thought it best to bring her here . You know this ball is a kind of house-warming .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Crosses over to C .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>We were obliged to invite such a lot of people , to clear off our social obligations .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HERMAN</speaker>
     <p>I wish it was over . I hate these functions . Old Freebody , in whose business I started , was worth ninety millions , and he never gave a party in his life — or anything else , for that matter . When do you want me to call for Olga ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, R. C . Well , it gets dark very early now : in three quarters of an hour we wo n't be able to see any more .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HERMAN</speaker>
     <p>Well , then —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, looking at his watch Let 's say four o'clock .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, after looking at a picture L. very closely Who is that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Oh , some model .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Was n't that the girl we just met on the stairs ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HERMAN</speaker>
     <p>crosses quickly to L . I must have a look at her .<stage>Looks at picture .</stage><stage>OLGA stands so as to hide picture .</stage>Oh , better not .<stage>Makes a gesture as if he had seen something indecent .</stage>Well , every minute counts — I must be off .<stage>Shakes his finger at KARL .</stage>You 'll have to stop that sort of thing , now , Karl . You know you are one of the reasons of tonight 's ball . Is n't he , Olga ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Yes — tonight Karl is to fall in love with his future wife .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, goes L. C . I shall do my best .<stage>To HERMAN .</stage>Sentenced to marry ! Well , I 'm prepared to meet my doom .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, seated on couch , with a little sigh At last ! I shall be glad .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HERMAN</speaker>
     <p>So shall I . So will the girl . So will Karl .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>I hope so . She 's a charming girl .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Wait till you —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>I know — I know . I shall adore her . But I have till this evening , you know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HERMAN</speaker>
     <p>, crossing to OLGA Well , I 'm off . My agent may telephone any minute .<stage>He kisses OLGA 'S hand .</stage>I shall call for you at four o'clock , my dear . And do n't worry about tonight : the caterer has his instructions .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Crossing to R ., shaking hands with KARL , who holds him back .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, shaking HERMAN 'S hand Are n't you afraid to leave your wife ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HERMAN</speaker>
     <p>Shall I tell you the truth ? I 'm hurrying because I 'm afraid of changing my mind and taking Olga away with me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>You 're not jealous ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HERMAN</speaker>
     <p>, at door If I was n't afraid of appearing ridiculous , I would say : Be good ! And now , good-bye .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes off , KARL bringing him to the door of entrance hall .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coming back , closes the door , stands still for a minute — when he comes back , OLGA shivers slightly and touches her forehead with her hand .</stage><stage>Crosses to L. C. by OLGA .</stage>What is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, with a nervous , soft laugh Nothing — nothing at all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, tenderly Are you frightened ?<stage>OLGA does not answer .</stage>Tell me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, nervous , confused , as if she was afraid of him I do n't know , but — I feel as if — as if —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>What do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, trying to laugh , but very nervously I had the same feeling once in Dresden , when my mother took me to a boarding-school and left me there . I felt as if I were quite alone in this wide , strange world — and now — you know yourself . I have fought against coming here for six years .<stage>Looks around .</stage><stage>KARL crosses C. and up laughing . Strange monsters , cut off heads , and you in the middle of all this like a wizard . While my husband was here I did not feel it , but now these heads seem to stare at me .</stage>What a queer place . I do n't think I like it .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She shivers .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Do n't be nervous — every woman I paint comes here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, seated on couch , quietly And do you paint every woman that comes here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Silence .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Did you understand my husband just now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>I think I did .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>He has often pretended to be jealous , but this time there was a ring in his voice that made me feel that there was something behind it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>You do n't really think he 's jealous ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, crosses to chair No . But this is the first time I 've been alone with you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Now we can talk things over . I 've wanted to for a long time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, leans against R. back of chair We 've done well to avoid it all these years . A good conscience is like a warm bath — one feels so comfortable in it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Last Thursday , when we spoke about my painting your portrait , you seemed embarrassed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, looks at him ; their eyes meet Do n't let us talk about it . I do n't want to .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Do n't be afraid of me . If I were not I , your fear might be justified ; but as it is , surely we can trust ourselves to talk things over quietly . To think that seven years ago I was a teacher in Herman 's family — and I was there the day your engagement was announced — it was the evening of the day we —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, puts her hand on his , softly reproaching him Karl .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>— We kissed each other for the first time . Oh , I know . I was only a drawing teacher — but you — what were you ? Just a poor little friend of Herman 's sisters . Sometimes you were asked to tea in their grand house . And there we met — a beggar boy and a beggar girl at the rich man 's table . Do you wonder ? And then , just as we realized what we were to each other , one fine day Herman up and proposed to you . Such a dazzling offer — who could blame you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, hurt Please — please , Karl .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>We were two poor little souls who found one another in the wilderness of wealth — only to lose each other . Even the memory of that one little kiss ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Dear Karl , do n't . We have grown up to be sensible people — we have put it out of our thoughts .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I know it 's all over . To-day I 'm —<stage>humorously</stage>the famous painter , your husband is my friend , and though we see one another every day , we have never spoken of it again . I would n't even have the courage to ask you to sit for your portrait . I was afraid , and I think you were afraid . And so was your husband . And that is why until this day —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, steps down one pace from chair , gives him her hand You are a real friend .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, goes to her , gently There 's nothing to be afraid of .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Oh , it was only my husband 's voice — something in his manner that frightened me . He must know what we were to one another , though he has never made the slightest allusion to it , not one single word in all these years . But when he left us here alone , he seemed to feel —<stage>Breaks off .</stage>But there is no reason for it , is there ? We are not in love with one another , are we ? And it 's just lovely to think that we have not entirely forgotten old times . Do n't you think so , Karl ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, goes to chair Of course I do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Because if we still loved one another , you would not marry , would you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Taking off gloves .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Of course not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>So you will be married and you will be very , very happy — and I shall be happy , too , because it is my own idea , and I have picked out a nice girl for you — pretty and clever —<stage>KARL bows silent acquiescence .</stage>And now —<stage>Goes up and knocks on back of chair — business of entering imaginary door , etc . She speaks in an everyday voice , in marked contrast to former tone .</stage>How do you do , Professor ? I have come to have my portrait painted .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, quite enthusiastic , R. C . Last night I made a sketch of you from memory .... Oh , I 've made lots of sketches of you ; but now , now I see you in another light .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>

      <l>, R .</l>
      <l>How do you mean ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Yesterday I looked upon you as a model . To-day you are a motif — you are a revelation ...? there is something in your eyes ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Please , please , Karl , we agreed that — that —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Pardon me , I 'll try to remember .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Goes up on platform .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Let 's go to work now — it 's getting late .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Whenever you are ready —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>What am I to do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, steps behind her to take hat pins out of her hat Take off your hat and your coat , please .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Thanks , I can do that myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She takes her hat and coat off . KARL takes her coat up on platform .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, passing her chair as he goes up Do you use perfume in your hair ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>I ? Never !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>At chair up in alcove .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Oh , then it is the natural perfume of your hair .</l>
<stage>She looks at him reproachfully .</stage>      <l>Pardon me : I stood too near .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <stage>Looks at her in silence . She crosses back of large chair to couch L ., and sits facing audience .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, nervously , turns her head to him What is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, leaning against big chair , looking at her dress I was just thinking — did n't your husband say an evening frock ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Yes . Herman wants me painted decolletee — in an evening gown ; just a head and shoulders , you know . I would have preferred a street dress .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>I 'm afraid I agree with Herman on that point . But have you ?... Did n't you ?... Where is the dress ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I thought you would only be painting my face the first sitting .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, comes C ., laughs So you thought I began at the top of a portrait and painted down ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, hesitating Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Why , the drawing of the shoulders is almost more important than the head in the first sketch .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Oh , dear . How stupid of me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, crossing L . I 'll tell you what —<stage>He selects some draperies from those hanging in the corner .</stage>I have some draperies here —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Well —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>You can arrange one of these around your shoulders like — like an evening gown .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, mechanically Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, hanging drapery on cabinet L . You will have to be quick because it will soon be dark . Here are the draperies — you 'll find some pins over here , and I 'll go into the studio while you — until you —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Goes to door of studio .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, seated Until when ? Why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Why , if I 'm to paint your shoulders — well —<stage>Turns away towards studio .</stage>— your blouse ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, terribly embarrassed Of course —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Do just as if you were at home . I 'll close this door .<stage>Goes to door R. to entrance hall and locks it .</stage>And now I 'll go into the studio ... and you can lock this door yourself .<stage>He has opened the door of the studio and has made one step into studio , and now says in a low tone :</stage>Oh ! It 's snowing .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He looks at Olga .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Snowing ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Snowing hard .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Silence .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Had n't we better ?— perhaps — perhaps — tomorrow — or — or —<stage>She has been saying this very slowly , as if afraid , but now suddenly regains confidence , as if she had had a saving idea .</stage>Tomorrow I could bring my maid .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Oh , no , no . Your husband would certainly want to know the reason , and really — if this door is closed —<stage>He goes back to his studio .</stage>It 's too bad ! This snow takes all the light away . But never mind — never mind ; the snow shovellers will be glad of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He has spoken the last few sentences in a very low voice , as if the situation was painful to him . He goes backwards into the studio and now closes the door . [ OLGA is standing with her back towards the studio , staring in front of her . She now shrinks together , shivers , turns around . Sudden resolution , she turns the key , locking the door to the studio . Slowly unbuttons her blouse , looks at the shawls , of which she chooses one , afterwards takes her blouse off quietly , putting the shawl around her shoulders . She has put the blouse on the settee before she arranges the shawl . She now picks up the blouse and wants to put it on the chair in front of the fireplace ; her arm is already stretched out when she suddenly drops the blouse , utters a suppressed shriek , dropping blouse by chair , and crosses quickly to foot of couch .</stage>
    <stage>The DEVIL , in fashionable frock coat , a crimson carnation in buttonhole , a man of from thirty-five to thirty-eight years old , resembling in face classical Mephisto , very elegant , picks up the blouse and offers to OLGA in a most polite manner .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Pardon , Madame .<stage>Comes C. a little .</stage>I think you dropped something .<stage>OLGA takes the blouse mechanically and looks at him frightened .</stage>I must beg your pardon , Madame . I came from lunch . Karl was not at home . I waited and I fell asleep in this very comfortable chair .<stage>He rubs his eyes .</stage>Forgive me , Madame , for opening my eyes at a moment when , for propriety 's sake , I should have at least kept one eye shut .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, puts blouse on couch and goes L ., horrified and disgusted Oh !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, Right of couch L . I am aware this is a base insinuation — of course you only come here —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Ironical .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>To have my portrait painted .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>I once had a similar encounter at a dentist 's ; and the lady , to prove that my insinuations were false , did not hesitate to sacrifice a perfectly good tooth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>I tell you , I —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, very polite Oh , I know — you speak the truth . I am even at liberty to believe it , though your truth is only partly in style . Truth should have nothing on at all , you know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>The insolence ! What right have you to speak to me ? Who are you ? What are you doing here ? Karl !<stage>KARL tries door outside .</stage>Karl !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She opens the door of the studio , KARL appears on the threshold and looks surprised at the DEVIL .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, crosses up R. C. very quickly How do you do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, taken aback How do you do ?— er — how are you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, quickly You do n't seem to remember me — we met at Monte Carlo —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, up L. C . Oh , yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Quite an eventful day it was .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, comes down a little Yes , yes , I remember . It was last fall , and I had just lost all my money at roulette . As I turned from the table , I caught sight of a stranger frowning at me .<stage>Pointing to DEVIL .</stage>It was you . I was startled , because only a moment before I had seen you next to the croupier , and I thought I heard you laugh when I lost . But now I remember — you stood behind me , and when I had lost everything , you offered me , a total stranger , a handful of louis d'or .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>You refused — beggingly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Yes , but —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, continuing You took them — protestingly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>In five minutes I had won everything back , and 20 , 000 francs besides . Your gold seemed to have magic power , I remember . When you gave it to me it seemed to burn .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>But you paid me back and invited me to supper . I had to refuse , because I was obliged to leave for Spain the same evening , but I promised to look you up the next time you needed me —<stage>Crosses to R .</stage>and here I am .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Well , I 'll be —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, interrupting quickly Do n't mention it . I took a little nap in your chair .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Goes up to back of big chair .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, goes C ., pointing to big chair . Frightened It 's very strange — this chair was empty ; there was nobody there .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, stepping towards her , bowing ; in a tone allowing no contradiction Then I was mistaken , Madame .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>OLGA goes over behind couch L. Silence .</stage>
    <stage>OLGA and KARL look at the DEVIL suspiciously .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, L. C ., embarrassed Wo n't you please sit down ? Allow me to introduce you . I quite forget your name ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, R. C . Call me anything you like : we only call names when the party is absent ; but I am here now — call me Miller , or Brown , or Black .<stage>Start from KARL . DEVIL stops him .</stage>If you think Doctor sounds better , why not call me Doctor Miller ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, very much embarrassed Doctor Miller —<stage>Crosses to R. C. The DEVIL kisses OLGA 'S hand devoutly at foot of couch .</stage>Under ordinary circumstances , I should now take my hat and leave ;<stage>Goes up C .; turns .</stage>but my infinite tact compels me to force my presence upon you in this disagreeable situation .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Sits down in chair C .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, crossing to KARL ; to the DEVIL How dare you ! Karl ! This man has the insolence to —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, seated C. Very quickly Your husband has been dead some time ?</p>

     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Well , if you think that I have insulted you , I should say the proper person to refer me to would be your husband .<stage>Rises ; to KARL :</stage>Of course , if you wish , I am at your disposal also .<stage>To OLGA :</stage>But , Madame , this would be admitting —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>What 's it all about ? I do n't understand you . You come in here , I do n't know how or where from , and you — you act as if you had trapped us —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, goes to KARL R. C . The idea !</p>

     <p>Say what you like : I cannot go .</p>

     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Why not ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>If I were to go now , it would be as much as to say : “ Pardon me , I fear I intrude . ” But if I remain , I show that I suspect nothing .</p>

    <stage>Silence . The DEVIL lights a cigarette at table L. C .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, puffs cigarette . On second puff Permit me , Madame .<stage>OLGA , picking up blouse , as if suddenly awakened and realizing her position , goes into the studio , closing the door behind her .</stage>Full of temperament — full of temperament . And pretty , too .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>KARL starts to light cigarette at table L. C .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, dropping cigarette , crosses to chair up C ., sits and looks at the DEVIL without speaking</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Too bad she does n't love her husband .<stage>KARL turns quickly towards the DEVIL . Quick :</stage>How do I know ? The way she turned to you just now when she fancied herself insulted — it did n't escape me .<stage>KARL takes up the ash tray and throws it angrily on table .</stage>No ; she does n't love her husband . He must be either a genius or a very common man . Marriage with them is always unlucky . Believe me , common men live so low that women are afraid somebody will steal in at night through the window which they forgot to lock . And Genius , well ! That lives on the top floor — so many stairs , no elevator . Her ideal is —<stage>A motion of the hand , wanting to express an even , middle position .</stage>— the second floor .<stage>KARL looks impatiently at his watch and goes towards the door of the studio . The DEVIL leans back blowing the smoke of his cigarette , indifferently .</stage>This is the second time I have seen her shoulders .</p>

     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, coming down left of couch What do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>The first time I saw them was in Paris —<stage>Start from KARL .</stage>at the Louvre — only they were on the Aphrodite . Am I right ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, crossing to large chair R. C. In bad humor How should I know ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, lifting himself upright , cynically Which shoulders have you not seen ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, angry I 've seen the Aphrodite .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, seated on couch Well , you may take my word . I have seen them both . And , believe me , since Alcamenes , I have only known one sculptor who could model such shoulders .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Who 's that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Good living . Such tender , soft lines are only possible for a woman who lives exquisitely well . I take it she is the wife of a millionaire ?<stage>KARL goes again towards door of studio impatiently .</stage>Is she dressing ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, nervously I suppose so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Is there a looking-glass in your studio ?</p>
    </sp>

     <p>, comes down L. of couch Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>She must be very respectable .<stage>KARL looks at him astonished .</stage>If a lady takes as long as that to dress before a looking-glass , she 's not a — model — anyway .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, crosses around foot of couch to table L. C . Look here ! I think your remarks are , to say the least , in very bad taste .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, standing erect Do you mean that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, aggressively I do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, patting KARL 'S cheek Then you must be respectable , too .<stage>Crosses to big chair , KARL stares at him astonished .</stage>In a situation like this , only a very respectable man can be so infernally stupid .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>KARL crosses to R. OLGA opens door of studio , goes towards KARL without looking at the DEVIL , who is hidden in chair .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, dropping shawl on couch What 's the time ?</p>

    <stage>Crosses to KARL , R .</stage>

     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, looking up over back of chair He 'll be here in ten minutes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, angry Who ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Your husband .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Oh ! So you were n't asleep after all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Oh , yes , I was .<stage>Rises .</stage>But “ What 's the time ? ” always means the husband . A woman 's intuition invariably anticipates her husband 's coming by ten minutes . If it was n't for that ten minutes , there would be more divorced women —<stage>He goes and unlocks the door of the hall .</stage>— and less locked doors .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>KARL crosses to L. C .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, taking her hat Will this never stop !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>I tried to change the subject . I started to speak about the weather — the Exhibition — but Karl would n't have it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Karl !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>I ? I have n't said a single word .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, crosses to big chair But your actions fairly shouted . The way you jumped up , looked at your watch , went to the door —<stage>To OLGA :</stage>He was afraid , the poor fellow .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Afraid of what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>L. C .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, to OLGA That your husband would come before you had finished dressing . I do n't blame him .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Come now ! Let us be logical — let us look the situation in the face . Enter your husband —<stage>OLGA comes down R .</stage>“ Well , here I am : where is the picture ? ” “ The picture ? ”<stage>Shrugs his shoulders .</stage>“ There is no picture . Karl has n't even touched a brush . ” Your husband is astonished — he tries to speak — the words stick in his throat — he gasps : “ Well , if you did n't paint , why is she dressing ? ” Imagine the situation ! You look at one another horribly embarrassed ; Karl stammers something , but that only makes it worse . Nothing has happened — and yet the mischief is done . What mischief ? Appearances — appearances . They 're like fly-paper . There 's no getting away from them .<stage>Speaking to OLGA :</stage>You go home with your husband , and he does n't speak — and if you ask him : “ Why do n't you say something ? ” his blood seems to boil . If you ask him to take a cab , he suspects that you want to avoid meeting somebody — every word that you utter tortures him . And if —</p>

     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>, C .</l>
      <l>And if it were so , we are not alone , you are here .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, icy and cynical Just so , I am here — one word from me would save the situation — but — I know myself — I 'm a strange , whimsical , almost cruel man — and I 'm afraid I wo n't say the word . Tableau ! Embarrassing silence ! Then I say : “ I regret that I should have come at such an inopportune moment . ” I take my hat and walk out discreetly . If necessary , I can even stammer my excuses .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>If this is a jest , it 's a cruel one .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, bowing low Possible , Madame — but I can do better still . Of course , if you prefer it , I can make conversation — when your husband comes in , I can tell him that the portrait has not been touched and ask his pardon —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Pardon ? Pardon for what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, bowing For having — quite accidentally — seen your shoulders .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, horrified Who are you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I am one who always comes at the right moment — I come from</l>
      <l>Nowhere .</l>
<stage>Very bitingly .</stage>      <l>I am here —</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <stage>Touching OLGA 'S forehead .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>What do you want with me ? You turn everything to evil . I have scarcely known you five minutes , and I seem to feel your fingers at my throat .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>That 's because I like you . With most pretty women I take longer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, furiously , starts towards him Look here : this has gone far enough !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Makes a few steps towards the DEVIL , who stands erect without moving . At the same time , HEINRICH comes to the door , which he opens , and starts speaking at once .</stage>

     <p>Put it on the chair in the bedroom .</p>

     <p>But it 's not mine .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, gives a sign to HEINRICH to go out and do as he was told . Speaking to KARL It 's mine .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Yours ?</p>

I told the tailor to send it here . I must dress for tonight . I 'm going to a ball the prettiest woman in Vienna is giving at the house of the Duke of Maranse .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, coming down R ., frightened But the Duke does not live there now — he 's Ambassador in Madrid ; he has sold his house — to us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>I know . I met him in Paris . He told me —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>We are living there now — we are giving the ball .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Am I mistaken ? Am I not invited ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, in a very low voice , dropping her head Yes — yes , you are .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, very polite Madame , you asked me a little while ago what I wanted . That 's what I wanted . Thank you .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Bows and turns towards C. Silence .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>But my husband —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, turning to her Will be delighted . I 've just come from Odessa . I have good news . Wheat is rising — this year 's crop turned out worse than they thought it would .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, greatly pleased Yes ? The crop is bad ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The DEVIL goes to big chair and kneels on it L .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>So you do love your husband ? You 're glad the crop is a failure ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Of course I am .<stage>As if she was somewhat ashamed about her husband 's speculations .</stage>We want the wheat to be bad because that will drive the price up .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>What of that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>My husband will make lots of money .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, to OLGA And you will get that new gown .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>How do you know I want a new dress ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>You have a new hat — a very pretty one — and you will certainly want a new dress to wear with it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>You must be married .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Married ? Not the least — but I have an eye for feminine vanities . Oh , no ! A wife is like a single eyeglass — it looks very nice , but one is better off without it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, R . You seem to have strong views against marriage . May I ask why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, shaking his finger Because you are plotting matrimony against Karl , and I want to save him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, starts toward him ; stops C . I beg your pardon —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>An artist ought never to marry — his wife will swear on the wedding day to stand by his side all through life . The day after the wedding she will stand in his way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Not the real wife .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>The real wife is always the other man 's wife .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>You 're a cynic .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Oh , no , not cynical , only careful . A tigress who has married — I mean eaten — a man , is no longer dangerous — you can ride on her back through the jungle . But , you must wait till she has married — I mean eaten — somebody ; then she is quite safe .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Better to keep away from the tigress — and stay at home .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Then why did n't you stay at home P Why did you refuse a legitimate position — good , everyday morals — a decent occupation at so much a week ? You wanted to go into the jungle — and there you are . Now fight your battle — hunt tigers — but do n't get married !<stage>He now changes his tone , goes into the church chair , on whose back he leans his two arms , speaking as if from a pulpit . It is almost dark , and during this scene it becomes darker yet .</stage>And yet — what a splendid couple you two would make .<stage>OLGA , standing quite near the DEVIL but not looking at him , buries her face in her hands .</stage>Wake up !<stage>To KARL :</stage>You , with your talent , your splendid youth !<stage>To OLGA :</stage>You , with your temperament , and beauty and longing !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>crosses to R . Stop ! Stop ! I beg you —<stage>OLGA backs to R. of back of chair , as though to protect DEVIL .</stage>— for years we have been just good friends .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p><stage>He now begins to speak in almost a whisper , but getting warmer and warmer , the more embarrassed KARL and OLGA become .</stage>You may say what you like , but I can read your eyes ; they say to me : “ Do n't believe him , he lies . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Goes to fire and warms his hands , KARL stands below OLGA .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Do n't interrupt me . For six years we have been — good friends , nothing else . Olga cares nothing for me — and I — and I —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, quickly What will you give me to interrupt you now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know what you , who profess to know everything , know about us , but anyone who thinks Karl capable of one base thought must be very low and contemptible himself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p><stage>Goes behind OLGA and whispers into her ear . At the end of the speech he is a little to the L. of them by the big chair .</stage>It 's not a base thought : it 's a great thought — a thought that brings joy and warmth and light into your wretched little lives . But joy has its price — and you must pay it , you misers ! The drunkard dies of drink , but while he is drunk angels in heaven sing to him . The poet dies in the ecstasy of his sweetest song . It is a coward 's bravery that turns away from the wine , the song — and the lips of woman . The smallest candle-end shows you it is worth while to burn up for the sake of a little warmth — a little light . The only end of life is to burn — to burn yourself up . You must flame and blaze like a torch and toss the fire about you . I know : your moralists tell you to love one another — do n't believe them — your grubby little earth with its paltry million years is not ripe for such a love as that . It can only breed monks , madmen , Methodists . Do n't be a fool , be a rogue — but be a jolly rogue — and the world is yours ! Look at me ! I own the earth . Here is the key of life — Love yourself — only yourself . Dress yourself in the softest garments — kiss the sweetest lips — drink of the wine of Life — Drink ! Drink ! Drink !</p>

I had begun to feel as if some strange force — some invisible hand — was clutching me — holding me in spite of myself . There is a mystery about you . It frightens me . I thanked God when I heard that bell ring . He came just in time .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>What ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Goes to C. and sits on arm of chair by DEVIL .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>The way that woman clung to her husband 's arm as if for protection .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>For protection ?<stage>Sneeringly .</stage>From you ?</p>

     <p>Look here , my boy ; do you think you are wise to be such a fool ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>KARL rises , starts away , DEVIL catches him by hand .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>I do n't want to talk about it . You do n't seem to understand my position . I have seen this woman for years every day , and I never even thought — and if I had thought — I should have laughed at myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, rises , takes both KARL 'S hands Look at her ! She 's yours . Think what it means — joy , unspeakable joy — the most supreme joy one can have . And to think that you are too lazy to stretch out your hand ! Why , another one would toil day and night , would risk life and limb for such a prize — and it just drops at your feet — a windfall .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>I suppose that 's why —<stage>In a tone as if he did n't think much of it .</stage>— just a windfall .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Sits on couch .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, sits on table L. C . Last fall , on the sixth of September — I shall never forget the date — something strange happened to me . I put on an old suit I had n't worn for a long time , and as I picked up the waistcoat , a sovereign fell out . God knows how long it had been there . As I turned this sovereign over to look at it , it suddenly slipped through my fingers and rolled away . I looked and looked , but my sovereign was gone . I become nervous : I can n't find the sovereign . I search around for half an hour , three quarters of an hour , still I can n't find it . I get angry , I get furious . I shift the furniture — no sovereign . I call my man — we both look everywhere until it 's dark . I 'm perspiring and trembling — I have but one idea : I must get that sovereign back . Suddenly a suspicion comes into my mind — I get up from my knees . I scream at the top of my voice to my servant : “ You thief , you have found the sovereign and put it into your pocket . ” The man gets angry and answers me disrespectfully . I am about to strike him when I see the blade of a knife shining in his hands . I draw my revolver —<stage>Takes a shining revolver out of his pocket and rises .</stage>— and with this revolver I nearly killed a man for a sovereign —<stage>Look from KARL .</stage>— I did n't need and had never missed — just a found sovereign .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Puts revolver on table .</stage>

    <stage>Turns on couch from him .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>I would have given it away , but — it slipped through my fingers , and whatever slips through our fingers , that is just the one thing we want .<stage>Goes to KARL .</stage>We break our necks for it : that 's human nature . And if it once slips through your fingers , you will run after your found sovereign . And then , when it is too late , you will discover it was worth having .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>To draw a revolver for a found sovereign ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, sitting by him And that little woman will become dearer and more precious to you every day — you will realize that she could have given you wings — that her temperament , her beauty , her passion , would have been the inspiration of your work — all this you 'll realize when she has slipped away . You could have become a master — a giant ! Not by loving your art , but by loving her — but you wo n't know it till it is too late — too late .<stage>He now takes the shawl with which OLGA had draped her shoulders .</stage>This shawl has touched her bosom —<stage>Throws one end over KARL 'S shoulder , forcing him to see it . KARL clasps the shawl and touches his lips to it .</stage>Think what you might have been to one another ! What divine happiness , not because she is beautiful — no , but because you —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, throws shawl L. of couch Be quiet ! Be quiet ! Do you want to drive me mad ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, rises and goes to head of couch A life that has not been squandered — has not been lived —</p>

      <l>Why do you tell me all this ? Why ? What do you want ?</l>
<stage>Throws himself face down on couch .</stage>      <l>What do you want ?</l>
<stage>Horrified , turns to him .</stage>      <l>Who sent you ?</l>

     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, darkly Nobody ! No one ! I am here .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Touches KARL 'S forehead .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>No ! And a thousand times no .<stage>Throws himself face down again on couch . Screams very loud .</stage>No ! Do you hear me ? No ! I have known her all these years , and we 've been good friends only — and we 'll remain good friends , nothing else . I do n't want the found sovereign !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Moving to end of couch .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, coming down L. of couch ; very emphatically And if it slips away ?<stage>Silence . Then quickly :</stage>If another man runs away with it —?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, suddenly jumping at a conclusion Who ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Looks at the DEVIL .</stage>

     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, triumphant I .<stage>Silence .</stage></p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>You ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Laughs and turns from him .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Tonight ! This very night she 'll be mine !<stage>Laughs .</stage>Oh , what joy ! What exquisite joy . For ten thousand years I have had no prettier mistress !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, turning to him What do you say ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, sitting L. head of couch Mistress , I said . Come tonight — to her house — when the lights are burning — when the air seems to be filled with music and perfume . You 'll see — before day dawns .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Enough ! Enough !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>How you will run after your lost sovereign ! Every hour when you wonder where she is , she spends with me . A carriage passes : your heart stands still . Who 's in that carriage ? Shall I tell you ? We ! You see a couple vanish around a corner , clinging lovingly to one another . Who were they ? We ! Always we . A light goes out in some window . Who put that light out ? We ! We sit in every carriage , we vanish around every corner — clinging lovingly together ; we stand behind every window curtain in close embrace , looking into your tortured face , your maddened eyes — and we cling closer — closer — and we laugh — - we laugh !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Laughs long .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p><stage>Throws himself face down , back to audience , on couch , in terrible state of excitement , screaming at top of his voice :</stage>You fiend !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Reaches for revolver with R. hand . DEVIL grabs his hand and holds revolver . KARL draws away and sits staring straight ahead , DEVIL rises , leaves revolver on table , lights cigarette , then comes below table .</stage>
    <stage>HEINRICH enters the room noiselessly , carrying a lighted candle , goes behind the DEVIL and helps him to put his fur coat on .</stage>
    <stage>DEVIL puts his silk hat on , gives a tip to HEINRICH , takes up the revolver , puts it into his pocket , and says to KARL with a sad smile , in a warm tone like a father speaking to his son :</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>You see , my boy , one may draw a revolver for a lost sovereign .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>, interrupting To what ? To marry a man who is not madly in love with me — any more than I am with him . What of it ? We are two perfectly sane people about to make a serious contract with our eyes wide open , instead of blinded by infatuation like crazy lovers in magazine stories . What other contract made by crazy people would be valid for one minute — and this is for a life-time —</p>

     <p>You are a man of the world ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, gravely Of many worlds .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looks up quickly as if about to ask the DEVIL what he means , but checks herself and continues :</stage>Well , in this world — is it the man chooses the woman , or the woman who chooses the man ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, smiling We are the weaker sex .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>Answer me ! Which chooses ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>The man sometimes chooses the engagement ring —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>, holding up her head proudly , and looking her very prettiest , straight into his eyes Look at me , please .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The DEVIL looks into her eyes .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>, proudly Now tell me , can I or can I not choose the man I will marry ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, leaning on table R ., in a courtly manner It is written in your eyes — but — I never thought this subject would excite you so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>, seated L. of him , with animation I wo n't be laughed at — I do n't care what those people think<stage>becoming excited</stage>I know what I am doing , and in spite of everything I choose to become his wife .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, takes out little red satchel and opens it Why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>, beginning to lose control of herself Because — because —<stage>Breaks down .</stage>— because I love him .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Begins to sob bitterly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Allow me —<stage>Takes a little handkerchief out of the satchel and gives it to her .</stage>I always carry this with me — it 's my weeping satchel — everything a woman needs for weeping .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>, weeps a little harder ; sobbing , wiping her eyes with the handkerchief I love him .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>During the following dialogue the DEVIL takes out of the weeping satchel a little looking-glass , small comb , powder and puff , and gives her one after another .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>And this is Saucy Elsa !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>No . Until tonight I was a young girl afraid of nobody — now</l>
      <l>I feel like an old woman .</l>
<stage>Takes mirror .</stage>      <l>What am I to do ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <stage>Looks , smiles quickly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Do n't be discouraged . You will have to fight — you must attack the enemy . But first you must be pretty .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>, takes puff and powder from him I shall try to .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Reaches out for it .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>You must show a bold front — you will perhaps feel that it is hard for a young girl to fight a woman — your weapons are not quite so numerous as those of the married woman — who knows love already — who understands — may I say something shocking ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>During this speech ELSA hands back or the DEVIL takes all the articles except the handkerchief .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>, looks at him , opening her eyes widely Do you ever say anything that is n't ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Gives him handkerchief , rises .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Well , I wo n't . But remember , you have one weapon which will deal the death blow to the most attractive woman — to the woman who knows every card in the game of love — that one weapon is purity .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>This sounds strange from you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>All the same — it may do you some good . And now — go dance with Karl — but do n't try to be a woman , be a girl . Do n't try to be saucy .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>, L. C .</l>
      <l>I 'm not really saucy — I 'm afraid it 's only a pose —</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Do n't pose . Be yourself — be bashful — look at the young man as if you were only waiting for a pirate to steal you away from girl-land — and show you the way into Woman 's Land . Head high , my little girl — - that 's it — and if anybody dares to call you saucy again , tell him that you once met a gentleman at a ball to whom you thought to give a piece of your mind , that would make him feel very , very small — and instead you left with a piece of his mind , that made you feel very , very small — and made him feel — as if he were the greatest Scoundrel in the world —<stage>Taking a few steps to the footlights .</stage>which perhaps he is .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>ELSA goes up the stairs , when KARL appears on the top of the stairs , DEVIL is standing at this moment behind one of the columns unseen by KARL — but quite near ELSA . ELSA turns towards the DEVIL , showing her back to KARL .</stage>

    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, nearing ELSA You look lovely , Elsa . Do you know , this pensive air is very becoming to you — you 've always been so cold and — haughty — it 's like finding a little white flower under the deep snow ; you want to pick it up and kiss it —<stage>Takes both of ELSA 'S hands in his .</stage>This is the Elsa for me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>

    </sp>
    <stage>Sits R. of table L .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, sits on sofa L . A casual acquaintance who insists upon posing as my friend . Do n't let us talk about him . I 'm glad I found you here — something natural in this stifling artificial atmosphere . Does n't it seem close to you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>Yes , as if some hot wind had passed through these rooms — it seems to take my breath away .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>I 've never heard you speak like that before . Why have you tried to hide — your real self from me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DEVIL appears on the platform , with OLGA . They come down the steps .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Had n't we better leave the young couple alone ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>You are much too considerate .</p>

     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>What do we care ? Let 's be happy — Elsa ! I feel as if I had never known you before tonight .</p>

     <p>, moves chair so she can hide OLGA from KARL . DEVIL repeats business Why do you keep looking over there ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Oh , that 's only — I was quite unconscious —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They continue speaking slowly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Let 's talk about something else . You are very naughty . You have come here in spite of my —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, smiling Invitation . I would have respected your wish but for one very good reason — I made a bold wager this afternoon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>What ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>I made a bet that you would fall in love with me this evening .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Made a bet that I would fall in love with you ? And with whom did you bet ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Karl .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Karl ?<stage>Quickly .</stage>And what did he say ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>His answer was curious . I had better not tell you — I am afraid it would hurt you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>No , it wo n't . Please tell me .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Turns and looks at KARL .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, following her glance Well , perhaps later . Your little plan bids fair to succeed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, looking away quickly I had forgotten their existence .<stage>Changing quickly the conversation .</stage><stage>DEVIL pats OLGA 'S hands .</stage>You have fascinating eyes</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>During the following few words between ELSA and KARL , the DEVIL whispers into the ear of OLGA , stroking her hand gently in order to arouse KARL 'S jealousy .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>I never saw you look so charming .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>I feel as if I had changed , perhaps you have something to do with it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>You seem like a different woman this evening — there is something about you —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>It is because I am with somebody I do n't quite understand — but who seems to me a man in every sense of the word .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>This last a little louder , for KARL 'S benefit .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Your confession is charming . But I should be more ready to believe it , if you had n't made it .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DEVIL kisses OLGA 'S hand .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Our first love is generally our last , but our last love always our first — do n't you think so ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know . I 've never been really in love before — but have twice been disillusionized .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Love at first sight —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The following eight sentences are spoken very rapidly , almost at the same time .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, distraite You are right — for the first sight — that is to say —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p><stage>Now always looking at OLGA — OLGA always looking at KARL ; the DEVIL looking pleased , ELSA looking furious .</stage>Disillusions — well — yes , disillusions are — disillusions .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>I should hate to have to give an account of myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Yes , indeed — but , of course — it 's all a matter of taste .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>The way girls are brought up nowadays —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Exactly ! Our bringing up — that is — I mean to say — of course — of course .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>We must n't forget —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>I quite agree with you — if — if you know what I mean .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>, getting up quickly and slapping her hand on the table No , I do n't know what you mean .<stage>Crosses to stairs .</stage>Take me to the ball-room — I 'm engaged for the next dance .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>, also rising Well ,—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>, almost crying , insisting Let us go — I wish to go —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She goes towards the stairs ; KARL follows her , goes up side stairs , meeting her at the top as she passes OLGA .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Oh ! you are not in the ball-room .</p>
    </sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>You 'd better hurry , dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>I hate dancing , but I sha n't miss one single dance tonight , just to spite some people . I shall dance to the last step .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>ELSA looks at OLGA in a very impertinent way . OLGA steps forward as if to give a reply , when KARL comes between them ; offers his arm to ELSA .</stage>
    <stage>Exit ELSA and KARL up the staircase .</stage>

    <stage>Puts revolver back in pocket .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>

    </sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Oh ! Karl 's not a fool — he thinks the world of me . And you must have said things — but there is no doubt — that he and Elsa — like — perhaps love each other .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, very cold , leaning over chair at table L . Strange ! Your being so annoyed at the apparent success of your pet scheme .</p>

     <p>You think it will succeed ?</p>

     <p>How ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>This afternoon , when I told him I 'd make you fall in love with me , he wanted to shoot — that 's love — do n't talk to me about respect — and thinking the world of you — they may fire cannons out of respect , but pistols — no — that 's love every time .<stage>OLGA protesting silently as if the matter was not quite important enough .</stage>Of course , I know — this only interests you because it was you who planned the marriage , and after all you take a pride in the success of your scheme .

     <p>What then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Very simple . But you must take my advice unconditionally — ask for no reasons — do exactly what I tell you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, after careful reflection , slowly Y-e-s .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>I think I remember having seen you once at the Opera in a very beautiful cloak — fur — was it not ?— and cloth —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>With a long train ? You must put that cloak on — close it as high as you can — and wrap yourself in it as if you were feeling cold . Only show the tips of your shoes — then come back here —<stage>She starts towards him . OLGA looks at the DEVIL , as if she wanted to ask the reason .</stage>no questions .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, L. of pillar C . It 's all very , very mysterious , but when you look at me that way , I — I — can n't refuse ... your eyes seem to have all the world 's wisdom behind them .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>At once . And if anyone remarks on it , say you felt cold in the conservatory .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, doubtfully But suppose he says ....</p>
    </sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>But I will tell you . I 'm astonished at the change that has come over you since this afternoon . I admit it upsets me , but do n't imagine it is on Olga 's account — if you do n't mind , we 'll leave her out of the discussion .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>By all means .</p>

     <p>Do n't be absurd .<stage>Looking at floor as if his secret was discovered .</stage>Why should she run away from me —</p>

     <p>What do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>I mean , my dear Doctor — that you are not a gentleman .</p>

     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>I do n't quite follow you .</p>

     <p>When a gentleman would be discreet — he even conceals his discretion .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Very thoughtless of me — but since you have found me out — By the way , what you said about your marriage — is it settled ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, C . It is .</p>

    <stage>Crosses to settee L. and sits .</stage>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>No fear . What is it you want to tell me — tell me everything . I 'd like to learn some of the tricks of the trade . I may need them —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Tricks of the trade ? This from a man about to marry ? I 'm shocked .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, ironically You look it . What did you want to tell me about her ?</p>

     <p>About her ?</p>

    <stage>Indicating ears , eyes , mouth and forehead .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, concealing his pain very badly And to think — and this afternoon — at my house — was the first time —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, goes back of settee She 's a wonder ! believe me , Karl , she 's a wonder . It 's just possible she 's good — a dash of goodness wo n't hurt a pretty woman — but I hope not . I should then have to attribute my conquest to hypnotism — and that does n't flatter my vanity . What do you think ? We had agreed — just now when she ran away — ah —<stage>Checks himself</stage>So it was Olga !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Well , yes , it was — I hardly know how to tell you — It was a mad impulse . I proposed , just for fun , without the least idea she would take it up ; it means risking her reputation and social position — everything — not to mention the risk of catching cold —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DEVIL</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, startled What do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Well , this evening — before all her guests — there are a hundred and thirty I believe —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, impatient Yes , go on .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>— before the elite of Vienna I may say — she will walk through the ball-room on my arm — in<stage>suggestive pause</stage>— an opera cloak .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, not quite grasping it An opera cloak ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, suggestively That 's all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>You mean to tell me — she —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>She will be here in a moment — and then — before all Vienna — amid the bacchanalian ecstasy — of music , perfume , dancing — I will escort her through the ball-room like a classic goddess — like a modern Mona Vanna — in an opera cloak —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>You liar !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, apparently frightened But , Karl —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>It 's a lie . It 's a damnable lie .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>You tried to catch me — and I have caught you . You love this woman .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, L. C ., very loudly Yes , I love her . I have listened to all your lies — I have seen you as I 've seen a hundred like you — steal a good woman 's reputation and call it success , social success — and boast about it as you drag her in the mud . You have trapped me , it 's true — but you will suffer for it . It is my turn now — and I 'll put you out of this house , you blackguard — get out before I kick you out .</p>

    <stage>The DEVIL goes back slowly up the stairs . KARL is about to follow him up as DEVIL is on third step , OLGA comes on in her opera cloak and comes down stairs to R. The DEVIL goes behind her . KARL backs over L. Long silence , KARL stares at OLGA and the DEVIL , speechless .</stage>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Everybody is gay , the girls dance as if it were their first ball — the young men as if it were their last .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Strange ! that amidst all this gaiety Karl should be so sad .</p>

     <p>Sad ?</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>A splendid girl . Much too good for me — but marrying is something new to me — I want to try it . It is a sensation I have never had .</p>

     <p>You do n't seem very gay for a bridegroom .</p>

     <p>What do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>The way he seemed to look through me . It was almost as if he imagined — what did you say ? What did you insinuate ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Just what you are thinking .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>I intend to sit for my portrait — to do that , I must come every day .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>You intend to come here every day , and to do that you must have your portrait painted .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>You are clever at twisting words .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps you know there is another lady coming every day to have her portrait painted ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I know . That 's why I want mine painted — we 'll see which will be the better likeness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Come now — you must let me sit down — this time I want you to be right .<stage>Raises her and swings her in front of him .</stage><stage>DEVIL sits on couch , ELSA leans on table .</stage>Are you aware —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>This is awful — you question me like a judge .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>It is you who answer like a prisoner . Do you know that Karl is in love with Olga ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>, bitterly Do I know it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>And you still mean to fight ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I mean to fight — you gave me good advice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>That was yesterday .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>Well — this is to-day .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, impressively Yesterday was your winning day . Yesterday it was written that you , Elsa , would succeed in whatever thing you made up your mind to do , with the whole strength of your will .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>Last night I made up my mind to —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, interrupting gravely — to dance every dance —<stage>Pause</stage>You danced every dance .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>, defiantly Karl asked me to marry him last night .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>— and you refused .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>Yes — but to-day I shall —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>To-day is not your winning day — yesterday you chose — to-day you will have no choice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>I wo n't give him up — I can n't — I do n't know how .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>You will have to learn — let me see — I think I know some one who has learned the lesson and can teach it to you —<stage>Goes to hall door which he opens .</stage>Why , Mimi ! Why do you wait out there ? Come in here where it 's warm !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MIMI comes in — DEVIL seats MIMI C. He regards them both with a satanic smile — begins to hum a tune and exits L ., singing as he gets out ; he laughs — his laugh dies away outside .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>, sitting on small chair C. After a silence Are you waiting for the painter , too , Madame ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>, seated on couch Yes .</p>

      <l>Yes —</l>
<stage>Pause .</stage>      <l>He must have been on a spree last night .</l>
<stage>Smiling .</stage>      <l>When he goes on a spree he always sleeps late .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>, somewhat embarrassed Yes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>, making conversation Yes . If you have n't slept for a long time , then — you must sleep a long time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>Yes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Yes , Madame — I know all the ladies that come here —</l>
<stage>Quick look from ELSA .</stage>      <l>I 'm quite at home here — I 'm his model</l>
<stage>Explaining .</stage>      <l>I do n't pay for my portraits .</l>
<stage>Regarding ELSA .</stage>      <l>You have a splendid profile , Madame .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>You always say “ Madame ” — I am not married . My name is —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>, interrupting I know your name . I 've heard it often . You belong to a very rich family . I know what that means , I used to be well off , too . I was n't always obliged to work for a living .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>No ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>I was a chorus girl , but I had bad luck .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>I am so sorry for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p><stage>Silence .</stage>I know all about you and Herr Karl .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Rises , goes C .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>From whom ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>I know everything that goes on in this house . I told you I was his model — I sew on buttons and count the laundry .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Importantly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>Does the laundry-woman steal ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>No . But she uses strong blueing — I know everything Herr</l>
      <l>Karl thinks of .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <stage>Pointing at ELSA .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>, as if she was getting interested And does that interest you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>Yes , indeed it does . But that 's all over now</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>Why so ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>Because he is going to get married</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>But he will paint just the same — he will want models .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>Yes , but —<stage>Ingeniously .</stage>you know , when one has sewn on buttons — and counted the laundry — then to be — just a plain model — that hurts .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Goes up C .; ELSA crosses .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>And you like Herr Karl ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>, repressing her feelings Yes — I — I like him — he 's such a dear boy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>Does he paint you now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>, coming to head of couch ; sadly No . He only paints landscapes and — bank presidents .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>Then you did not come to pose to-day ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>A model always comes to pose . It 's tiring work , too , I can tell you — and if the artist wants to make love — it is n't her fault — and —<stage>Sighs .</stage>Oh , it 's such a rest .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>Oh , please .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Draws herself up stiffly , offended .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>Now I 've offended you — I ought to have known better — my people are all refined — I was n't born a model .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sorry I showed it — but — I — I 'm nervous to-day .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>, brightening Oh , I know what it is — I used to suffer dreadfully from nervousness when I was in the chorus .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>Come over here , Mimi ; I want to talk to you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>, goes over and sits on the couch You can talk to me about everything , I 'm not a bad sort , really I 'm not . I 've known all along about Herr Karl and — and you — he 's such a kind man . I was crying when I went away yesterday , and he felt sorry for me and he came to see me on his way to the ball — in his evening clothes — but I did n't receive him . If it 's over , it may as well be over .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>Was he fond of you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>I loved him , but what 's the use ? It 's like the railway — the station is there and the train comes and then the train goes away , and the station cannot run after it ; if the station is small , the train only stops a minute , and —<stage>Sighs .</stage>one must wait until another train comes</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>You loved him and can speak like that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I loved him , but it 's all over now . I was foolish to come here again when I 'd made up my mind I would n't , but now I 'm sensible again ; I 'll go away and try to forget him , I hope he will be — hap-hap — happy !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Begins to cry , looks for handkerchief in muff , but can n't find it . ELSA takes handkerchief out of “ weeping satchel , ” and gives it to her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>Poor Mimi ! Poor Mimi !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>, wiping her eyes with handkerchief , then returning it to ELSA . I — hope — you will be — hap — happy — too !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>I — happy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>You are going to marry Karl —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>No — no — I 'm not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>But it 's you he 's in love with —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>No , Mimi ; I 'm not the one — it 's some one else .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>You do n't mean Mrs. Zanden — it can n't be — why , she 's your friend .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>She was .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>I do n't believe it — it 's not love — it 's a madness — a —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>, jumping at the idea An infatuation ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>Yes , that 's it — he 's not in love with her — he 's not himself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>You think so ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>Yesterday he acted as if he were under some strange —<stage>Rises .</stage><stage>MIMI looks nervously behind her on both sides , ELSA follows her example .</stage>under some strange —</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The two girls look at each other in silence — - for what seems like a minute .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>Mimi , who is that man ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>, looks behind her again nervously I do n't know — I hate him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>, after looking behind her So do I .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They grasp each other 's hands across the table .</stage>
    <stage>A pause .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>, holding ELSA 'S hand I 'm glad I came , I feel better already for having seen you . I 'm going to be sensible now . I 'm going away — and I 'm never coming back !<stage>In altered voice .</stage>What time is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>It 's almost three o'clock .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MIMI</speaker>
     <p>Three o'clock ! Then I must hurry . I have an appointment at half past — he 's an illustrator — such a talented boy ; he 's just had a picture accepted by the Fleigende Blatter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELSA</speaker>
     <p>And you are posing for him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>Oh , yes ; but tonight he goes to the artists ’ dinner , and I have to find his dress studs , and iron a tie for him , and trim his cuffs .<stage>Makes gesture of cutting with scissors outside the edge of her cuff .</stage>Good-bye .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>No , no ; it is I who should ask forgiveness I was to blame . I lost control of myself . After what happened , I wanted to know — I wanted to make sure — but , you understand now , my letter has told you everything .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>What letter ?</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>Ah , pardon me , Madame , a thousand pardons , I quite forgot . The only excuse I can offer is that there are some letters which ought never to be delivered .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Takes letter out of his pocket</stage>

    </sp>
    <stage>KARL crumples up the pieces and throws them in the fire . As he does so , OLGA makes an involuntary movement with her hand as if to stop him , but he does not see it as his back is turned . The DEVIL sees it , however , and smiles</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>I sincerely regret if my forgetfulness has caused any inconvenience</p>

     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>My train does n't leave for an hour . Once more a thousand pardons .<stage>Crossing to C ., turning to both .</stage>If I could have foreseen what terrible distress the non-delivery of this letter ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, firmly You may be quite sure it contained nothing — er — nothing —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>At a loss for a word .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, looking at OLGA Nothing .</p>

     <p>I would have given anything in the world if you had not burned that letter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Why — you told — me —<stage>OLGA shrugs her shoulders as if to say , “ What can one expect of a man ? ”</stage>What does it matter anyway , whatever it is ? I would rather hear it from your lips .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, firmly No ! The letter is burned ; it is nothing but ashes — it is dead — no human power can bring it back to life .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>But , Olga !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>A moment ago I would have given all I possessed to save it from the fire — and now —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>What has happened ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>I can n't tell you . I only know I am glad — I 'm glad .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>OLGA here seems to have suddenly become composed , almost happy , as if something had been settled , though not as she had wished , still it is a relief .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, takes her hand Olga , do you mean you will never —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>, smiling I mean you will never know what was in that letter — it is as if it had never been written — it has ceased to exist , and we are past the day of miracles .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>, impatiently Miracles ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>No , no ! Only the devil himself would re-create that letter from its burnt ashes . Good-bye , Karl . I 'm going now — I sha n't see you again .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Shakes hands naturally .</stage>
    <stage>At word “ Devil ” the DEVIL enters silently from hall door . He has his fur coat on . He smiles wickedly , and at OLGA 'S words “ re-create that letter , ” pulls OLGA 'S letter out of his pocket , and stands so that the chair hides him from KARL and OLGA , who are close to studio door .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KARL</speaker>
     <p>Olga , you are afraid of something . What is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>I 'm afraid of — myself — good-bye !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>DEVIL</speaker>
     <p>, to OLGA I beg your pardon , I am so upset to-day —<stage>Holding out letter .</stage>I made a mistake — I gave you my tailor 's bill instead of your letter — here is your letter !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DEVIL gives the letter to OLGA , who snatches it from him in a frightened manner and tears it open . She recognizes her letter .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLGA</speaker>
     <p>Karl ! my letter ! I have my letter —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She runs into the studio .</stage>
    <stage>The DEVIL goes to the door of the studio , smiles diabolically , listens a minute at the door and rubs his hands as if he was very pleased with himself .</stage>
