     <stage>Time of day : Morning .</stage>
    </stage>
    <stage>Gertrude busy at breakfast-table .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Enters with Paul , from R .</stage>Confound it ! Everything seems to go wrong this morning !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Throws his cap on chair , angrily .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p><stage>Happily .</stage>Good-morning , papa !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Morning , my child . Such carelessness ! You ought to be ashamed of yourself . If this thing had happened earlier in the season , out on the meadows — but at this time of the year —!!! Oh ! Confound it all , anyway !!!!! It is inexcusable !! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>What is the matter , papa ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>The black cow has been overfed . But of course , when Marie is not about to look after everything , things go to rack and ruin . Well , man , what excuse are you going to make ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Paul</speaker>
     <p>None , Mr. Brauer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Now that 's the most sensible thing you have said this morning . Here , take a cigar and get to work ; but mind ! send for the veterinary surgeon at once . Have you had breakfast ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Paul</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Then what the devil are you waiting for ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Paul</speaker>
     <p>I — I — I wanted to excuse myself , and ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Impatiently .</stage>It 's all right ! it 's all right !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Paul</speaker>
     <p><stage>Remains — hesitatingly .</stage>G — Good-morning ! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Paul</speaker>
     <p>I — I have something else to tell you ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Then out with it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Paul</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a glance at Gertrude .</stage>But ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>H 'm ! Gertrude , darling , will you please see if it is still threatening rain ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Yes , papa !<stage>Goes out on the veranda .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Paul</speaker>
     <p><stage>Confidentially .</stage>The old hag has turned up again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Alarmed .</stage>Wha —— The devil you say ! H 'm ! Who — who has seen her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Paul</speaker>
     <p>She was seen begging in the village — and last night , one of my men observed her creeping stealthily around the sheds yonder .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Scratching his head .</stage>Yes , yes ! I had almost forgotten . She has served her last sentence — fully five years !— we have been free from her annoying presence and now , she has returned . Well , what does she want ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Paul</speaker>
     <p>She has heard her daughter is about to be married , she says .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Laughs .</stage>
      <l>Her daughter ? ha , ha ! I see ! no doubt she has learned of</l>
      <l>Gertrude 's betrothal . Well ? and ——</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Paul</speaker>
     <p>And so she has come to get her share of the wedding-cake — so she says ; but she dare not venture here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Well , I should advise her to keep a respectful distance . Take good care , Mr. Paul , that she approaches no one of this house . Do you hear ? No one . I will see the constable myself ; and perhaps we 'll soon get rid of her again . Good-morning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Paul</speaker>
     <p>Good-morning , Mr. Brauer .<stage>Exit .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p><stage>Enters .</stage>Shall I pour your coffee , papa ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>What ? My little one looking after the breakfast , eh ? Can you do all that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Oh papa ! if I could n't do even that ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>But Marie ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Oh , of course — not as well as she — you must have patience with me , papa !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Why certainly , my pet !<stage>Embraces her .</stage>And now , let me see — how many days are you left to me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Only four more days , papa .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Now , you rascal ! must you leave me ? must you go and marry , eh ? must you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>But papa , dear , it is all your own arrangement !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Of course , of course ! what is a poor old man to do ? Have you seen George this morning ?<stage>Gertrude shakes her head .</stage>Such sloth ! He does nothing but sleep , sleep , sleep .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>He worked until very late last night , papa . At dawn this morning I saw his light still burning ; and then it was past three o'clock .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I must admit , he is diligent and industrious — but also stubborn — damned stubborn .<stage>The last is said almost to himself . Aloud .</stage>Has mama been down ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>No , not yet .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>And Marie ? has she returned ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>She arrived by the early morning train .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>And how nearly finished is the lover 's nest , eh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Only one more trip to the city , I believe she said .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Well , and do you like the arrangement ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know , papa dear . I am kept entirely in the dark . It is to be a surprise to me . Oh , I will like it very much indeed , I think .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>And are you happy , my pet ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Oh , papa , dear , I sometimes feel as if I did n't deserve all this happiness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Well , my dear , a housewife who calls these soft-boiled eggs , certainly does not deserve such happiness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p><stage>Embarrassed .</stage>I only boiled them about three-quarters of an hour ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Ha , ha , ha , ha !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I beg your pardon , papa , I will ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>There , there , I was only joking ; never mind it . And Marie , I suppose , is taking her rest now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>If she only would do so . Papa , you must compel her to take a rest . No one can endure such a strain . One day she is looking after this house , and the next day she is in the city , furnishing our new home ; and the nights she passes on the train . I am sure she will break down .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Well , well , I will look after that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Enters from L .</stage>Good-morning !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Morning ! Well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p><stage>Throws her arms around her mother .</stage>Good-morning , mama dear !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Caressing her .</stage>My sweet ! my pet ! only four more good-mornings , and then ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>You must come to visit me soon , mama !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Crying .</stage>Visit ? ah , yes !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>No tears now , no tears , I beg of you ! Tears on an empty stomach — b-r-r-r-r-r , that 's poison .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>My darling , who dressed your hair last night ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>The housekeeper .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>There ! I knew Marie could not have done that . But do you know — Marie — a few moments ago I opened her door softly , to see how she was resting , and found her still fully dressed , just as she came from the train , seated at the open window , a book in her lap , and staring out into space .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Well , well , well ! I thought her passion for novels had passed away long ago .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>I 've been thinking — we must watch her more closely .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>She needs no one to watch over her ! She is well able to take care of herself ; but we must spare her ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>But , Henry , just now — three days before the wedding — who could think of sparing one 's self ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Well , you know — h 'm ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Henry , you know how I love the girl ; but , good gracious , she is not our own dear , sweet one ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Oh , she is more than that , mama dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>You are entirely too modest , my darling .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Well , just imagine , mama dear , she was going to be married — and I remained at home ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Then we would retain our sunshine , our consolation , our ——<stage>Looking at breakfast table with a questioning expression .</stage>But , children , I can n't understand ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>What , mama dear ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Gracious ! Everything is so — so —</l>
      <stage>Topsy-turvy indicated by action .</stage>
      <l>If she is not going to sleep , she may as well come down here ——</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laughingly caressing her mama .</stage>There , you see , mama , dear , not even a single meal can you eat without her .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>George von Harten enters .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Well , at last you have aroused yourself ; you ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p><stage>Interrupts him , tapping his hand .</stage>There , softly , softly , dear uncle ; do n't begin scolding so early in the morning .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Do n't you think it 's pretty near time to call me father , my boy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Not until after the wedding , dear uncle .— Good-morning , auntie .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Kissing her hand . ] Well , little one ? [ Kissing her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p><stage>Leans on him lovingly .</stage>My George .<stage>Laughs suddenly .</stage>Oh , just look ! he is simply covered with hay !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Then you may make yourself useful by brushing me off .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>The hayloft seems to be your favorite sleeping-place lately .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Sleep ? Heavens ! who could sleep in this weather ? I roam about . Lord knows where , over meadows and fields . Such St. John days !!! It 's enough to drive one mad . The days never seem to end . Late last night I was sitting in front of my window . Said I to myself : “ No sleep for me to-night , until that cursed nightingale runs out of melody ” — when suddenly a meadow-lark announces the break of day — and there , it 's morning . To the left , the twilight : to the right , the dawn , peacefully together . From glow to glow a new day arises . Children , I tell you , it was beautiful . Give me a cup of coffee .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>But , tell me ! Are you going to remain here now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Why , certainly , until after the wedding .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>But the propriety of such a thing ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p><stage>Imploringly .</stage>Oh , papa dear ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Its immaterial to me . Under no circumstances do I desire to offend your sense of propriety ; but then I will stay down at the inn , as the nearest place .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>And in the morning you will bring us the house full of fleas .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>But , Henry ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Well , it 's so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>If you will allow me ! The wedding was set for the twentieth ; therefore I obtained my first furlough from the nineteenth — and I trust you realize that I can n't change the dates to suit myself . I arrived on the twentieth — and the wedding , of course — it was postponed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>But , George dear , neither your home , nor anything else was ready .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>And besides , where am I to go ? My own home is broken up ; Marie has had everything torn up . By the way , has she returned ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p><stage>Nods .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Why , what 's the matter ? Have you two had another quarrel ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>No , certainly not ; but I should not have allowed the girl to make a drudge of herself for my sake . I almost wish I had remained at home .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Why , she is not doing all this for your sake , but for mine .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Now there , do n't be conceited .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Caressing her .</stage>I think she has cause to be conceited .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>As my future wife , she certainly has cause to be that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>There , there , do n't you overrate yourself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>I do n't , dear uncle ; I am too practical for that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>So , so , you are too practical , eh ? then what the devil possessed you to leave this piece of paper on my desk ? eh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Uncle , I beg of you , do n't let us begin quarreling so early in the day .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Angry still .</stage>Very well , but what does it mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>It is simply a statement of my affairs . I am a free and independent man , and that is to show you that I am not only willing but also able to properly support my wife .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Still worked up .</stage>But I tell you ——</p>

     <p>What is the matter , my child ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Mama , dear , I sat up all night in the train and have had no sleep at all .</p>

     <p>And how much longer will it take you ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Only one more trip to town ,— but pardon me , papa , the new assistant pastor is at the gate and ——</p>

    <stage>Gertrude snickers .</stage>

     <p><stage>To Marie .</stage>But what does he want ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>He says he does not wish to disturb the ladies so early in the morning , and asks you to please come out ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Nonsense ! tell him to come in .</p>

     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Gertrude , come here . Now remember , my dear , such conduct is not at all becoming to a full-grown young lady .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>My dear , sweet papa , I am so ashamed of myself — I — I 'll never do it again — never . But it 's so funny — ha , ha , ha ! he is gone on Marie ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>My dear , remember you are now a bride and it would be far more proper to say ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Smitten with her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Somewhat reproachfully .</stage>George !! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Sh , sh — silence !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>During following scene , Marie noiselessly clears off the table .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p><stage>Enters .</stage>I should not have dared to annoy the ladies at this early hour , if ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laughingly .</stage>Eight o'clock is not so very early in the country , my dear Pastor ; you will soon learn that here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>And how is the good old pastor ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p><stage>Doubtfully shrugging his shoulders .</stage>Well !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Alarmed .</stage>He is not worse , I hope ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>At the age of eighty , my dear lady , one cannot be said to be growing stronger .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Ah , I see , Pastor , you are somewhat of a philosopher . Will you take something ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>You are very kind . A good glass of brandy is half the morning sun .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Now that is a manly word , Pastor .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Oh ! thank you ! Your health !<stage>Drinks .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Will you take something , George ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>No thank you , uncle , not now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>When did you arrive , Pastor ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Just three weeks ago .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>And do you like our town ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Very much indeed , thank you . I find the whole world beautiful ; but the surroundings here are exceptionally so . Yes , this place to me seems doubly attractive , for here every one seems smiling and happy —— Pardon me . Miss , you have dropped the napkin .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Marie smilingly bows her acknowledgment .</stage>
    <stage>Gertrude exits , stifling a laugh .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Pastor , you will pardon this rudeness , she is still a child .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Oh , certainly , certainly ; for she is right . I have not yet been able to overcome my old tendency to play the gallant in the presence of ladies — and in this frock — I know — I must look somewhat ridiculous .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Tell me . Pastor , how did you happen to obtain this position ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Well , you see , that , too , is partly connected with this coat . There were four of us , classmates — who , after graduating , were eagerly awaiting the call to save the sinful world — and among them , myself the only one who was , what you might say , in fairly good financial circumstances . We were now and then compelled , first one and then the other , to present ourselves at the board of directors — and as a consequence my coat suffered severely . Now it really never fitted any one of my comrades and at my suggestion we finally purchased a coat , that came nearer fitting each of us , striking a happy medium , as it were , to every one 's satisfaction . Then , about four weeks ago , an ex-fellow-student — the curate of the cathedral — came to us , with this information : “ Ye holy men , list ye to me . In yon Lithuanian mountains lives a minister of the gospel , who , on account of his extreme age and feebleness , is incapacitated from properly performing his duties . And as there are four of you , I propose that you draw straws and leave it to chance who shall be the favored one . ” At that the others unanimously declared : “ No , he who has shared with us his clothing shall be the favored one ” — and — well , here I am and , I fear , not half as pious as I look .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Ah , courage , Pastor , courage ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Pray do not think that I am ashamed of my calling ; believe me , like our Lord and Master , my heart aches for suffering humanity , and therefore it has ever been my desire to follow in His footsteps . Besides , it was my father 's wish . You must know my father is a well-to-do farmer — there are no really large estates in the lowlands — but he has considerable — yes , I might say , a great deal of money — and owing to my early surroundings , I 'm afraid I am much better suited for a farmer than a minister of the gospel . But I will not give up , and continue to struggle and rid myself of all my bad habits . Your health !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Do you know , Pastor , I am beginning to like you ! Do you wish to remain here and take the old pastor 's place ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>I really would like ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Very well , my vote you shall have !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>You are very kind , indeed . With such a position I should be quite content , and to complete my happiness —— but , by-the-bye , the object of my visit was , really , the bridal-sermon . I am afraid our good old pastor will not be able now ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Ah ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Simultaneously .</stage>Will not be equal to the exertion , you mean ; ah — I feared as much .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Therefore , if you will allow me — unless you desired some one else ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Pastor , if we had not already heard you in the pulpit I would deny your request , point blank , as you are practically a stranger to us . But your ways and sentiments please me , and therefore — what say you , wife ?<stage>She nods .</stage>— And you , George ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I do n't know ; but unless I am very much mistaken , there is already a great deal of sympathy between us , eh , Pastor ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Now I must confess that is rather meaningless , at least so far as I am concerned ; for my sympathy extends towards the whole world .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>At any rate I am glad ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p><stage>Jestingly .</stage>Then will you kindly leave us for awhile ? I desire to inquire into your past record .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p><stage>Shakes his finger laughingly .</stage>With pleasure , if you promise not to be too severe on me .<stage>Exit .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Now , then , with your kind permission , I will take a few notes ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Certainly , Pastor !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>This young gentleman , your nephew , is especially close to the family , is he not ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Correct !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Pardon me , but may I ask in what way ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>I will tell you . Pastor . It was in the year ‘ 67 , when we had here in East Prussia , a terrible drought — a year of distress and — do you remember anything about it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Very little , as I was then still quite young .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Ah , it was terrible ! Potatoes and fodder rotted before ripening . Of wheat and rye hardly a trace . We farmers , I tell you —! Then it was , when my brother-in-law , the husband of my sainted sister , whose estates were in the neighboring township yonder , realized one day his financial ruin and with all his aristocratic pride — you understand — he saw no other way — he resorted to the pistol — he committed suicide .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>And the — your sister , still lives ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Thank God , no ! but from that day ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Pardon the interruption ; but I have heard your daughter , Miss Marie , called “ the calamity child ” by some of the villagers . Has that any connection with this year of distress ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>And you did n't know that , Pastor — how she came into our house ? Well , during that same terrible winter , we were returning one night , my husband and myself , from the town , where we had at our own expense erected a soup-kitchen — when suddenly , at the corner of the woods yonder , where the road makes a sharp turn , our horses shied — and there , in the middle of the road , we saw lying , a woman , with a child pressed closely to her bosom . She refused to stir and begged us to put her out of her misery . Of course , we took her into the sleigh at once — ah , she was in an awful condition ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>I tell you , Pastor , it was months before we could rid the blankets of vermin .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>And the child , the poor little thing ——! But after being bathed and fed , and lying there , between the clean white covers , we both stood over its bed — the little thing , with its pinched face , laughed at us and stretched out its tiny hands — my husband said to me : “ Wife , I believe this is our share of all this sorrow and misery that heaven has sent us . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>For you must know . Pastor , that our own daughter , Gertrude was then not yet born .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>No , not until three years later . Well , we bought the child from that miserable , drunken woman , in proper , legal form — determined and glad to get rid of her , for she did smell so of gin , I could not endure it any longer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>That is what the worst drunkards in these parts prefer to brandy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Unfortunately !! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>But to come back to my nephew ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Pardon me , another question . What became of the mother ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Ah , that is a bad story — and just to-day ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Yes ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Oh — nothing , nothing . Anyway — that woman really did return , and as we did not want the child to see her , we gave her more money . Of course she remembered that and so finally she became a positive plague .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Henry , I have often thought since , perhaps a mother 's heart prompted her ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>You think so , eh ? Then perhaps a mother 's heart also prompted her to steal at the same time ! for every time she honored us with a visit , something or other disappeared , until I grew suspicious , had her watched , she was caught red-handed — and , of course , a long term in prison was the result .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>And the girl — does she know or suspect anything at all ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>We told her , her mother was dead . But one day she really did see her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>How did that misfortune happen ?</p>
    </sp>

     <p>It was on her confirmation day , just as the girls left the church in a body , when we heard a cry . What had happened ? Why , that woman had been lying in wait for the procession ; when suddenly she appeared , seized her child , and kneeling before her in the road , passionately covered her hands and feet with kisses .</p>

     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p><stage>Shuddering .</stage>Horrible !!!!! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>I tore the child from her arms , of course , and carried her into the house . We had to make some kind of an explanation ; a drunken vagabond , I told her ! Did she believe it ?— H 'm ?— Then she fell ill ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>And how is it now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Humorously .</stage>Why , Pastor , you seem very much interested .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p><stage>Enters . Gertrude follows him in .</stage>I presume I am pretty well done by this time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>We have n't even started with your case . The pastor is interested in something of far greater importance .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p><stage>With meaning and moved .</stage>You must not believe that , Mr. von Harten ; but there are lives whose fates are surrounded by so much mystery ——<stage>with a glance at Marie , who enters L. with package of linen .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p><stage>Who follows his glance .</stage>Yes , yes , you are right .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>If you will allow me , I will call again about the sermon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Giving him her hand .</stage>Pastor , you know you are always welcome in this house .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Give my regards to our good old pastor . Towards evening we will see him , as usual .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I had almost forgotten ! He desires me to ask you kindly , should you again favor him with eggnog , to please add a little more sugar , for the last was a trifle tart .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Why , of course , the poor old soul .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Do not say that , madame ; for when the time has come when all our wishes and hopes and desires are concentrated upon a small quantity of sweets , our sufferings are near the end . And now , adieu . Miss Marie , adieu .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Preoccupied .</stage>Adieu .</p>

    <stage>Pastor exits , accompanied by Brauer .</stage>
    <stage>Gertrude enters .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Do n't be afraid dear , no one will scold you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Oh mama , I 'm so ashamed of myself . When he arrived he seemed so jolly — and now — I am sure he is offended .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>He was not offended , dear , only a little grave .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>At any rate , what do you think of him , Marie ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Glancing up from her work , sorting linen .</stage>Of whom , mama dear ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Why , the new pastor .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Oh mama , my mind is so occupied , I had n't given him a thought .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p><stage>Aside to George .</stage>Now you tell her , George .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Gertrude , how about our manzanillo-tree — any blossoms this morning ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>You do n't mean to say you have n't looked after that beloved tree of yours this morning ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>I have had no time , mama dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p><stage>To George .</stage>Now tell her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Marie , both Gertrude and myself insist , that you cease this endless drudgery for our sakes ; it is n't right .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Marie , humming , pays no heed — looks into space .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>See , she is not even listening .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>What 's that you are singing ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>I —? Was I singing ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Well then , humming .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Oh yes , last night at the station I heard a strange song — some one in a fourth-class coach was singing . Listen .<stage>Sings .</stage>“ Zwirio czenay , zwirio tenay — kam'mano bernyczo — Rid wid wil dai dai — Ne'r mano bernyczo . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>And the Lithuanian text — you memorized it just from hearing it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Certainly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Well , where did you learn all that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Why , I have always known it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>And could you translate it readily ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Oh , it means nothing , really —<stage>makes one or two attempts .</stage>— “ here ” — no ! “ I look here and I look there — where may be my lover ? Rid wid will dai dai — Nowhere is my lover ! ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Enters during this , unseen by her , puts arms around her . She shrieks .</stage>There , there —<stage>caressing her .</stage>Patience , my darling , some day you will have one — perhaps very soon . Why , what 's the matter , dear ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Leans on him in tearless sobbing .</stage>Oh , you have frightened me so !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>What is the matter with you this morning ? What has happened ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>I have already told you , nothing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Tut , tut ! something has gone wrong ! I can see it — and now , I demand that you tell me the truth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Well , then — yes !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>What is it ? Come , come , out with it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Some one attacked me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Attacked you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Not far from here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>As you came from the station ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Well , I never — but everyone around here knows you and your character ; how did he look ? was it a vagabond ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hesitatingly .</stage>N — No . It was — a gentleman ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Did he lay hands on you , or even try to touch you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>But you say he attacked you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Attacked me — yes !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>You mean he followed you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>How far ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>As far as the gate , which I opened quickly and then he disappeared .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>To the others .</stage>Now , what do you say to that ?<stage>George shrugs his shoulders .</stage>There is something queer about it all .<stage>To Marie .</stage>And that is what upset you so ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I am already much composed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Raises her head .</stage>Yes — you look it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Oh , papa , do n't torment her so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Now , then , go and take a good nap .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Not yet , papa dear , I can n't . I must speak with George first . About the large bookcase — I really do n't know where to place it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>But you can do that later , can n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>I fear I might forget it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Very well ; I am going down to look after the cow . Will you come , wife ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rising and putting up her handwork .</stage>Yes , dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>To Marie .</stage>And one thing more ,— do n't you put your foot outside of the gate without an escort hereafter ! Understand ? Not once !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>But why not , papa dear ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>After what has happened ? But I never heard of such a thing — never , as long as I ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>But , Henry , in broad daylight , it is hardly necessary ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>No matter ; I have my reasons for that ; besides — well , I 'll tell you later .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>In passing taps Marie on cheek .</stage>Now , pet , go and take a good rest .<stage>Both exit .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>You must go , too , Gertrude !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p><stage>Peevishly .</stage>But why should I ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>You know , dear , your future home ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Ah , yes ; those stupid furnishings ! Do you know , I do n't think a wedding half so much fun as Christmas . Now do n't be long , will you ?<stage>Exit .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Pause .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Why so deep in thought , suddenly ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>I —? Oh , I was thinking . I was picturing to myself that cosy little nook , your corner room !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Marie , dear , how can I ever thank you for all the ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Do n't speak of it , George , for I take great delight in having the furniture moved about ; and then , I say to myself : “ Here is where they will take their tea , and there they will while away their leisure hours ” — so —— But , what I meant to tell you ! Yesterday we had an accident — the large mirror in the parlor was broken . I know it portends ill ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>What care I , so long as our friendship will not be broken .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>But why should it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>It shall never be my fault , Marie .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Certainly never mine . But what I wanted to say ,— I had the large mahogany bookcase repolished . Is that satisfactory ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Anything you choose to do is satisfactory to me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hesitatingly .</stage>And then — I must tell you , George , something important . When I unpacked the bookcase , I found a blue manuscript .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p><stage>Unsuspecting .</stage>What kind of a manuscript ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>George , you must not leave that lying around — not even hidden behind the books , especially now , when you take your wife to your home .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>In heaven 's name , what manuscript ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>I believe — it contains some poems ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>You believe — it contains some poems . I have missed it since early last winter ; I thought I had lost it . Marie , now tell me truthfully , have you read its contents ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>N — no !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Then why do you tell me not to leave it around ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Well , I read the first part , and had begun on the second , when I concluded to go no further .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>And you really looked no further than the first ? Absolutely no further ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Can you swear to that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>I can !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Then swear !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>I swear ! Are you satisfied ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Yes , thank heaven ! But you must not imagine for a moment that the book contains anything I am ashamed of ; on the contrary , I consider it so sacred I would not have it desecrated by a stranger 's eye . About four years ago , something occurred within me — within my soul . No one knows — no one could even guess , and no one shall ever know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>No one ? Not even I ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>No , not even you . But where is the book ? Give it to me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Turns up stage and takes it from her bosom .</stage>Here it is .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>How shall I ever thank you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>I want you to do me one favor . Will you promise me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>If it 's in my power , certainly !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Then I must first confess to you . A few moments ago , when papa questioned me , I deceived him . I was attacked last night — yes — but not by a man , but by a woman — a Lithuanian woman . George , that woman was my mother !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>But I understood your mother was dead .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>No , no ; that is not so . Not one of you ever told me the truth . On the day of my confirmation I was waylaid by that very same woman — I cannot have been mistaken .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Come , tell me , how did it happen ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>I was walking along quietly — ‘ twas already dawning — when suddenly a gaunt form arose from the ditch beside the road . I looked , and saw before me a miserable beggarwoman , who called out to me in a trembling voice : “ Marie — Madame — Daughter ! ” I turned cold in fear and horror , and , unable to utter one sound , I began to run ; and I ran , ran , ran , and behind me I only heard her agonizing call : “ My Marie — my daughter ! ” And so , I ran away from my own mother . And now , after a few hours ’ thought , I realize I did wrong . I must see her and speak to her , and learn from her own lips who and what I am ; and as papa has forbidden me to leave this house — I would go in spite of him , but I have a fear — I beg of you , George , dear , go to her , I implore you , find her for me — she cannot be far away , and ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>And then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Then bring her to me , into the garden , or , better still , into this room towards evening , when papa and mama are calling on the old pastor ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Marie , I cannot do that !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>The first time I ask a favor of you — and you say you cannot do it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Marie , dear , listen to me ! You have been so kind to me of late — and that has not always been so ; but if you had sacrificed for me even more than your own comfort and rest , I — I could not do it — I could not deceive your father and mother , for I fear the consequences .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Then can n't you understand that , a foundling though I am , a desire might come over me to see my own mother , though she be but a common beggar and an outcast ? That I might want to lay my head on her shoulder and be petted and fondled , and cry myself to sleep on mine — on my own mother 's breast ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Are you not fondled , are you not petted — has mama not always been kind to you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Yes , but it is not the same — not the same . Never have I felt the desire , the demand within me for my own flesh and blood , as just now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>But why just now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Imploringly .</stage>Because my heart is bursting . Oh , George !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>I cannot . I dare not do it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Then you refuse me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>You know I must ! !</p>
    </sp>

    <stage>Marie , seated , with some linen in her lap , at the sewing-machine , looking dreamily out of the window .</stage>

     <speaker>Housekeeper Katie</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>In door R .</stage>
      <l>May I come in , Miss Marie ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Oh , is that you ? Yes , come in !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Katie</speaker>
     <p>I see you are working on Miss Gertrude 's wedding outfit . How beautiful , fit for a princess . But what I wanted to ask you : Madame has given me the menu for the wedding feast , and as to fish , it calls for carp . Now you know I am economical , but carp — common carp ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Why , carp is a very fine fish ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Katie</speaker>
     <p>Oh yes , and good enough for — say — your wedding feast ; but not good enough for Miss Gertrude .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>For my wedding feast even carp is too good .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Katie</speaker>
     <p>Oh no ; carp is not too good for you , though it may be good enough — and do you know I will prepare a special Polish sauce — but Miss Gertrude — she must have deep sea fish . Now will you see Madame about that , please ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Very well , I will speak to mama about it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Katie</speaker>
     <p>And you are not offended ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Oh no !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Katie</speaker>
     <p>For , after all , you know , you are only a foundling .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Oh yes , I know .</p>

     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Thank you . But have you seen Mr. von Harten this morning ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Katie</speaker>
     <p>No , I have not ! But I have some good news for you — the assistant pastor has fallen deeply in love with you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Yes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Katie</speaker>
     <p>And he is going to ask for your hand !!! I always said you were a lucky girl . Just think , you may be a St. John'shYpppHeNbride .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>And what is a St. John'shYpppHeNbride ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Katie</speaker>
     <p>You do n't know that , Miss Marie ? Well , I 'll tell you . It is written in the new seal of Solomonis : “ Whoever shall give or receive their first kiss on St. John 's eve , their love is sealed and they will be faithful unto death . ” So it is written in the new seal of Solomonis .</p>

      <l>Now what is it ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>The tulip-tree ! the first blossoms from our manzanillo-tree ! It blooms — it blooms !! !<stage>Burying her face in the flowers .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Are you glad , Marie ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Yes , darling , so glad !!! Thank you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>And do you know who picked them ?— George !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>For me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Why , of course , for you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>He — did this — for me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>He would do even more than that for me , I am sure !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Oh yes , certainly ! But where is he now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Did he say he had to go somewhere ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Yes , he had to go out on the fields , he said — and that was quite some time ago . I wanted to accompany him , I begged and begged , but he flatly refused to let me go .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Breathing heavily .</stage>Oh !!!!!!! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know how it is ; but to-day he is acting so strangely . Papa has asked for him several times — and do you know , dear , at times he is not at all pleasant to me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>But why should he ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>That 's just it ! why should he ? Oh , if I only knew — if I was only certain he loved me — and then , another thing — I do n't know if I should tell you — I have a growing fear , some other girl will take him away from me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>With forced laugh .</stage>Away from you , dear ? how could that be possible ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Oh yes , you may laugh ; but at times , when he looks at me , I see a strange look come in his eyes . Half affection — half pity — and I do n't want to be pitied ! Why should he ? Am I not happy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Caressing her .</stage>Yes , dear ; you ought to be very , very happy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>But I cannot rid myself of the fear , perhaps he really loves another and is only taking compassion on me ! Oh , if I only knew ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>But , my darling ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>For you see , I am still so young — and think , how ill-mannered I was only this morning ! I was so sorry afterwards — but I do love to laugh .<stage>Laughs .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>With strange y desperate tone of voice .</stage>And you shall laugh — laugh — laugh — so — so !!!!!! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Mama , too , insists that my love for him is only that of a child and not of a woman and a bride ; but you see she would rather I 'd not marry at all and so remain at home with her all my life . But you will be good to her , wo n't you ? You will soon be her only one .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>I ——?</p>

     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Why yes !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>I shall soon know whose only one I am !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>What are you saying ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>As George enters .</stage>There he is !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Gertrude runs towards him . Marie takes a few steps , then hesitates and stops .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Pulling him , as she runs towards him .</stage>
      <l>Oh , George !! !</l>
      <stage>Then</stage>
      <l>Confound you !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p><stage>Reproachfully .</stage>Gertrude !!!!! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p><stage>Crushed .</stage>Why , what did I say ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p><stage>Lovingly .</stage>Now listen to me , little one . Such language may be excusable in your papa , but never in my bride .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pouting .</stage>Everything I say seems to displease you . You never find fault with Marie ! You can go and marry her !! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Marie does not want to marry me .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>My very best thanks , George !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>For what ?</p>
    </sp>

     <p><stage>Picking up bouquet .</stage>For this !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Oh , do n't mention it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Were you out in the fields ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Yes , papa is angry with you , too . He is looking for you !</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Oh yes — I know ——! Well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>In what direction did you go ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>I have been everywhere .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>And have you found ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>What was he to find ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Yes , what was I to find ? But , children , your tulip-tree is certainly a strange fellow . There he stands , blooming alone , like the last rose of summer ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>My great-grandfather brought it from South America !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p><stage>To Marie .</stage>And that is why you love it so , because it is so foreign and strange ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Busy with linen .</stage>Perhaps !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>No , that is not the reason ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Well then , what is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>I 'm going to tell on you . One day papa took her to the Opera , down in the city ; there they saw the African ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>“ L'Africaine , ” you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes , that 's what she called it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Gertrude , please do n't ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>In that play occurs a poison-tree — I think ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Yes , a manzanillo-tree !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes ; and whosoever inhales the odor of its blossoms must die . And do you know what she did ? Oh , yes , I did the same — we would go to this tree , smell of its blossoms , and lay down ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>To die ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>To die .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Now you can imagine , George , how long ago that must have been .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Yes , it was long , long ago . But about four years ago , one day Marie really wanted to die very badly .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Marie casts a frightened glance at George , who returns it thoughtfully .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>But we did n't .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>No , no , thank heaven . Now , little one , run along and tell papa that I am here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Marie , will you come , too ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>No ; I think I will remain here a little while longer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Then I 'll stay , too .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Now , little one ——</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Gertrude exits with a sigh .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quickly and suppressed .</stage>Did you find her ?<stage>George nods .</stage>Will she come ? Why do n't you answer ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Marie , when you exacted this promise from me this morning , I did not realize what it meant . I had never seen your — I do n't want to speak that word — I had never seen this person until to-day . She must not come to this house , secretly — she must not !! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>George !! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Take uncle into your confidence , at least .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>No , no one — no one but you ! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>What do you want with her ? You know you belong to this house . Here you have everything your heart desires . Here you have love — here you have ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Interrupts him .</stage>Bread ! Why do n't you say it ? Yes , here I have bread !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>I did not mean to say that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>No ; but I did ! And do I not earn it , as well as the little love I obtain in this house ? I am “ The Calamity Child ” — and I do not ask for charity .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>You seem to be possessed of the very devil to-day !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>I implore you , do not insist . I fear the consequence . You will see ! for whatever is done against nature , punishes itself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>And is it against nature when a child cries out for its own mother ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>She is not your mother ; your mother is in this house .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Gertrude 's mother is in this house , not mine . A mother must feel for her child , she must see ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Sh — sh !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Enter Gertrude .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>You two are continually talking in whispers ; can n't you tell me ? It makes me so unhappy !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Caressing her .</stage>But darling , it is all done for your sake !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>During this , George looks at her disapprovingly , while Marie casts a timid glance at him .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Enters .</stage>At last you have come . Where in thunder have you been all day ? It almost seemed to me as if you were trying to avoid me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>But , uncle ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Well , girls , have you prepared the pastor 's eggnog ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I had entirely forgotten it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Then see to it at once . And do n't forget the sugar , you know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Yes , papa .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>And Gertrude dear , you can go and help her . It is time you were learning to do something yourself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Yes , papa !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>I hardly think it will be ready in time to take with you and mama .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Then bring it later — yourself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a glance at George .</stage>Could not Gertrude bring it , papa ? I have so much work to do !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>No , no , papa !! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes , you shall !— bring it up when done ; and mind , you remain at the pastor 's as long as your mother and I , this time . Understand ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Oh , papa dear ! The last time , the old pastor insisted upon holding my hand in his so long ; and they are so cold and clammy , so shriveled and hairy , like the hands of the dead !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Come here , my child . Those hairy hands once christened you , and at your confirmation the same shriveled hands were laid upon your head and invoked for you the blessings of heaven ; and would you , after all that , refuse to hold them in your own warm young hands ? My daughter , I do not wish to hear that again .<stage>Kisses her .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Slowly has approached George . Softly , aside to him .</stage>You will do as I ask ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>And now , leave us .</l>
      <stage>Marie and Gertrude exit .</stage>
      <l>“ Now , then , comes your turn , ” says the stork to the worm .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking after the girls , turns .</stage>I suppose so , but take a care , uncle , I am not so easily digested .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>We shall see ! We shall see !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>What do you want with me ? My financial condition is satisfactory . I have a good position , and my future is assured . I desire to enjoy the results of my own labors , not those of yours .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>So , so !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Yes , dear uncle . If you were so determined upon giving a large dowry , you should have found another husband for Gertrude than myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Riled .</stage>Oh , hang you and your confounded pride !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I am proud ; and because of my pride and determination , and , I may say , defiance , I have become what I am !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rather arrogantly .</stage>And was there no diligence ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>That , also , was nothing but defiance .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>I almost believe you are determined to create another rumpus , as you did twelve years ago .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>If necessary , yes !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>And was it necessary , even then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>You ask me that question ? When one day I came here , during vacation from college , you insisted upon my attending your church . I refused . You gave me my choice , either to do as you asked , or have my allowance cut off . Then I resolved in my mind never to comply with your command , in spite of everything . Oh , it is no pleasure to hunger , as I was forced to do then ; but you may believe me , as I stand before you now , a free and independent man , I owe all of it to my stubborn confidence in myself , looking neither to right nor left , but straight ahead , without concessions , without falsehoods , always able to look every man straight in the face . And this good conscience is my proudest possession . From it do I draw all my strength , and I will never give it up .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Well , who the devil asked you to give it up ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>And one thing more . Of course , I belong to this house ; fate has made it my lot . Therefore it has ever been far from my mind to seek a wife elsewhere , so strongly attached do I feel myself to this house ; and that would have been impossible , had I not from that day been a free man . And now , dear uncle , you are at heart a good and kind man ; but your hand is heavy , and it must not lie upon me again as that of the master . For that reason do I refuse to touch even one penny of the dowry , now or any other time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>So , so ! Then you are really afraid of me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Afraid of you ? Bah !! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>And at heart you are nothing but a coward ! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Uncle , I forbid you ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>You forbid me ? Ha ! This is my house , and here I am the master !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>George shrugs his shoulders .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes ; it seems to annoy you to have any one keep an eye on you and your conduct ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>My life has been as an open book to this day .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>But after to-day — what about that ? Who can look into the future ? Who can look into your heart and read your thoughts ? Who knows what may happen over night , eh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Uncle , these are insults I will not endure , even from you ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Well ! What then ! Come on !<stage>Jumps up , facing him , ready to fight .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Enters , ready to go out , dressed .</stage>Henry , what on earth have you done to Gertrude ? She is in her room , crying as if her heart would break .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Marie has also come in with Mrs. Brauer .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>How is the eggnog getting on , Marie ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>It is not quite done , papa !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Then let her have her cry ; she can bring it up later .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Yes , papa .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>And are you ready ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Ready for what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Are you ready to go now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Well , wait for me out on the veranda ; we have something to settle first , we two !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>What 's the matter with George ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I have just asked him for an explanation , and that does not seem to please him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Caressing him .</stage>Do n't you mind him , George dear . After the wedding you can laugh at him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Well , we shall see about that !! !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Mrs. Brauer and Marie exit .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>We can n't go on like this , for I fear the consequences ; but , nevertheless , I shall handle you without gloves .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>My child loves you . You are her ideal , her all , and the wedding must take place . But tell me , what right have you to all this pride — I might even say arrogance ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Must I perhaps ask your permission ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>That is the same old defiance , the same unreasonable stubbornness of your father 's !!!! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p><stage>Starts .</stage>My father has been dead these twenty years — what do you want of him now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>What do I want of him ? That he left you to me , to bring up from childhood , I will hardly mention ; although that ought to be sufficient to temper your untamable pride — at least towards me ; but ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Uncle , you may abuse me as much as you please , but my father I will not have disturbed ! My father — you shall let him rest in peace !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>And who was it — who took care — who made it possible , that he could rest in peace ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Uncle , what do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Well then , who was it , when he laid there , dead , before us , who paid his debts of honor and saved your father 's name from disgrace ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Pause .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Uncle , you should not have said that !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Sinks in chair and covers his face with his hands .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>My boy ——<stage>Emotion stops him from saying more — walks about .</stage>See here ——<stage>Again the same — tries to light a cigar , breaks it and throws it away .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>You should not have said that , uncle ! No , no ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>My God , you knew of it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I knew of it , and yet you should not have said it ; you should not have repeated it . Twelve years ago , in our quarrel , when you raised your whip to me — and I reached for the carving-knife — no , no — I should not have done that . You should not have raised your whip , nor I the knife . That is the reason I refused anything from you at all . Now you know it . From that day I swore to scratch the gold from the ground with my finger nails and fling it in your face . From that day I hated you — and rightly so !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>And all that because I saved your and your father 's name from dishonor and disgrace ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>No ! But because you turned that same deed into a weapon to crush my youthful pride .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>My boy , one uses the weapon nearest to hand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p><stage>Bitterly .</stage>Even if it is only a whip . But then , I see my mistake . I have no right to pride ; my fatherly inheritance does not permit it . Give me your gold ! I 'll take it ! All — all !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>No , no ; in your present state of mind I will force nothing on you . You might again turn to hating me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Ah no , dear uncle , that is past . Hereafter , I will swallow my pride .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>My boy ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Enters .</stage>Pardon me papa , but mama asks , if you are not yet ready to go ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a glance at George .</stage>Well , as far as I am concerned , I am ready now !<stage>Takes his hat .</stage>Marie , give him a glass of brandy to brace him up .<stage>Goes to door and returns .</stage>George ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Uncle ?<stage>Brauer offers his hand .</stage>My hand I cannot refuse you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Goes to door . In door .</stage>Yes , and your heart , too , I will win again — or I 'll be damned !!! !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Exits , slamming door .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>What did he say to you , George ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Do not ask me , do not ask me !<stage>Walks about .</stage>All these years I have struggled and deprived myself with only one thing in view — to be free — free — and yet I must bow — I must bow . If it were not for the sake of this beautiful child , who is innocent of it all , I would be tempted to —— But the die is cast , the yoke is ready — and so am I !!!!!! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Softly and hesitating .</stage>But , George , dear , here in this house , I see nothing for you but love — the yoke seems so light ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>How pious and tame you have suddenly become !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>I am not pious .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>What was that you said a few moments ago ? “ I am the calamity child . I am the child of misery ; but I do not ask for charity . ” That is what you said of yourself , and it is also true of me . I , too , am a child of misery , a calamity child ; but I am a subject of charity . I accept all they have to give — all — all — ha , ha , ha ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>You , George , a calamity child ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Yes ! Was I not picked up from the street , as my uncle so kindly informed me for the second time — like yourself ? Do I not belong to this house , and am I not smothered with the damnable charity of my benefactors , like yourself ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>I receive my share with thanks .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>And you enjoy serving ——</p>

     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>And you shall rule — you shall command ——</p>

     <p><stage>The same .</stage>Pardon me ; but have you forgotten —?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I see !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>I know it is wrong in me to annoy you at this time , when you are so occupied with affairs of your own —— Besides , you have already refused me once ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Wha — yes , now in spite of them all , I am my own master . I am responsible to no one . I have promised you — I shall keep my word !!!! !</p>

     <p>Thank you , George !</p>

     <p>My God ! Do not keep her waiting any longer ; call her in here .</p>

     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Marie , for your own sake , I warn you for the last time ; discovery means certain disaster .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>One disaster more or less , it matters little !</p>

     <p>Very well .</p>

    <stage>Exit R .</stage>
    <stage>Marie goes out on veranda — gives sign — returns — locks doors R. and L .— then at C. door — in terror , with searching eyes , she slowly retreats backwards , her eyes glued on the outer darkness — until she finally covers her face with her hands , and is standing against the wall .</stage>

    </sp>
    <stage>While Marie turns to sideboard , she quickly takes two or three pieces of linen and with left hand holds them hidden under her apron .</stage>

     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Yes , you know , you know all ! Now I have no one in this whole world but you — you alone .<stage>As she bursts out crying she throws herself on his breast .</stage></p>

     <p>And we will ever remember this day — the day that brought us together . It is the day before St. John 's Eve . Will you remember it , dear ?</p>

    <stage>Short pause . Marie silent , then struggles to free herself .</stage>
    <sp>

     <p>Do n't , George ! Go away ! Please do n't !</p>

     <p>Go , George , I beg of you ! I must lay the table !! Now go !</p>

     <p>Marie , you said yourself you had no one but me !</p>

     <p>If you do not want to despise me , please go ——</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Now , then , tell Marie to bring the bowl !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Ah ! you are going to have a bowl ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Why , of course , Pastor . This is St. John 's Eve . The villagers will set off tar-barrels and bonfires , and we will celebrate it with a bowl .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Mischievously .</stage>But perhaps this festival is too heathenish for the clergy ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Bless you , that all depends . If you have not the clergy 's sanction , then it is wicked and heathenish ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>But if they are invited , then it is Christianly and good ? Ha , ha ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Well , I did not say that . You had better apply to the consistory , they are better able to decide that point .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Ah , Pastor , you are a diplomat . Well , what are you two doing over there ? You are not saying a word .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>George is too lazy . He is drawing little men , and I am writing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>In his place I think I would prefer to draw little women . Eh , Pastor ?</p>

    <stage>Marie has entered with the bowl and glasses .</stage>

     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p><stage>Caressing her , with a shy glance at Marie .</stage>Why , yes , little one , thank you ! Look , how bright and beautiful the moon shines to-night ! Everything wrapped as in silvery spider web ! How beautiful !</p>

     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Oppressed .</stage>They will soon set off the bonfires .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>See , see — at last you have spoken ; I feared you had lost your tongue . Come here , my child . Get your glasses , all of you —— Your health ! The Pastor shall give us a toast ; yes , yes , Pastor !— a genuine pagan toast , well suited to this night ! Now , tell me , my child , are you obliged to go to the city again to-night ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Yes , papa dear .</p>

     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>But if I will not allow it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>You gave your permission quite two weeks ago , papa dear !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>But not to go in the middle of the night !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>I must go , papa . The men are to be there at seven in the morning , and if I am not there to give instructions the house will never be finished in time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Never mind , Henry , there is no help for it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>But look at her !</p>

     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Why , papa , there is nothing the matter with me . I am well and merry ——</p>

     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>You are merry , eh ? Let me hear you laugh !</p>

     <p><stage>Tries to laugh .</stage>Ha , ha , ha ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Imitating her .</stage>Yes , yes — ha , ha , ha ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Come here , my child .<stage>Strokes her hair .</stage>Did you sleep well last night ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Yes , mama .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>But if this stranger should attack you again ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Pardon me , but what do I hear ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Oh , nothing of importance , Pastor .<stage>To Marie .</stage>You will take the one o'clock train ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Yes , papa .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>There is another — at four — t'will be daylight then ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>But I would not reach the city in time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Very well , you need n't go to bed , then . George can take you to the depot .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Startled .</stage>George ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p><stage>Startled and simultaneously .</stage>What — I ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Certainly ! Why not ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Pray do not think me obtrusive ; but I am at your service .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>No , no , thank you . Pastor ; your time will come some other day .</l>
      <stage>Aside .</stage>
      <l>It will at least give him something to do .</l>
      <stage>Meaning George .</stage>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>I want to go too , papa ! I love moonshine promenades .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>No , no , my pet . In the first place , it is very improper for lovers to be out so late at night , without a chaperon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>I would much prefer to go alone . I am not at all afraid — and I do not wish to trouble George — or any one else ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Any one else is out of the question , for in this house every one rises at five in the morning .<stage>To George .</stage>Now , then , what excuse have you to offer ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Excuse ? I ? Why , none at all , except that she does not want me to go . You heard it yourself !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Have you two been quarreling again ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Do n't insist , Henry , if they do n't want to ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>By the way , send for Mr. Paul — I wish to speak to him . Pastor , your health !<stage>Drinks .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <stage>At this Marie and Gertrude go to door C ., and speak to some one outside in pantomime . A voice is heard .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Voice</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Paul ! Mr. Paul !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Paul</speaker>
     <p><stage>From behind scene .</stage>I am coming in one moment !<stage>Short pause . He enters .</stage>Here I am !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Ah , there you are ! Give him a glass of punch !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Paul</speaker>
     <p>Thank you , I have just had a glass of beer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Very well ! Now , do n't let us disturb you , children ! Pastor , this is the time to prepare your toast .<stage>Aside to Paul .</stage>Well , have you learned anything of this stranger ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Paul</speaker>
     <p>Not a sign of one , excepting two tramps at the inn , the gendarme placed under arrest ; but that was the day before yesterday .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>H 'm ! If I had ever had the slightest reason to doubt her word —— Marie , my child , come here to me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Yes , papa !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looks at her sharply .</stage>Never mind , now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Paul</speaker>
     <p><stage>Aside to Brauer .</stage>By the way , I saw the old woman again !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Sh ! not so loud ! Where ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Paul</speaker>
     <p>She had money , too ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>I wonder where she stole it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Paul</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I wonder ! The innkeeper said she had a gold piece . But do n't you worry ,</l>
      <l>Mr. Brauer . She will soon give us cause to have her locked up again .</l>
      <l>She is incorrigible !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Does she sleep at the inn ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Paul</speaker>
     <p>No , sir ! At night she leaves there , only to reappear in the morning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>H 'm ! that would almost be sufficient reason —— George !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Uncle ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>I have changed my mind . You must accompany Marie !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Just as you say , uncle !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>And no quarreling this time , Marie !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Yes , papa .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Yes , Mrs. Brauer !</p>

     <p>Oh , of course ; but do you love me more to-day ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>I love you always , my pet !</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Now , then , Pastor , we are ready for the toast ! Take up your glass , and fire away !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>I am afraid it will be hardly as wicked and heathenish as you seem to expect .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Come , come , Pastor , do n't keep us waiting !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Well , what shall I say ? I am not going to preach you a sermon !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>No , no , Pastor ; we are content to wait for that till Sunday .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Well , then , you see , on a beautiful and dreamy night like this — may I say dreamy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>You may , Pastor , you may !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>For we all dream at times , more or less , both young and old !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Ah , yes ! that is a failing we all have !! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>On such a dreamy night , different emotions are aroused within us . We seem to be able to look into the future , and imagine ourselves able to fathom all mystery and heal all wounds . The common becomes elevated , our wishes become fate ; and now we ask ourselves : What is it that causes all this within us — all these desires and wishes ? It is love , brotherly love , that has been planted in our souls , that fills our lives ; and , it is life itself . Am I not right ? And now , with one bound , I will come to the point . In the revelation you will find : “ God is love . ” Yes , God is love ; and that is the most beautiful trait of our religion — that the best , the most beautiful within us , has been granted us by Him above . Then how could I , this very evening , so overcome with feeling for my fellow-man — how could I pass Him by ? Therefore , Mr. Brauer , no matter , whether pastor or layman , I must confess my inability to grant your wish , and decline to give you a genuine pagan toast ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Grasps his hand .</stage>That was well spoken , Pastor ! Pardon me , I was only jesting !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>No , no , dear uncle , not altogether . There I must defend you against yourself . A devout and pious man like yourself , t'was not entire wantonness , your desire to hear something other than religious , and since the Pastor has so eloquently withdrawn , I will give you a toast . For , you see , my dear Pastor , something of the old pagan , a spark of heathenism , is still glowing somewhere within us all . It has outlived century after century , from the time of the old Teutons . Once every year that spark is fanned into flame — it flames up high , and then it is called “ The Fires of St. John . ” Once every year we have “ free night . ” Then the witches ride upon their brooms — the same brooms with which their witchcraft was once driven out of them — with scornful laughter the wild hordes sweep across the tree-tops , up , up , high upon the Blocksberg ! Then it is , when in our hearts awake those wild desires which our fates could not fulfill — and , understand me well , dared not fulfill — then , no matter what may be the name of the law that governs the world on that day , in order that that one single wish may become a reality , by whose grace we prolong our miserable existence , thousand others must miserably perish . Part because they were never attainable ; but the others , yes , the others , because we allowed them to escape us like wild birds , which , though already in our hands , but too listless to profit by opportunity , we failed to grasp at the right moment . But no matter . Once every year we have “ free night . ” And yonder tongues of fire shooting up towards the heavens — do you know what they are ? They are the spirits of our dead and perished wishes ! That is the red plumage of our birds of paradise we might have petted and nursed through our entire lives , but have escaped us ! That is the old chaos , the heathenism within us ; and though we be happy in sunshine and according to law , to-night is St. John 's night . To its ancient pagan fires I empty this glass . To-night they shall burn and flame up high — high — and again high ! Will no one drink to my toast ?</p>

      <l>My dear Mr. von Harten , above all your heathenism watches our good old</l>
      <l>God , our Father , and therefore I fearlessly drink to your toast .</l>

     <p>Did n't I tell you to take the proper precautions ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Paul</speaker>
     <p>I did . They had only three tar-barrels early this evening . Where they got the fourth from , I do n't know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>I 'll wager they found the barrel of axle-grease ! Why did n't you lock it up ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Paul</speaker>
     <p>You know yourself , on this day no lock or key is of any avail .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Do n't talk nonsense , but see what 's to be done . I will be there myself , presently . Be quick !<stage>Paul exits .</stage>I can n't depend on anybody these days ! Where is my hat ?<stage>Marie gets it .</stage></p>

     <p>Yes , gladly , but stop scolding . There is n't a breath of air stirring , and therefore no danger .</p>

     <p>Why , certainly , if it gives you pleasure !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Pleasure is hardly the proper word . I wanted to thank you for insisting upon my writing the bridal-poem . It has been a work of pleasure , I assure you . Do you like it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>It is very nice . Pastor !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Have you memorized it already ?</p>

     <p>I think so !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>No , Pastor !</p>

     <p>You are acting so strangely to-day ! You are so shy — so ——</p>

     <p>Would that it were over now !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps the thought of traveling alone at night has something to do with it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Oh !<stage>Recovering herself — lightly .</stage>You are right , Pastor ; but it can n't be helped !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Shall I come with you ? Oh , I 'll find something to be done in the city . I wo n't even have to ask permission . Anyway , I am longing for a glimpse of the good old town . I will inform the old pastor — I do n't think he has retired as yet ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Then please tell him —— I usually visit him myself every day , but now , just before the wedding , it 's impossible for me to call . Will you please tell him that ? I am so fond of him ! Tell him that , and in thought I kiss his hand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Certainly . And may I accompany you !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>No , thank you . Pastor !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Now let us speak openly , Miss Marie . I have been watching you all the evening . You appear to me — what shall I call it — like a mouse before a cat ! You need a protector ; some one in whom you can confide , some one ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>And so you would like to be my father confessor ! Eh , Pastor ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>You know very well we do not have that institution in the Protestant</l>
      <l>Church , though at times it might prove a blessing ——</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Mischievously .</stage>And then again it might not ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>You are quite right . We should all rely more upon ourselves ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>With emphasis .</stage>I do that , Pastor , I do !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Yes , my dear Marie — pardon me , I should not have said that — and yet I must speak frankly with you ; you seem to have a fear — a dread ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Of the cat ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>I wish I knew !! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>But supposing I were the cat , who would then be the mouse ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>That would be sinful and wicked in you !! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>But one cannot be the cat and the mouse at the same time ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Yes , one can ! But he who does , plays with his own destruction !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>And if one destroys one 's self , who cares ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>You should not talk like that , Miss Marie .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Oh , it is all nonsense , all nonsense , for to-night is St. John 's night . Do you see that fire yonder . Pastor ? They had to put it out ! But there , on the hill — look , there , there ! How beautiful ! How wild !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Yes , and when you look closely , it is nothing more than a mass of dirty lumber .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>For shame , Pastor !</p>
    </sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>You should not have said that , Pastor — you should not . I do n't want it ! I will not have you slander my St. John 's fires ! I want to enjoy it once — only once — then nevermore !! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p><stage>Disturbed .</stage>My dear Miss Marie , I do not understand the reason for your agitation , and I will not question you !

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Marie , I know I should not have spoken , at least not now . I should have waited — it was stupid of me , I know ; but I have such a fear — a fear for you . You are going to the city to-night and I do n't know what may happen ! But you shall know before you go , where you belong and that your future is assured !</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>Why , what is the matter ? Shall I get you a glass of water ? Or would you prefer wine ?</p>

     <p><stage>With an effort .</stage>Wine — wine — there — in the bowl !<stage>He helps her — she drinks .</stage>Thank you !<stage>Stirred .</stage>No one has ever waited on me before !</p>

     <p>Very well , Pastor ; but no one must know before the wedding !</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps on the wedding day — at the wedding feast ? Papa might make the announcement ; that would be such a fitting occasion !</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>No , no ! I will have to much to do then .</p>

     <p>What 's the matter —— Oh , my dear uncle , if I have failed to pay you the necessary respect , I beg your pardon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Respect ? Oh , damn you and your respect !</p>

     <p>Uncle ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>See here , perhaps I did wrong ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>You — wrong ? How ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Have you forgotten what passed between us yesterday ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>My dear uncle , that seems to me so far , far away !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>It strikes me you are going at a pretty fast gait !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>At any rate , uncle , do not worry about it . It will all come out right in the end .<stage>As he is listening towards the door , gives a sudden start .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>What 's the matter ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>I thought I heard some one ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Some one of the family perhaps , upstairs . Very well , then all is well , my boy ! Good-night , my son .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Good-night , uncle !<stage>Brauer exits , shaking his head .</stage></p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sits at table — tries to read — listens , goes to door C .— calls out softly into the garden .</stage>Who is there ?<stage>Still softer .</stage>Is that you , Marie ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p><stage>Whining outside .</stage>It 's only me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p><stage>Surprised .</stage>Gertrude , what do you want ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gertrude enters in nightgown and flowing hair .</stage>I am so uneasy , George dear ; I just wanted to look at you once more before going to sleep .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>But , little one , if papa should see you like this —— Quick , go back to your room .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>I cannot , my heart is so heavy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>How so , dear ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>George , I have been thinking ; I really am not good enough to be your wife .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Wha — what nonsense ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>I am too silly — oh , yes ; I never know what to say to you ! I am so stupid .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Why , my child — darling — pet ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>A while ago , out in the garden , and the moon shining so brightly , you walked by my side in deep silence ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Why , mama was with us ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>George , it is yet time . If you love some one else ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>In heaven 's name , child , have you ever mentioned this to any one ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Only to papa ; he was very angry and scolded me dreadfully .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>H 'm ! Now listen to me , my pet ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Rather than make you unhappy , I would jump into the river ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>In the first place , your presence here in this condition is decidedly improper ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>But we are to be married in three days ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>So much more reason .<stage>Stroking her hair .</stage>What beautiful hair you have , dear !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p><stage>Happily .</stage>Do you like it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>And in the second place , I will have none other than you . We will love each other very much . At first you will be my playmate — and then — later , perhaps — my real mate . Are you satisfied ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Yes , dear !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>And now , you must go to bed !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Then I will wrap myself in my hair — and I will dream of you and what you said — that it is beautiful — and so I will fall asleep . Good-night , George dear !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p><stage>Kisses her on the forehead .</stage>Good-night !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He gloomily takes position at table with a sigh when Gertrude exits , covering his face with his hands . Marie enters softly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Marie , you have come ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>It is early yet , is it not ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>We have a full hour more . Have they all gone to bed ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>I think so . All the lights are out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Come , sit here ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>I — I — I think I will go back upstairs !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>No , no ; here is something to read ! You see , I 'm reading myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Very well .<stage>Sits .</stage>But , George , I would really prefer to go to the depot alone .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p><stage>Softly .</stage>Marie !<stage>She shuts her eyes .</stage>Are you tired ?<stage>She shakes her head .</stage>One whole hour I will have you all to myself !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>George ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Marie !! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>The fires have all gone out , I suppose ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Ah , yes ; a small pyre of wood — it is soon burned down !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>And then it 's as dark as ever !!! But , George , how beautifully you spoke this evening ! I have never heard anything like it before .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>You were the only one who understood me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>No wonder ! It was as though I spoke the words myself — that is , I do n't mean to say ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>What , dear ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Oh , you know !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>But I do n't know !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>After a pause .</stage>George , I have something to confess to you . In fact , that is why I came down here so soon . You shall know it , you alone . I have this day given my hand ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a start .</stage>Marie !!! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Astonished .</stage>Well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>To whom ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Why , to the pastor ! Who else could it be ? There is no one else !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p><stage>Reproachfully .</stage>Why did you do that ? Why did you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>I have my whole life before me , and the fires<stage>pointing to fields and to heart</stage>will not burn forever ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p><stage>Bitterly .</stage>You should not have done it — you — it is a ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Sh — not so loud !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>But you do not love him at all !!! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>How do you know ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p><stage>Bitterly ,</stage>How ? Of course , how should I ? I do n't know ! Pardon me ! Well , I congratulate you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quietly .</stage>Thank you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>But why am I the first one to be taken into your confidence ? Why not uncle ? We two have not been so intimate as ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>No , we two have not been very intimate — I only thought ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>So , then , we have both our burden ; and we soon will have to part . Therefore we can now safely speak of the past . My manuscript you read ! You even went so far as to perjure yourself on account of it . Oh , you do n't mind a little thing like that ! I wish I were the same ! You know the subject of my verses , and we must now understand each other fully . Now , tell me openly , why , why did you treat me so unkindly , to say nothing worse , in former days ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Did I , George ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>‘ Tis hardly necessary to remind you of all the indignities you heaped upon me . It almost seemed to me as if you purposely intended to drive me mad . Do you remember the day when I followed you into the cellar , and you turned and ran out and locked the door , and compelled me to remain there all night ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>Yes , I remember !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Why did you do that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>That is very simple . You are Count von Harten — and I ?— I am but a poor Lithuanian foundling — aye , worse than that . If you follow such a one into the cellar , she knows , or at least thinks she knows , your purpose .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>So , that was the reason ! And at the same time you went under your manzanillo-tree to die ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Nods .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>And did you never realize the real state of things ? Gertrude was then still a child — and because I could not win you , I took her . Did that thought never occur to you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>How could I ever dare to think that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>But later ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>The day before yesterday , when I read your book , I felt it for the first time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>And now , it is too late ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Yes , now it is too late ! Had I felt then as I do now , I would not have resisted you ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Marie , do you know what you are saying ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Breaking out .</stage>Oh I do n't care , I do n't care ! It is my fate . You must rule and govern — and I — I must serve ; and in the end — we both must die ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Marie , you should be loved , you must be loved — beyond all senses — loved beyond all measure !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pointing towards R .</stage>He loves me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>He ?— Bah !! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Do n't be angry , George dear ; you do n't dare love me yourself . You can never be anything to me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>No , never ; for this house must be kept clean . No , no , this house must not be soiled . We would both suffocate in our shame . But we can think of what might have been ; that is not sin , is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>What were your words ? “ They are the wild birds of paradise , that have escaped us . ” That was it , was it not ? How beautiful !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>I do n't remember !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>But I am not a wild bird , George ; I am tame — so tame ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>You are tame ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>For you , George dear , only for you !! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Marie , my love !<stage>Strokes her hair affectionally , then moves away .</stage>No , no , we must be strong ! Only a few minutes ago , Gertrude came softly down those stairs ; if she should come again — my God ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>What did she want ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>You can imagine ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>The poor thing ! But you will love her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>As well as possible ! But then I must not think of you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>But you must not think of me — and I will try and not think of you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Never , Marie ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Only occasionally — on holidays ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Only then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>And on St. John 's eve ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>When the fires are burning ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Yes , and when the fires are out , then I shall cry ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Marie !!! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>No , no , George , sit still — I will sit here . Some one might be in the garden , after all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>They are all sound asleep !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Even so ! We must be brave ; not for mine — but for your sake , George .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Why did you say that ? What do you think of me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>I think you are hard-hearted .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>And yet you love me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I love you , for your own sake . For you have had to struggle and fight — and that is what made you what you are . I have also fought and struggled ; but I have lost faith in myself — lost faith in everything . If you only knew !! Sometimes I am afraid of myself — sometimes I would commit murder , so restless and without peace I am .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>With me you would have found peace . We would have worked together and planned through half the nights — and you know how ambitious I am .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>And so am I , for you ! You should be the first and greatest . They all shall bow before you — I myself will kneel before you and say to you : “ You love to rule and command ? Now rule — now command !!!!!! ”</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Throws herself before him — her arms around his knees , looking up .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Marie , in heaven 's name rise ! If any one should see you so ——</p>
    </sp>

     <p><stage>Rising .</stage>You are right . It was low in me . But he who originates where I do , is low — so low ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Do n't think of it , Marie ! Think of this house and all the love it has given you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>How quiet everything is — not a sound to be heard — as silent as the grave ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Then be content , for they have buried us together !</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>If they only had ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>And see the pale moon — how it throws its silvery rays over the garden — and yonder is your manzanillo-tree .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes , do you see it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>And its white , trembling leaves ; see , see , each one seems alive — though not a breath of air is stirring . Come , let us go to it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>There — something moved . It must be Gertrude .<stage>Goes to door C. and calls .</stage>“ Gertrude !!! ”</p>

     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Why for us ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>It is the old pastor 's desire ; half an hour this morning , and then again this afternoon , when we exchange rings . Do you know , George , mama says a bride 's dream the night before her wedding is surely an omen . Do you believe that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p><stage>Preoccupied .</stage>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>I dreamed last night of a large , yellow wheat-field , in which a poor little rabbit had hidden itself ; and high above , in the air , I saw a large hawk . Then it appeared to me that I was the little rabbit , and in fear and dread I called out “ George ! George ! ” when suddenly it shot down upon me !— just think ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>And then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Then I awoke . The cold perspiration stood thickly upon my brow —— Oh , George dear , you will protect me ? You wo n't let any one hurt me , will you ? For I am only a poor little rabbit , after all ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>George , I wanted to ask you something .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>You do n't love some one else , do you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p><stage>Disturbed .</stage>But , my child ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Well , you know that if a bride cannot laugh on her wedding day , she loves another ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Why , nonsense ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p><stage>Unshaken .</stage>Oh , yes , George ; I read it myself . And even if you do , George , I feel so — my love for you is so great , it could move mountains . I love you so dearly —— She will surely learn to forget you , I will love you so much .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>But , my pet ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>No , no , George . You see , I do n't blame you so much . How could I ? For what am I , compared to other women ?— George , does she love you so very much ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Who ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Oh , you know . But do n't worry , George dear ; she will forget you in time ! Do n't you remember Robert , our neighbor 's son ? He threatened to kill himself if I did n't marry him , and he has already forgotten me ! And to-day , when we stand at the altar , at the Doxology and the exchange of rings , I will nudge you softly , and then we will both pray to our good Father in heaven to make it easy for her ; for no one shall be unhappy on this day ! Why , George , you are crying !!! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Crying — I ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Why , yes ! Here are two large tears running down your cheek .<stage>Wipes his eyes with her handkerchief .</stage>So there ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Tell me , my pet ; and if we should be parted , after all ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>How could that be possible ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>If I should die — or ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p><stage>Embracing him .</stage>No , no ! Do n't say that ! Do n't say that !! !</p>

     <p>Why this tone ? Does it perhaps mean that between us all is over ?</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>No , no . You would criticise and find fault , and embarrass Marie , and me , too . Now be good , George , and go into the garden .<stage>George exits .</stage></p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>But Marie , we had decided upon that ! Have you forgotten ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Oh , pardon me — I — of course we had !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Then give me a kiss !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Marie suddenly takes her head in both hands and stares at her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p><stage>Frightened .</stage>Why do you look at me so strangely ?</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>I ? How so ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Has begun to comb .</stage>How can you ask ? You are about to be married — and — and — I — I am jealous of you !</p>

    <stage>Marie , with one braid in her hand , bending back , laughing loudly and forced .</stage>

     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p><stage>In pain .</stage>Oh , you are pulling my hair ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>Any one as happy as you should be able to bear a little pain . There ! I will braid it into your hair — for you are happy , are you not ? Very happy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>

     <p><stage>Lurkingly .</stage>Perhaps you were right ! Perhaps he does love another !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p><stage>Softly groaning .</stage>Oh , why did you say that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Because —— No , no — how could he ? That was wicked in me , was n't it ? How could he think of another , when he looks at you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>No , no , Marie , you are right ! I told him so myself !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Slowly and marked .</stage>And what did he say ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>He ?— He said nothing ! And then — he cried ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Triumphantly .</stage>He cried ? George cried ? Have you ever seen him do that before ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>No , never !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>To herself .</stage>He cried ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>And then he said : “ What if we should be parted , after all ? ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>If who should be parted — you and he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Yes — if he should die ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>If he — oh , that is what he meant ! Oh , well , he just wanted to say something .<stage>With forced lightness .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Of course he did . But what about the other woman ? Oh , I did n't let him see that I cared — and for the time I did n't care , really ; but now , when I think of it ! My God !— if it were really so ! If I only knew !!!!!! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Of course , he would not tell you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Do you think he would tell any one else ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sooner than tell you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Yes ! I suppose so !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Shall I ask him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>Oh , if you would do that for me ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>There now , it is done . Here is the comb and the rest of the hairpins . Now go !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>I am sure he will .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>

     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Not even on account of our betrothal ?</p>

     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>We will have no betrothal , Pastor !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>What are you saying ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>I shall leave this place ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>You ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>To-day , I leave this house !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Pardon me , if I have forced my attentions upon you ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>No ! You have not !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>My attentions were honorable , I assure you ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Thank you , Pastor , I know that ; but ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Then it is not on my account you are leaving ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Certainly not !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Does any one here know of your intention ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>No one !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Miss Marie , I am still a young man ; if I should mention such a word as “ life 's happiness , ” it would , perhaps , sound absurd . Therefore , I will not speak of myself . My fate is in my own hands . But if you realize this moment what you owe to this house — and I say this not for mine , nor for their sake , I say it for yours and yours alone ; though I am but a poor mortal — it pains me — but be that as it may — Marie , if you cause a discord in this house , the blame will rest upon yourself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Pardon me — I will not question you . I wish to know nothing ; that , in the end , is always the best . Did I not love you as well as myself , I would not speak another word ; but as matters stand now , I will say one — aye , one more word — I would not have dared to say otherwise . The greatest , the highest thing one possesses in this world , is his life 's melody — a certain strain that ever vibrates , that his soul forever sings — waking or dreaming , loudly or softly , internally or externally . Others may say : “ His temperament or his character is so , or so . ” He only smiles , for he knows his melody and he knows it alone . You see , Miss Marie , my life 's happiness you have destroyed , but my life 's melody you can not take from me . That is pure and will always remain so . And now I say to you , Miss Marie , if you fill this house , where you have obtained everything you possess — honor , bread , and love — if you fill this house with sorrow — if you dare to sin against your father and your mother ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>One moment , Pastor . My father and my mother — what do you know about them ? My father I do n't know myself , but my mother ? Ah yes , I know her well ; and from her I have inherited my life 's melody . This melody has a beautiful text . Do you want to know what it is , Pastor ? It is , “ Thou shalt steal . Steal everything for thyself — thy life 's happiness — thy love — all — all . Only others will enjoy it in the end . ” Yes , Pastor , my mother is a thief . On St. John 's eve she came stealthily over yonder garden hedge ; and as my mother , so am I ! And now , Pastor , ask me no more ; I need all my senses , for to-day my entire happiness is at stake ! There — now you know all !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pastor</speaker>
     <p>Yes , now I know ! Farewell , Miss Marie . I will forget this day , perhaps ; you — never ——</p>

     <p>And will you come and tell me at once ?</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Have you arranged it so ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>You wished to speak to me , so I have arranged it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Marie , I wished to tell you . One hour more I am a free man — and my mind is made up . It is yet time to change our fates . What will you answer me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Answer you ? Why , I do n't know what you want .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>You know it well enough . I want you ! Do you hear me ? You , who belong to me for life — I want you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Softly — happily .</stage>I thought the fires were out — and you had forgotten me — and now you want me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p><stage>Softly .</stage>Are you not mine ? Are you not my wife in the eyes of heaven ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Yes , but in the eyes of the world it is Gertrude !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Must it , then , be so ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Doubtingly .</stage>Go — go — you love her ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I do love her . How could I help that ? Do you not also love her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Bitterly .</stage>Ah , I do n't know . A few moments ago , when I saw her in your arms — and you wept , too — only , because you love her !! Oh , but I can bear it !! I will bear it like — like — ah !—— But there — that is no one 's affair but mine ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>So , so , that is no one 's affair but yours , eh ? You might have invented a sweeter torture . I meant to remain an honorable man all my life ; if unable — well , there are plenty of bullets left .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>And do you wish to die ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>I do not want to , I must !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>George , then take me with you ?<stage>He shakes his head .</stage>For years I have carried the wish in my heart — to kill you ! Then I would kiss and love you like mad — and then follow you into eternity ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Nonsense , girl , nonsense ! Ca n't you see , how one turns round and round and round in a circle , till at last to find no other escape than death ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>I am not afraid to die ; though with you , I 'd rather live ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>To live , dear , will require more courage for both of us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>How so ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Can you ask ? Here in this house , to which we owe everything — both you and I ? Where they gave us food , shelter and love ? After all that , would you have the courage to destroy their happiness ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>The good old pastor used to say : “ You must have the courage to do everything , except to do wrong . ” I would even have the courage to do wrong .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Shall I put you to the test ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>If you will give me your hand now and say to me : “ Come , we will run away , through yonder garden gate — just as we are — now , this very moment ” — you shall see how I will run !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>What ?— Secretly — without telling any one ? Is that what you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Do n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laughs bitterly .</stage>No , no !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Well , what then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Face to face , like a man . There he stands — I here . If he will give me back my word , ‘ tis well . If he refuses<stage>determined</stage>, ‘ tis also well .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>My God ! You know his temper ! He will kill us — he will kill us both !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>‘ Tis death either way ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>George — think ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I have thought of it for two days and two nights . One is madness and the other insanity . There is no other way .<stage>Pained .</stage>Only the thought of the child gives me pain ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Of course , if your feelings for Gertrude ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Then it is your desire ?<stage>She nods assent .</stage>Very well ! So be it ! But remember , it is a question of life and death !— And , therefore , you yourself must be present .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>In terror .</stage>I ?— I be present when you ask him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>What ?— You , who wish to become my helpmate and partner in life , and share all my life 's troubles — you would desert me now — desert me in this hour ?— and I very much fear , not the worst in store for us ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>No , no , George ; it 's not that — not that ! But you know how we have feared him and have trembled for years — and now I should ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>If you can n't even do that ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>If necessary — yes I — I will do it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Then — as soon as he returns .<stage>Brauer is heard breathing heavily .</stage>Ah , here he is !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Enters .</stage>Why , that is almost an old-time Biblical miracle . Just think , children , think of it —— But where is Gertrude ? Well ? Ca n't you speak ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Trembling .</stage>I think she is dressing !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Well , it will interest you also , so listen : I met the assistant pastor as he came from the house here , and he told me , rather piqued , that our good old pastor had suddenly risen from his bed and limpingly insisted upon delivering the wedding discourse himself . Well — what 's the matter ? Are n't you glad ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>H 'm ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Of course , you are a perfect heathen ! But I say , our assistant pastor must have been terribly put out . He had been preparing for that same address for days . He looked rather crestfallen ; but then , there is no help for it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Pardon me , uncle ; in order to save time , I must ask you for an interview .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>What , again ? Ca n't you wait till afternoon ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>No ! Before the ceremony , if you please .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Startled .</stage>Wha — oh , I see . I suppose now you will demand more than I am willing to give ? Marie , leave us<stage>Paul enters .</stage>Well , what now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Paul</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gives him a sign .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>There , look at him ! Well , have you lost your tongue , man ? Why do n't you speak ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Paul</speaker>
     <p>No , no , Mr. Brauer , I have something to say to you — alone .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Then why do n't you come nearer ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Paul</speaker>
     <p><stage>Whispering .</stage>We have just now caught the old woman .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>With a glance at Marie .</stage>
      <l>What ? Marie , you may remain and chat with</l>
      <l>George for awhile ; he is a very interesting young man .</l>
      <stage>Softly , to Paul .</stage>
      <l>Where ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Paul</speaker>
     <p>Down in the cellar ; just as I wanted to put the beer on the ice , I found her there in a dark corner , loaded down with plunder !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Is she there now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Paul</speaker>
     <p>Yes , struggling like a demon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Undoubtedly this offense will earn her a good long term in prison and we will be rid of her for a long time ! But how to get her out of the house ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Paul</speaker>
     <p>Leave that to me Mr. Brauer ; I know a way to keep her quiet .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes , and in the meantime I will make out the papers and we will hand her over to the Gendarme ; that will be the best . Children , I will be busy for a moment ! Wait here until I return .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Do n't forget , uncle !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>No , no . I 'll be back in a moment . Come , Mr. Paul !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Both exit .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>You are trembling ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Am I ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Marie dear , I am with you . No one shall harm you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Oh , it is not that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>What , then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I do n't know . It has suddenly come over me so ——<stage>Starts .</stage>Sh ! He 's coming !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Noise . Scuffling of feet and smothered cries are heard .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>What is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>In God 's name , be still !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gypsy</speaker>
     <p><stage>Calling for help .</stage>Mine daughter ! Mine Mamie ! My Mamie ! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Hear ? Hear ? My mother ! They are taking her away — to prison ! Sh ! Be still ! No , no ; do n't open the door ! Be quiet ! Be quiet !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gypsy</speaker>
     <p><stage>Not as loud as before .</stage>Oh , mine daughter ! My Mamie — my Mamie ——!<stage>Dying out .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Will you not go out to her , no matter what she has done ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>How can I ? How can I ? I am afraid — afraid ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Then shall I go ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Frightened .</stage>No , no ; do n't leave me !! Sh ! Be quiet ! So , quiet ! Now they have gone ! Thank heaven !<stage>Again wailing , but very distant .</stage>Hear ? Hear ? Let her shriek ! Let her call ! I cannot help her ! I am a thief , the same as she . I , too , have come to this house , and I have stolen . But oh , my God , what have I stolen ? What have I stolen ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Come , Marie , control yourself ! Think of what we have before us !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes — I 'll be quiet ! What have we before us ? No , no ; I will not — I cannot — I ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Do you mean to ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>In door .</stage>Did you hear anything , children ? Any noise ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>We heard screams and a scuffle . What was the matter ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Oh , nothing of any consequence . Do n't mind it . An old vagabond of a woman , that 's all . I have only to sign the papers now , then I 'll be back .<stage>Exit .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Marie !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Hush , not a word , not a word ! She out there must go her way , and I must go mine !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>What do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>You said it yourself . ‘ Tis madness ! Yes , yes ; ‘ tis madness ! All — all ! What we do — what we desire — all — all !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Marie !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Or do you imagine for one moment we could be happy together ? No , I know you too well . I know the certain result . You would never forgive yourself nor me , and in the end life would become a burden to me , if only because I was in your way . Yes , yes , that would be the end of it all ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Marie , I will be faithful to you forever , let come what may , be it good or bad ; you know that !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Yes , thank God !— yes !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>If there was only the slightest possibility of a chance to escape from all this whirl — then we might be free , we might —— But no matter what we begin , we cannot shake off nor disregard our obligations to this house ; never , as long as we live !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Therefore , what more can you desire ? Everything on earth we possess , all that was beautiful , all the love , all — all , we gave to each other . There is nothing more to give , for either one of us . St. John 's night is past , the fires are out , are dead ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>And what shall become of us ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Of you ? That I can n't tell . Perhaps you will be happy , perhaps not ; that must all rest with yourself . And I ? Oh , be content . I will take care of myself . As soon as possible I shall leave this house . Not to-day , as I would like — it might create suspicion ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>And where will you go ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Ah , the world is large . I shall go far , far away , where no one will ever find me . No , no , not even you , George .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>And if you should go to ruin out there ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>Do not fear . I am the calamity child , the foundling . My hands are hard and callous — see , see ! Just like my heart is , now . I will work and work , and toil , until I fall exhausted — then I will sleep and rest , until it is time for work again ; and thus I will perhaps maintain a miserable existence .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>You say you are a calamity child ! Well , so am I . But our accounts do not harmonize . You are going out into the world and misery , and it was I who drove you to it . Even did I not love you as I do , that thought would follow me forever and embitter my entire life . But , be it so . We are both children of misery ! Therefore let us grit our teeth , shake each other by the hand — and say farewell !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Softly .</stage>Good-bye , Georgie dear — and — do n't be afraid — he is not yet coming — and forgive me — do you hear ? From to-day — you understand ? Did I not love you as much as I do , this would not have been quite so hard ; but there — there — ‘ tis all right now — I know ; I can never be entirely poor now ; for once , at least , the fires of St. John have burned for me — once — just once ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p>Marie ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Glancing around .</stage>Do n't — do n't ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Enters , followed by Gertrude .</stage>Has n't the carriage arrived yet , children ? And where is papa ? It is time to go .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>He is coming now , I believe .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p><stage>Enters .</stage>So there , I am ready to go ! But , that is , you wanted to speak to me first ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>George</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a glance at Marie .</stage>It is all settled now , thank you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Then come , wife , my coat , quick !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She helps him with frocks after he has divested himself of jacket .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p><stage>Aside to Marie .</stage>Did you ask him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Nods .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p>And what did he say ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Marie</speaker>
     <p>It was all nonsense , my pet . He loves you and only you . He never has loved any one else — he says — and he will be very happy — so he says ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gertrude</speaker>
     <p><stage>Embraces him joyfully .</stage>My darling George ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brauer</speaker>
     <p>Come , come , my child — time enough for that after the ceremony . Come !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>All follow him to the door . When George reaches door he turns , and as he takes one parting glance at Marie , Brauer pushes him off . Marie stands motionless , looking after them , handkerchief in mouth , nervously forcing it between her teeth .</stage>
    <stage>Curtain .</stage>
