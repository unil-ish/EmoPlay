For reasons that need not be given , it has been thought best to postpone The Slavs , which will present man 's battle for political liberty , and offer The Americans , the theme of which is the industrial conflict that is now raging . The Hindoos , a drama of spiritual unfoldment , will come in its order .</titlePart></docTitle>

    <p>Scene : On the mountains in a timber region of north-western America . In every direction , as far as the eye can see , a wilderness of stumps with piles of brush black with age and sinking from sheer rottenness into the ground . Here and there a dead pine stands up high against the horizon . In the distance , left , cleaving the range and extending on back under an horizon of cold gray clouds , is seen the line of a river of which this whole region is apparently the watershed , for everywhere the land slopes toward it . In the remote distance , beyond the river , innumerable bare buttes , and beyond these a gray stretch of plains . Down the mountains , left , six or seven miles away , the river loops in and a portion of a town is seen upon its banks . At this end of the town , upon a hill overlooking the river , a large white mansion conspicuous for the timber about it . At the farther end , a huge red saw-mill occupies the centre of a vast field of yellow lumber piles , the tall black stack of the mill clearly outlined against the gray of the land beyond . Back , a hundred yards or so , a road , evidently constructed years ago when the logs were being taken out , comes up on the flats from the direction of the town , turns sharply to the right and goes toward the ridge . Beyond this road , just at the curve , standing out among the stumps , an old stationary engine eaten up with rust and an abandoned logging-wagon , the hind part resting upon the ground , the two heavy wheels lying upon it . Farther back a small cabin falling into decay . Here and there patches of creeping vines and rank grass cover the ground , hiding in some places to a considerable depth the bases of the stumps . But to the left , where it is evident a steep slope plunges down , and also in the foreground , are open spaces with boulders and , scattered about under a thin loam of rotted needles and black cones , the outlines of a few flat stones . In the immediate foreground , left , a huge boulder , weighing possibly four or five tons , barely hangs upon the slope , ready at any moment , one would think , to slip and plunge down . Two men , Cap Saunders and Harvey Anderson , the latter down left , the former to the right and farther back , are slowly coming forward . Each has a camping outfit , a roll of blankets , etc ., upon his back , and carries in his hands a plaster cast of what would seem to be a cross-section of a log . It is about two feet in diameter and three inches thick . As they come along they try the casts on the various stumps and carefully turn them about to see if they fit , then chip the stump with a hatchet to indicate that it has been tried .</p>
   </set>
  </front>
  <body>
   <stage>Time : The evening of a day early in November in the present time .</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>And say two dollars profit on each log .</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>That 's low enough .</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>Suppose a man could walk Over the mountains with a great big sack And pick two silver dollars from each stump . It 's forty miles to where the trees begin , And on each side the river eight or ten . Think what he 'd have .</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>He 's made work for them , Harvey .</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>Have millions , would n't he ?</stage>
   <stage>Cap Saunders .</stage>
   <stage>I suppose he would . But where would this land be ? There 'd be no homes . And what are forests for but to cut down ?</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>You would n't hear him say , ‘ Now , Harvey , you Go in and get your sack full ; I 'll stay out ’ ; Or ‘ Now it 's your turn , Cap . ’ Not on your life . He 'd walk his legs off , but he 'd have them all . Or what 's more likely , he 'd let others walk , And send his wagons out and get the sacks And have them brought in to him .</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>For myself I 'd rather be out here though on the mountains Than live in his big mansion .</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>So would I . But that do n't mean I 'd rather tramp the flats Picking up dollars for some other man . And I suppose the mill-boys feel the same .</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>A fellow has to do the best he can . If he can stake himself , then off , I say , And pan for his own self . That 's been my way . Sometimes I 've struck pay dirt and sometimes not . And then I 'd go and dig for a month or two For the other boys until I 'd got my stake ——</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>Here is another like the one back there ; Goes half way round as clean as anything ; And the bark seems the same ; but on this side ——</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>( Who has left his cast and is hurrying forward excitedly )</stage>
   <stage>Hold her a minute !</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>No , it do n't fit , Cap . The same old finger width it 's always been . When the curve matches , then there 's some damn knot ; And when the knot 's not there , it 's something else . No , you can n't stretch it . Now it 's this side ; see ? ‘ Twas best the way I had it . There you are . Might as well mark her .</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>It 's a close miss , sure . It 's like the one I found upon the ridge Week before last .</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>The place where it do n't match Is always on the side that you do n't see Until your heart 's jumped up .</stage>
   <stage>( Chips the stump )</stage>
   <stage>That ends the day .</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>I think I 'll work a while .</stage>
   <stage>( Starts back )</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>The sun 's gone down .</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>I have n't heard the whistle of the mill .</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>Nor like to .</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>Ah ! I keep forgetting that . When a man 's heard her blow for years and years He can n't be always thinking that she 's stopped . I wonder how the strike is getting on .</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>As everything gets on that 's Egerton 's . He 'll cut them down as he 's cut down the trees .</stage>
   <stage>( Sits upon a stump and looks off up the valley , then turns and watches the old man busy with his cast )</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>Your old bones must be tired , Cap .</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>How so ?</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>How long have you been hunting for this thing ?</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>Before this search , you mean ?</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>Yes .</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>Off and on , Thirty or forty years .</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>And wo n't give up ?</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>Not till I 'm dead .</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>You ought to have been an ox . You 've got the wrong form , Cap . You think you 'd be As patient if the prize was for yourself ?</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>When one 's been on a trail for years and years It ai n't the game he cares for ; it 's the chase . And like as not when he 's brought down the buck He 'll leave the carcass lying on the rocks , Taking a piece or two , then off again . As for what 's done with it , I do n't care that . But I would like to know where that tree stood .</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>And you think the boys down there should be the same , The boys that saw the dollars from the logs , Sacking the silver up , be satisfied To have him take the silver , leaving them The bark on either side ?</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>I do n't say that .</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>Give me the carcass when you find it , Cap , And you can have the chase . I 'd like to know For one time in my life just how it feels To have your pockets full and taste the towns . And I think the boys that saw the logs down there Are more like me , Cap , than they are like you .</stage>
   <stage>( Picks up his cast and comes forward )</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>Egerton ai n't a-holdin ’ them . They can go If they ai n't satisfied .</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>Yes , they can go . They 're like the red men , they can always go .</stage>
   <stage>( In an open space in the foreground he puts his things down upon the ground . He goes right to a pile of brush , pulls out a black limb , and proceeds to break it across his knee , throwing the pieces in a little heap upon the ground )</stage>
   <stage>They 've got a Mayor down there , I suppose . What if he said , ‘ If you do n't like my way , If you ai n't satisfied , there 's the road off there ? ’ Or say the lad we 've got in Washington — What if he said , ‘ If you do n't like my way , There 's ships there in the harbor ? ’ Think we 'd leave ? You 've had your eyes , Cap , on the ground so long That you 've forgotten there 's such things as men .</stage>
   <stage>( The old man comes down to the stump which he and Anderson tried earlier in the scene . Anderson picks up his kindling and goes left and proceeds to start a fire . The night gathers quickly )</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>( Trying the stump )</stage>
   <stage>Be careful , Harvey , or they 'll see the flame And think it 's found already .</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>I do n't care . ‘ Twould serve them right .</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>They 're watching at this hour .</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>‘ Now we 've got millions ! ’ then say ‘ April Fool . ’ God , I do n't blame them though ; I 'd do it too .</stage>
   <stage>( Picks up a blanket and , sticking pieces of brush in the ground , hangs it between the fire and the town )</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>Aug. Jergens he 'd be mighty mad , I tell you .</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>If I could put men out , you bet I would . And when I found the gold I 'd make her fly . You would n't catch me quarrelling with a lot Of fellows for the bones , I tell you that . I 'd take a rump or two , then say , ‘ Light in And fill your bellies ’ ; or , ‘ Come on ; I 'm rich ; Let 's take a turn together . ’ And I 'd buy A train or two and we 'd all take a spin Around the world . I 'd make their hair stand up . I 'd show those eastern fellows once or twice .</stage>
   <stage>( Goes left and climbs up on the boulder and looks back over the waste )</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>( Coming forward )</stage>
   <stage>You 'll have that rolling down if you do n't mind .</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>And that 's one reason I 'll be always broke , For I know how to spend , while Egerton And Jergens and those fellows down there do n't , In spite of their big houses . They know how To quarrel with men and squeeze their last dime out , But they do n't know how to say , ‘ By God , come on ; Let 's have a drink together ; we 're all friends . ’</stage>
   <stage>( The old man busies himself about the fire , preparing the evening meal . Anderson sits down on the boulder and looks off up the valley . Where the town was seen , lights begin to appear )</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>You 'll wake up some day , Cap , and look about And Harvey will be gone .</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>You do n't mean that ! You ai n't took no offence at what I said ?</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>Mad as the Devil , Cap .</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>Do n't you know , Harvey , About the rolling stone ?</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>There 's some stones , Cap , Would rather have the motion than the moss .</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>You 're sure a wild one , Harvey ; that you are . You 'd stir a muss up , that 's what you would do .</stage>
   <stage>( Goes to the boulder and stands beside Anderson , and they both look off up the valley )</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>The mansion all lit up — what 's going on ?</stage>
   <stage>( They are silent )</stage>
   <stage>It 's a strange world , Cap , it 's a funny world . You throw a piece of bread down ; it draws ants , Red ants and black ants , little ants and big , And if you 'll keep it up you 'll have them here Building their hills about you ; you know that .</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>( Returning to the fire )</stage>
   <stage>It 's wonderful how much some men can do .</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>Well , men are ants , and Egerton he 's had bread . And he 's kept throwing it down there in the valley , First crumb by crumb and later chunk by chunk , Until he 's drawn them round him , thousands of them , And when they 've come he 's put them all to work . And to see them at it ! I could spend my life Sitting upon the mountains on some rock That hangs above the town , watching them drudge . ‘ Get me my logs out ; ’ and they get his logs . ‘ Now saw them ; make me lumber ; ’ and they do it , ‘ Build me my railroad ; ’ and they blast the rocks . ‘ Now up with my big mansion on the hill , And carve me all my ants upon the walls , Some sawing logs , others with axes raised Hard at the big round boles , some half cut down ; Make her look like a forest through and through . ’ And they 've tugged at it till they 've got it done . And all they 've chopped and sawed and built is his , And he puts it in his pocket and sits down And they can n't help themselves . They 've got to eat , And Egerton he 's the man that 's ——</stage>
   <stage>( He has risen and stands looking back through the darkness )</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>What do you say , Harvey , let 's spend the night back in the cabin . It ai n't the cold I mind , but from the air I would n't be surprised if it would snow .</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>By God , Cap !</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>Eh ?</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>Looks like the boys had found it .</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>You do n't , do n't say !</stage>
   <stage>( Goes to the boulder )</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>Off there , beyond the knob .</stage>
   <stage>( Bill Patten comes through the darkness , rear right . He looks about , then spies the men )</stage>
   <p>BILL PATTEN .</p>
   <stage>You got some grub that you can spare , boys ?</stage>
   <stage>( Goes near the men and gets their line of vision )</stage>
   <stage>That ? It 's the moon rising .</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>Ah , I 'm glad , I 'm glad !</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>Against the sky it looked like some far fire .</stage>
   <stage>( Gets down from the boulder )</stage>
   <p>BILL PATTEN .</p>
   <stage>You 're of the force that 's huntin ’ for the mine ?</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>That 's ‘ hunting ’ for it , yes .</stage>
   <p>BILL PATTEN .</p>
   <stage>You 'll find it .</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>Why ?</stage>
   <p>BILL PATTEN .</p>
   <stage>Egerton 's luck .</stage>
   <stage>( Calls back )</stage>
   <stage>O Silas !</stage>
   <stage>( To Anderson )</stage>
   <stage>‘ Tai n't no use A-fightin ’ that old wolf or ‘ spectin ’ God To put his hand between J. D. and gold . He 's got a devil that takes care of him .</stage>
   <stage>( Silas Maury and his son Willie , a boy of twelve or thirteen , enter rear )</stage>
   <p>BILL PATTEN .</p>
   <stage>And the same devil blacks Aug. Jergens ’ boots . I 'd like to get that man in some lone spot .</stage>
   <stage>( They sit down . The workmen seize food and eat ravenously )</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>

   <stage>How 's the strike ?</stage>
   <p>BILL PATTEN .</p>
   <stage>I ai n't a man To show the white while there 's a chance to win .</stage>
   <p>SILAS MAURY .</p>
   <stage>They 've got till sun-down to report for work .</stage>
   <p>BILL PATTEN .</p>
   <stage>They 'll feel like dogs , too , goin ’ in that gate , After the bluff they 've made , lickin ’ his hand . Me for some other town . I 'd rather starve .</stage>
   <p>SILAS MAURY .</p>
   <stage>They 're ‘ ranging to bring in a lot of scabs To-morrow , when the Governor will be there .</stage>
   <p>BILL PATTEN .</p>
   <stage>Much as to say , ‘ Now knock ‘ em ! ’ Son of a bitch !</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>The Governor ?</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>What 's the trouble ?</stage>
   <p>BILL PATTEN .</p>
   <stage>Cakes and pies .</stage>
   <p>SILAS MAURY .</p>
   <stage>It 's Egerton 's big reception .</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>( To Cap Saunders )</stage>
   <stage>Explains the lights . They 're getting things in shape .</stage>
   <p>SILAS MAURY .</p>
   <stage>Yes .</stage>
   <stage>( He and Anderson walk a little way left and look back toward the mansion )</stage>
   <p>BILL PATTEN .</p>
   <stage>When the boys First talked of strikin ’ when they made the cut I said , ‘ Do n't do it . Egerton 's a man — You 'd better fight the Devil than fight him . He 'll show no mercy on you if you cross him . ’ I guess they know by now that Bill was right . Sam Williams though he thinks he knows . ‘ Hang on . ’ All right , hang on ; but you will see what comes . It 's hell . I 'd rather die out on some rock .</stage>
   <p>SILAS MAURY .</p>
   <stage>There ai n't no room for poor men in this world . I do n't know what God ever made us for .</stage>
   <stage>( He and Anderson return to the fire )</stage>
   <p>BILL PATTEN .</p>
   <stage>The man that 's got no home 's a lucky man .</stage>
   <p>SILAS MAURY .</p>
   <stage>I said to Willie , ‘ I 'm glad mother 's dead . ’</stage>
   <stage>( A pause )</stage>
   <p>WILLIE MAURY .</p>
   <stage>Think she can see us , pa ?</stage>
   <p>SILAS MAURY .</p>
   <stage>I do n't think so .</stage>
   <p>BILL PATTEN .</p>
   <stage>She 's better off .</stage>
   <p>SILAS MAURY .</p>
   <stage>That 's true . I hope she can n't . She died a-thinkin ’ Willie would be rich Some day , if they ever found the mine .</stage>
   <p>BILL PATTEN .</p>
   <stage>( Bitterly )</stage>
   <stage>Give ‘ em your apples and expect the core .</stage>
   <p>SILAS MAURY .</p>
   <stage>It came so quick , though , Bill ; he did n't think .</stage>
   <p>BILL PATTEN .</p>
   <stage>If he had just kept still and called to Chris And had him help and roll the log aside And then at night let some of us men know , We could have slipped it out and hidden it , And gone to Egerton and said , ‘ See here , We 've found the log that you 've been lookin ’ for These years and have n't found it —— ’</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>You do n't mean ——</stage>
   <p>BILL PATTEN .</p>
   <stage>‘ And if you 'll do the square thing we 'll cough up ; If not , we 'll go and find the mine ourselves . ’</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>You do n't mean ‘ twas the boy that found the log !</stage>
   <p>SILAS MAURY .</p>
   <stage>Willie here found it .</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>Well , well , well ! H-u-rrah ! Hurrah , I say !</stage>
   <stage>( Throws his hat into the air . Harry Egerton comes through the darkness rear right )</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>If I could call the men , Call up the men , my son , who 've spent their lives Tryin ’ to get a peep of that there trunk — You hear that , boys , you up there in the air ?</stage>
   <p>BILL PATTEN .</p>
   <stage>He 'd come to terms , all right , you bet your life .</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>Good evening , men . I 'm turned around a bit , Or seem to be . Just where is Foreston ?</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>You see those lights down there ?</stage>
   <stage>( He walks back , left . Harry Egerton joins him , going across rear )</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>That 's east ?</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>Correct .</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>And how far am I from it ?</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>About six miles .</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>From Foreston , I mean ?</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>Six miles or more .</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>So far !</stage>
   <stage>( He walks back a little way , then stops and looks off up the valley . Harvey Anderson comes forward and begins to break some brush to replenish the fire )</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>Who is it , Harvey ?</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>I do n't know .</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>And it had the sign cut in the bark , eh ?</stage>
   <p>SILAS MAURY .</p>
   <stage>Yes .</stage>
   <p>WILLIE MAURY .</p>
   <stage>Two X 's and a spade .</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>That 's it , that 's it ! ‘ Two X 's and a spade , then dig nine feet . ’ There 's two bits , son . How did it happen , dad ?</stage>
   <p>SILAS MAURY .</p>
   <stage>It came up into the mill with the other logs , Lookin ’ just like ‘ em , but Willie spied the sign —</stage>
   <p>WILLIE MAURY .</p>
   <stage>Just as it was goin ’ into the saws .</stage>
   <p>SILAS MAURY .</p>
   <stage>And shouted to Chris Knudson . Chris shut down ; There was a crowd ; and then Aug. Jergens come And had it hauled away .</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>If you and me Had been out here , son , when all these were trees And you 'd a-spied that sign , I tell you what , I 'd hung some nuggets round this little neck .</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>You 'd better wait until the moon comes out . It 's a rough road back there .</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>There is a road ?</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>A logging road .</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>( Coming forward , notices the casts upon the ground )</stage>
   <stage>You 're searching for the mine ?</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>Cap and I here . These men are from the mill .</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>( With interest )</stage>
   <stage>From the mill down in Foreston , you mean ?</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>Leaving in search of work .</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>Are things so bad Down at the mill , my friends , that you must leave ? Are others leaving ? Have the men gone back ?</stage>
   <stage>( The men glare at him )</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>They 'll have to soon , they say ; their grub 's give out .</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>The Company has given them till to-morrow night To come to work or be shut out for good .</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>Have they brought in more men ?</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>They 're arranging to .</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>I do not see , friends , what you hope to gain By leaving Foreston and wandering off In search of work . In the first place I know , As you perhaps do not , that Egerton Has given orders to the neighboring plants To take on no more men until this strike Is settled , till it 's won . And , as you know , For forty miles around the mills are his , The camps are his . And where his power ends , Others begin that work in harmony With Egerton and Company . They are one , And have an understanding in some things Far more than you suspect .</stage>
   <stage>( Patten and Maury rise and walk aside and whisper together )</stage>
   <stage>And they all know Whatever be the outcome of this strike The effect of it will reach them all at last . If you men win , mill-workers everywhere Will take new heart and stand for better things . But if the Company wins , others will say — And with no little weight — ‘ We cannot pay The present scale of wages and compete With Egerton and Company . ’ So it will go Until the farthest mill in all this land Puts in its hand and takes a ten per cent Out of the wages of its workingmen . And there 's no power on earth that can prevent it .</stage>
   <stage>( Willie Maury rises and joins his father and Patten )</stage>
   <stage>But even were this not true , were places open , The same conditions would confront you there As now confront you here . At any time Those who employ you have you in their power And can reduce your wages when they choose , Lay on you what conditions they see fit , And you must either yield or be turned forth To wander on again . I do not know Whether you men have families or not , But others have , and their cause is your own . You cannot wander on for evermore , Picking up here and there a chance day 's work And hoping that to-morrow things will change , For changes do not come except through men .</stage>
   <stage>( The men return to the fire )</stage>
   <stage>And so I do not see just what it is You hope to gain by leaving Foreston . You cannot spend your lives on highways , friends . Where will you go ? Have you some place in mind ?</stage>
   <p>BILL PATTEN .</p>
   <stage>It 's none of your damn business where we go . We do n't wear no man 's collar .</stage>
   <p>SILAS MAURY .</p>
   <stage>Bill is right .</stage>
   <p>BILL PATTEN .</p>
   <stage>Nor Egerton 's , nor no man 's on this earth .</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>I beg your pardon , friends , I did not mean ——</stage>
   <p>BILL PATTEN .</p>
   <stage>We 're twenty-one years old and we 're free men .</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>I did not mean you had no right to go . You have .</stage>
   <p>BILL PATTEN .</p>
   <stage>You bet we have .</stage>
   <p>SILAS MAURY .</p>
   <stage>You can n't get men And want to scare us back , that 's what you want , Talkin ’ as how the mills will shut us out .</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>I have no wish to scare you back , my friend .</stage>
   <p>BILL PATTEN .</p>
   <stage>Then what 's your proposition ?</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>I have none .</stage>
   <p>BILL PATTEN .</p>
   <stage>Come up to shake hands , eh , and say , Good-bye ?</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>I chanced upon you here .</stage>
   <p>BILL PATTEN .</p>
   <stage>‘ Chanced ’ hell ! We know .</stage>
   <p>SILAS MAURY .</p>
   <stage>If it 's my rent you 're after , if it 's that , I think you might at least let that much go For what my boy did , findin ’ of the log .</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>Friends , you misunderstand me if you think That I am here to speak for any man , Or round you up , or lift one hand to stay Your coming or your going . You are free And can do what you please .</stage>
   <p>BILL PATTEN .</p>
   <stage>You bet we can , For all your bayonets .</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>My bayonets ?</stage>
   <p>BILL PATTEN .</p>
   <stage>Yes .</stage>
   <p>SILAS MAURY .</p>
   <stage>Think we do n't know you , eh ?</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>I do not know , I do not know what I can say to you . I understand just how you ——</stage>
   <p>SILAS MAURY .</p>
   <stage>( Plucks him by the sleeve and points off up the valley )</stage>
   <stage>There 's your home , Off there in that big mansion on the hill . Go there and live your life ; you 're none of us .</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>My father is my father ; I am I .</stage>
   <stage>( The men prepare to leave . Cap Saunders rises and begins to pack up the things )</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>We do not choose the gates through which we come Into this world , my friends . Nor you nor I Selected who should cradle us nor what home Should give us shelter . ‘ Tis what we do that counts , Not whence we come . Do not misjudge me , friends . Because I am a son of Egerton Deny me not the right to be a man .</stage>
   <p>SILAS MAURY .</p>
   <stage>You wear our sweat in your fine clothes all right .</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>I wear , my friend , what my own hands have earned . Where will you go ?</stage>
   <p>SILAS MAURY .</p>
   <stage>We 'll go where we can find ——</stage>
   <p>BILL PATTEN .</p>
   <stage>Do n't tell him , Si . Do n't you see through his game ? Keeps askin ’ where we 're goin ’ . Do n't you see ? He 's a spy of the Company .</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>Ah , you do not know Why I am here . God knows I did not come ——</stage>
   <p>WILLIE MAURY .</p>
   <stage>Thought we would n't know him .</stage>
   <p>SILAS MAURY .</p>
   <stage>Poor men are fools .</stage>
   <p>WILLIE MAURY .</p>
   <stage>He 's been Doggin ’ our footsteps .</stage>
   <p>BILL PATTEN .</p>
   <stage>You 've been followin ’ us To find out where ——</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>Do n't quarrel , men .</stage>
   <p>BILL PATTEN .</p>
   <stage>It 's a good thing Your old man crushed me till I pawned my gun , Or , God , I 'd kill you . Do you understand ?</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>Hold on there , pard .</stage>
   <p>BILL PATTEN .</p>
   <stage>So he could have the mills Blacklist us . Curse you ! And curse all your kind ! You 've ground us down until we 're dogs , damn you .</stage>
   <p>SILAS MAURY .</p>
   <stage>Come sneakin ’ round to ——</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>Friend , I did not come To spy on any man or seek you out Here on the mountains . For my hope has been ——</stage>
   <p>BILL PATTEN .</p>
   <stage>We 'll blow you up some day , you mark my word .</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>That never one of you would leave the ranks In your great struggle in the valley there , But that you would stand fast , and somehow win In spite of everything , starvation , death . And I have done all that I could to help you . But you , my friends , O you must understand , As there are some things that you cannot do , So there are things I cannot .</stage>
   <p>CAP SAUNDERS .</p>
   <stage>Get the pot .</stage>
   <stage>( The boy picks up the coffee pot )</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>How I came here I do not know myself . Some Power has led me though I know not why . I half remember that I could not sleep For voices round me in my father 's hall , And rose and wandered forth , fleeing from something That seemed to follow me across the waste , A sighing and a thundering of men . All day , it seems , I 've wandered over the mountains And all last night . Then from afar I spied Your fire here and came to learn my way .</stage>
   <p>SILAS MAURY .</p>
   <stage>Your way lies that way and our way lies this .</stage>
   <stage>( Patten , Maury , Cap Saunders and the boy go off through the darkness , right rear )</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>You must be hungry , pard .</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>No , thank you , no , Nothing to eat .</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>‘ Tai n't much , but what it is You 're welcome to it .</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>( Calling after the men )</stage>
   <stage>And you will go away And leave this great cause hanging in mid air ?</stage>
   <p>VOICE OF SILAS MAURY .</p>
   <stage>Tend to your business and we 'll tend to ours .</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>Do n't mind them ; they 're damn fools .</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>You understand What I have tried to say unto these men ; You understand , I know .</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>I think I do .</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>And something tells me we shall meet again .</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>Who knows ? I 'm tramping round , to-day one place , To-morrow another . I 'm a rolling stone . I never have been one to keep the trails . Just knock about the States and watch the plains For something — I do n't know — and yet ‘ twill come , And when she comes she 'll shake her good and hard . I do n't know what you 're rolling in your mind , But , as you say , it 's a great land we 've got . I like to lie and feel her under my back And know she tumbles to the double seas Up to her hips in mile on mile of wheat . Beyond that moon are cities packed with men That overflow . The fields are filling up . They 're climbing up the mountains of the West ——</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>( Looking after the men )</stage>
   <stage>And going on beyond them .</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>It 's all right . They 'll reach the coast off there or reach the ice , And then they 'll have to turn or jump on off . And they wo n't jump off . It 's too fine a land . Men throw away the hoofs but not the haunch . I sometimes see them in the dead of night Crawling like ants along her big broad back , With axe and pick and plow , building their hills And pushing on and on . It 's a great land . And bread tastes good that 's eaten in her air . And there 's enough for all here ——</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>Yes , ah , yes !</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>If we could just turn something upside down . I do n't know what you 've heard along the waste , But when you think it 's time to ring a change , And when you draft your men and call the roll , Write Harvey Anderson up near the top . And here 's my hand , pard . You can count on me .</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>We 'll meet again .</stage>
   <p>HARVEY ANDERSON .</p>
   <stage>Hope so . I like your face , And like the way you talk . Good-night .</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>Good-night .</stage>
   <stage>( Harvey Anderson takes up his pack and cast and goes off through the darkness after the other men . For a long time Harry Egerton stands looking after him . The fire has burned low )</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>Not that , not that ! And yet I know ‘ twill come . My God ! my God ! Is there no way , no way ?</stage>
   <stage>( Walks left and looks off up the valley )</stage>
   <stage>My father ! O my father !</stage>
   <stage>( He breaks out crying and , staggering about , falls first upon his knees , then face forward upon the ground . Instantly it becomes pitch dark )</stage>
   <p>THE DREAM VISION</p>
   <stage>( During the following , a shaft of light , falling upon Harry Egerton , shows him lying near the boulder . As he cries out , he partially rises , his form and face convulsed with anguish )</stage>

   <stage>( From up the mountain , full of pleasure )</stage>
   <stage>Harry ! Harry ! Come to the heights !</stage>

   <stage>Harry ! Harry ! Come to the valley !</stage>
   <p>THIRD VOICE .</p>
   <stage>( From far back , full of peace )</stage>
   <stage>Harry ! Harry ! plunge into the darkness , The abysses and the waterfalls and silence !</stage>

   <stage>You 're going mad ! You 're going mad !</stage>
   <p>HARRY EGERTON .</p>
   <stage>Mother ! mother !</stage>
   <stage>( Presently , about twenty feet up in the rear and on either side , faint lights begin to appear and faint sounds of music are heard . Gradually the lights brighten a little and the sounds of music become more and more audible until one becomes conscious that on the left an orchestra is playing and to the right a piano . One also becomes conscious of a vast and beautiful hall over the floor of which , as the music plays , the forms of dancers are gliding . Occasionally from here and there flashes a sparkle as of diamonds , and low rippling laughter is heard . In the foreground for a space of twelve or fifteen feet , cut off from the main hall by the faintest outlines of an immense arch , small groups of elderly people stand about watching the dancers , or saunter right and left into the adjoining apartments . In these apartments also people are seen moving about , and there is a hum of voices as of men and women in conversation . At no time does it become very light , and all that passes seems to pass in a dim shadow world .</stage>
   <stage>It is sufficiently light , however , to enable one to discern the grotesque richness of the hall which , as one sees at a glance , is an elaborate representation of a pine forest , the boles of the trees standing out in beautiful irregularity along the walls , the boughs above in the semi-darkness seeming to disappear in some sort of cathedral roof . There , all about , singly and in clusters , innumerable small globes as though the cones were illuminated . Between the trees , also in relief and life-sized , figures of men at work getting out timber . Forward right , teams dragging logs , and , on the opposite wall , a distant view of a river with rafts floating down . Standing on stumps , huge figures support the arched doorways , of which there is one in the rear wall right , and one centre in each of the side walls . Left rear , the grand staircase with the glow of some hidden lamp shining upon the landing . Here the carved scene upon the wall is that of an inclined trestle-work , with logs going up apparently into some mill above . Below , crouched upon the newel-post and the lower rail , the carved figure of a large mountain lion with a frosted light in its open mouth . Forward from the arched doorway , left , there is no wall from about four feet up , and through this open space , faintly illumined by small hidden lamps , a greenness as of palms and flowers .</stage>
   <stage>The music ceases and the couples break up . Later , the piano begins again , and just inside the main hall Gladys Egerton , in low decollete and holding her skirts above her ankles , appears dancing ravishingly to the music of the piano )</stage>
   <p>FIRST LADY .</p>
   <stage>Is n't she charming !</stage>
   <p>SECOND LADY .</p>
   <stage>And that 's George that 's playing .</stage>
   <stage>( Holding her skirts high the girl executes a graceful high kick and there is a clapping of hands )</stage>
   <p>MEN 'S VOICES .</p>
   <stage>Bravo ! bravo ! Once more like that , my kitten !</stage>
   <p>THIRD LADY .</p>
   <stage>Dear , you may have my Chester !</stage>
   <stage>( Laughter )</stage>
   <p>FOURTH LADY .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>THE MILL</speaker>
     <p>Scene : A street showing , right , the great lumber plant of the Egerton Company . Centre , occupying the greater part of the space between left and right , a sort of common , overstrewn , as such places usually are , with sawdust and waste sawings of the mill , extends back a hundred yards or so to where the river sweeps in from behind a rising slope on the left and disappears behind the high fence of the mill-yard on the right . Across the river , right , the same denuded mountains as were seen in the preceding Act , and , centre , the alluvial stretches of the valley widening out into the plains . Left rear , on this side of the river , a sort of hill comes in and upon its rather steep slope are rows of roughly built plank houses which have evidently been standing many years . They are all of one design and rest in the rear upon the ground , the front being propped up on posts , in some cases six or eight feet high . Of two or three of these shacks it would seem that the occupants had tried to have a garden , for here and there are small green patches as of late turnips , also tall stakes with withered bean vines clinging to them . From the numerous footpaths that come down toward the mill-gate it is evident that these shacks are the homes of the employees of the Egerton Company . The mill-yard on the right is surrounded by a high board-fence . New planks have recently been put in here and there , and on top of the fence , apparently just strung , are several rows of bright new barbed wire . Over the top of the fence and through the open gates of the driveway which is in the corner , a portion of the latter having been cut off for this purpose , are seen countless lumber stacks , and beyond these , far back and facing left , a section of an enormous mill . Along the comb of the roof , doubtless running its full length , is a large red sign with white letters of which one sees only : RTON AND CO . Before the entrance to the mill-yard two of the State militia with rifles upon their shoulders patrol the property , one of them pacing right and left along the street in the foreground , the other backwards and forwards in the open space that goes toward the river . About twenty feet from the entrance stands a large red automobile , under which , stretched upon his back , lies the chauffeur , with his hands up fixing something . As the Scene opens , the two sentries , one of them rolling a cigarette , the other with his gun behind his head and with his arms hanging over it , stand listening back toward the mill , where a number of voices are singing , ‘ There 'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town To-night . ’ When the song is finished a cheer goes up . Time : The afternoon of the next day about four o'clock .</p>

     <p>It all depends upon the mood they 're in . Sometimes a man can just sit on his horse , If the feed 's good ; and sometimes in the night , If a storm 's brewing , then it 's best to sing ; Go round them this way —<stage>Circles and sings one of the strange melodies of the cowboys</stage>for they 're restless then .</p>

      <l>Since we first organized . And what we 've won ,</l>
      <l>What is it that keeps it won ? The Union , comrades ,</l>

      <l>You heard Aug. Jergens what he said just now</l>

      <l>Logs you can n't handle , but you saw them up ,</l>

      <l>Or is it their mercy that you 're counting on ?</l>
      <l>Poor hold you 've got there . One window yonder</l>

      <l>Comrades , you 've come now where the ways divide .</l>
      <l>There 's bigger gates than these stand open here</l>
      <l>If you 'll just stick together . ‘ Tai n't to-day</l>

      <l>If you 'll just turn your faces from that gate .</l>
      <l>But if you 're going to give your Union up</l>
      <l>When they say if you do n't we 'll close these gates ,</l>
      <l>You 'll have no peace . They 'll hold it over you</l>

      <l>For this shore here ? It ai n't the one we want ;</l>
      <l>But here there 's bread and water . But they say —</l>

      <l>That Sam ai n't done his best to captain us ;</l>
      <l>He has . But here she is , she 's goin ’ down ,</l>
      <l>So I say land . For bread tastes mighty good ,</l>
      <l>And air this time o ’ year wo n't keep you warm</l>
      <l>If you 're turned out . Later , we get our strength ,</l>
      <l>We 'll patch her up and make for that green shore</l>

     <speaker>THE MANSION</speaker>
     <p>Scene : The great reception hall in the Egerton mansion . One sees at a glance that this is the original of the shadow hall shown in the Dream-Vision in the First Act . The carved mountain lion crouches upon the newel-post , and upon the walls the figures of men at work among the pines are identical with those of the Vision . But here , seen under a natural light , the grotesque grandeur of it all stands out in clear relief . Forward , left and right , just where the great arch separating the main hall comes down , groups of little pines in tubs lend a freshness to the scene . A brilliant company is gathered . Everywhere , from gestures and lifted eyes , it is evident that the mansion , especially the strange scene upon the walls , is the chief topic of talk among the guests . Centre right , about the piano , a number of young people are watching a couple that is out upon the floor , apparently practising a new step . Near the pines , forward left , General Chadbourne turns from the butler , with whom he has been speaking , to shake hands with some ladies . Later , Ralph Ardsley appears just inside the door , forward right , and holds up a glass of wine . Two or three men notice him and nudge their companions , and one after another saunter past Ardsley into the side room . Time : The same afternoon about five o'clock .</p>

     <speaker>MRS. ORR</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>In certain moods , perhaps I should .</l>
      <l>For certainly the trees seem most alive .</l>
      <l>I never would have thought it possible</l>

      <l>In wood as it does here . ‘ Tis wonderful .</l>

      <l>The very squirrels upon the limbs — see there ,</l>

      <l>Just now as the couple passed</l>
      <l>Practising , I overheard the girl ,</l>
      <l>‘ It almost seems the real pines are here</l>
      <l>Dropping their needles on us while we dance .</l>
      <l>As Lillian says , you feel them in your hair . ’</l>
      <l>Now , to my way of thinking , it would be</l>
      <l>Far easier to hear the pine trees sigh</l>
      <l>Than feel the needles .</l>

     <speaker>MRS. ORR</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Why , nothing , nothing at all . My dear , this is</l>
      <l>Really ridiculous . If it were old</l>
      <l>And there were cobwebs here and musty walls</l>
      <l>And rumors had come down of some old crime</l>
      <l>But with the timber , every stick of it</l>
      <l>Fresh from the forest , you might almost say</l>
      <l>Picked from your very garden , a pure bloom ,</l>
      <l>Fashioned and shaped by your own husband 's hand :</l>

      <l>We are living in an age in many ways</l>
      <l>Without a parallel . I sometimes think —</l>
      <l>If I may say it not too seriously —</l>
      <l>Of those last days we read of when the world</l>
      <l>Goes on its way unconscious of the end .</l>
      <l>We give and take in marriage , eat and drink ,</l>
      <l>And meet our friends in social intercourse ,</l>
      <l>And all the while a Spirit walks beside us ,</l>
      <l>Enters our homes and writes upon our walls .</l>
      <l>There are whispers everywhere if we could hear them ;</l>
      <l>And some of them grow louder with the days ;</l>
      <l>And pools of quiet ruffle and show storms .</l>
      <l>You , Governor , feel the popular unrest</l>
      <l>As it manifests itself in politics ,</l>
      <l>The shift of parties and of principles ,</l>
      <l>Rocks that we used to think would never change .</l>

      <l>When trouble-makers in the ranks of Labor ,</l>
      <l>Not only here in Foreston but elsewhere ,</l>
      <l>May find it to their interest to respect ,</l>
      <l>Nay , reverence as a thing ordained by God ,</l>
      <l>The right of men to earn their daily bread ,</l>
      <l>As well as profitable to obey the laws</l>

      <l>Some working with their hands on farms , in mines ;</l>
      <l>Some building ; some at forges ; at machines</l>

      <l>Suppose a bitter wind of discontent</l>
      <l>Should shake the great walls of this social order ,</l>
      <l>Set the first story men against the second ,</l>
      <l>The second against the third , until the mass ,</l>
      <l>Throwing their tools down on the world 's great floor ,</l>
      <l>Should clamor up the dome for pens and brushes ,</l>

      <l>All my life</l>
      <l>I 've wanted to say something to you , father ;</l>
      <l>Especially since I went to work . You once ,</l>
      <l>When I came home from college , you remember ,</l>
      <l>And had n't made my mind up what to do ,</l>
      <l>What my life work should be ——</l>
     </lg>

    <sp>
     <speaker>HARRY EGERTON</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>We talked together and you said that now</l>
      <l>Three things lay open to me , that I could choose</l>
      <l>And that you 'd back me up . First , there was Art .</l>
      <l>And though you did n't say so , I could see</l>
      <l>You 'd have been glad if I had chosen that .</l>
      <l>I had a talent for it , so you said ,</l>
      <l>And I could study with the best of them .</l>
      <l>You 'd set aside a hundred thousand dollars ;</l>
      <l>And I could finish up by travelling ,</l>
      <l>Seeing the beautiful buildings of the world ;</l>
      <l>That I could take my time , then settle down</l>
      <l>And glorify my land : that 's what you said .</l>
      <l>Then there was Public Life . You 'd start me in</l>
      <l>By giving me the Courier . That , you said ,</l>
      <l>Would give me at once a standing among men</l>
      <l>And training in political affairs .</l>
      <l>And that if I made good you 'd see to it</l>
      <l>I had a seat in Congress , and in the end</l>
      <l>That probably I 'd be Governor of the State .</l>
      <l>And then you paused . You did n't like the third .</l>
      <l>Business , you said , was an unpleasant life .</l>
      <l>‘ Twas all right as you 'd used it , as a means ,</l>
      <l>But as an end — And then you used words , father ,</l>
      <l>That changed my life although you did n't know it —</l>
      <l>‘ Business , my son , is war ; needful at times ,</l>
      <l>But as a life ,— you shook your head and sighed .</l>
      <l>With that we ended it , for some one came</l>
      <l>And I went out . Six years ago last June ,</l>
      <l>The seventh of June ; I can n't forget the day .</l>
      <l>The sun was shining but a strange new light</l>
      <l>Lay over everything . All of a sudden</l>
      <l>It dawned upon my mind that I 'd been reared</l>
      <l>Inside a garden full of flowers and trees ,</l>
      <l>And only now had chanced upon the gate</l>
      <l>And stepped out . There was smoke upon the skies</l>
      <l>And a rumbling of strange wagons in the street .</l>
      <l>I was afraid . For every man I met</l>
      <l>Seemed just about to ask , ‘ What side are you on ? ’</l>
      <l>And I was twenty-one and did n't know .</l>
     </lg>

      <l>I 'd always thought ‘ twas garden everywhere .</l>
      <l>I walked on up the river and sat down</l>
      <l>Upon the logs up there , and night came on .</l>
      <l>And in the waters flowing at my feet</l>
      <l>The lighted land went by , cities and towns</l>
      <l>And the vast murmur and the daily life</l>
      <l>Of those that toil , the hunger and the care .</l>
      <l>And in my heart I knew that it was true ,</l>
      <l>That what you said was true . And I came back</l>
      <l>Filled with such peace as I had never known .</l>
      <l>‘ I 'll enter business , father . ’ And I did .</l>
      <l>I started at the bottom in the mill</l>
      <l>Helping the engineer , and from the saws</l>
      <l>Carried the lumber with the other men .</l>
      <l>Then in the yard . You always praised my work .</l>
      <l>I 'm in the office now at twenty-seven ,</l>
      <l>And Secretary of the Company .</l>
      <l>I think I know the business pretty well .</l>

      <l>Or if I had a building half way up ,</l>
      <l>My masterpiece , a mighty capitol</l>
      <l>That finished would be known throughout the land ,</l>
      <l>And I had met with interference , men</l>
      <l>Who had no vision — you know what I mean —</l>
      <l>And I had come to you , ‘ Father , I 'm thwarted , ’</l>
      <l>O I can see with one sweep of your hand</l>

      <l>In these six years for one cause or another</l>
      <l>There 've been three strikes that have cost the Company thousands</l>
      <l>In money , to say nothing of those things</l>
      <l>That all the money in the world can n't buy .</l>
      <l>Now let me ask , my father , if this loss ,</l>
      <l>Instead of springing from these strikes , had come</l>
      <l>Through breakdowns of the machinery , or in the camps</l>
      <l>Through failure to get the timber out in time ,</l>
      <l>Would n't you have dismissed the man in charge ?</l>
      <l>Then why do you let Jergens run the mill ?</l>
      <l>Has n't he failed , and miserably , with the men ?</l>

     <speaker>HARRY EGERTON</speaker>

      <l>Is it because the earnings have increased ?</l>
      <l>Think what it 's cost you , father . In every mill</l>
      <l>Jergens has touched he 's left a cursing there</l>
      <l>That 's all come back on us . Why , my father ,</l>
      <l>Our name 's become a by-word through the State ,</l>
      <l>‘ As hard as Egerton . ’ And when I think</l>
      <l>Of what might be , the good-will and the peace ,</l>

     <head>THE LIVING MILL</head>
     <stage>Scene : Inside the mill , showing in front a sort of half storeroom , half office shut in from the main body of the mill by a railing in the centre of which is a gate that swings in and out . Far back in this main body of the mill one sees a number of great gang saws from which off-carriers , with freshly sawed slabs and lumber upon their rollers , branch right from the main line that runs the full length of the mill . Through an opening in the far end , whence the logs are drawn up an incline to the saws , one sees as through a telescope a portion of the river and of the mountains on the opposite bank . Up toward the front , left , in this main body of the mill is a wide door that opens outside . In the foreground , within the space partitioned off by the railing , a pair of stairs , evidently connecting with the outdoors on the ground floor , comes up rear left . Centre , against this left wall , a pole six or eight inches in diameter , and to all appearances only recently set , goes up through a hole in the roof . Upon the floor at the foot of the pole , from which two long ropes hang down , lies a large American flag partially strung upon the rope . Forward from the pole is a door which apparently is no longer in use , a strip being nailed across it . About this end of the enclosure are piles of window sash and kegs of nails . Centre rear , at right angles to the side walls , so that one sitting upon a stool may look back into the mill , is a long checkers ’ desk with two or three stools before it and with the usual litter of papers , books , and a telephone upon it . In the right wall , rear , where one coming up the stairs may walk straight on and enter , is a door connecting with the main office .</stage>
     <stage>As the Scene opens , something very important seems to be going on in this main office . A crowd of men , workmen and militiamen together , are packed about the door , intent upon whatever it is that is transpiring inside . Forward , away from the crowd , a small group , mostly of militiamen , is gathered about two guards with rifles in their hands , who have evidently just come in . Back , beyond the railing and close to the crowd , a group of workmen about Wes Dicey is engaged in a heated argument . And farther back in the mill , especially about the large door , left , are bodies of men talking together . As the Scene opens , and for a few minutes afterwards , some one up the pole is heard singing .</stage>

     <p>Yes .</p>

     <speaker>HARRY EGERTON</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>And God meant the mine for other things .</l>
      <l>And as administrators you and Sam</l>
      <l>And Buck I knew would carry on the work .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HARVEY ANDERSON</speaker>
     <p>But why just now ? Come on and tell me , partner . There 's something up . You ai n't been like yourself . There 's something on your heart . What is it , partner ? It ai n't the faction ?</p>

     <p>No .</p>

      <l>Come here to-night when we can be alone .</l>
      <l>There are some things I want to tell you , Harvey ,</l>
      <l>That you and Sam and Buck must carry out .</l>

    <stage>They go back through the gate in the railing and out through the great door , left , whence the crowd has passed . Rome Masters comes furtively up the stairs and looks about . He then comes past the sash to the door , forward left , and begins to pull off the strip that is nailed across it . He has just loosened it when Jim King appears upon the stairs and gives a low whistle . Rome Masters quickly joins him and together they hurry back through the mill and out the great door , left . A moment later the First Guard comes up the stairs , followed by Ralph Ardsley and Bishop Hardbrooke</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FIRST GUARD</speaker>
     <p>I 'll find him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP HARDBROOKE</speaker>
     <p>If you please .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The Guard goes back through the mill</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP HARDBROOKE</speaker>
     <p>I do n't like this . The atmosphere 's too charged with victory .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RALPH ARDSLEY</speaker>
     <p>I do n't believe they even know it 's cold .<stage>Looks about</stage>It 's wonderful the way he 's handled things . It 's that , I think , as much as anything That 's won the confidence of the citizens . I was just sure they 'd have a riot here .<stage>He gets up on one of the stools before the desk and takes from his overcoat pocket a newspaper which he spreads out before him</stage>I 've thought about it , Bishop ; do n't you think That that injunction Egerton got out Against the mine , considering everything , The public feeling — if he has good grounds For claiming that his own men found the mine — Aside from the reflection on his son — A tactical mistake , do n't you think so ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP HARDBROOKE</speaker>
     <p>Best not allude to that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RALPH ARDSLEY</speaker>
     <p>I think so too .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He reads the paper . The Bishop stands listening to the indistinct noises that come from the crowd outside</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RALPH ARDSLEY</speaker>
     <p>And yet you can n't blame Jergens very much . Something has got to happen pretty soon . Amalgamated 's off again , I see .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP HARDBROOKE</speaker>
     <p>Who is this Harvey Anderson ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RALPH ARDSLEY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>He 's the rough</l>
      <l>That kept the men from going back that day .</l>
      <l>Drew his revolver . Big man here now . You see</l>
      <l>He 'd been out on the mountains with a cast ,</l>
      <l>One of the men the Company had out .</l>
      <l>So it 's quite possible , as Jergens claims ,</l>
      <l>That Anderson found the mine . For gold these days —</l>
      <l>To get possession of a mine like that —</l>
      <l>Men have been killed for less .</l>
     </lg>

      <l>That ,</l>
      <l>That 's what I can n't get down me , his collusion ——</l>
      <stage>Cheers outside</stage>
      <l>It 's probably Anderson haranguing them .</l>
      <l>I do n't myself believe that Harry 'd do it .</l>
      <stage>Tremendous cheering</stage>
      <l>There 's certainly enthusiasm there .</l>

     <p>What is it , Editor Ardsley ?</p>

     <p>I do n't know .</p>

     <lg>
      <l>We 're neither of us , Bishop , what we were .</l>
      <l>We 've lost our power . Something 's happening</l>
      <l>That we do n't understand .</l>
      <stage>A pause</stage>
      <l>And done by men</l>
      <l>That live right here and walk the streets and talk ,</l>
      <l>Buy vegetables and pass the time of day .</l>
      <l>I tell you , Bishop Hardbrooke , you can n't tell .</l>

     <speaker>RALPH ARDSLEY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>If any one had said to me last week</l>
      <l>That that despondent crowd of shabby men ,</l>
      <l>After six weeks of battle against odds ,</l>
      <l>And beaten into silence , starved and cold ,</l>
      <l>Had in them the capacity for this —</l>
      <l>Who was it said we 're always in a flux ,</l>
      <l>That nothing 's fixed ? We do n't know anything .</l>
      <l>It 's like a case of type ; to-day it spells</l>
      <l>Egerton and to-morrow M-o-b .</l>
      <l>To think of Donald Egerton at bay !</l>

     <speaker>BISHOP HARDBROOKE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>These shouts once rose about the Church ,</l>
      <l>But somehow we do n't hear them any more .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RALPH ARDSLEY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Do n't think for a moment , Bishop , that you 're alone .</l>
      <l>We never had the tumult and the shout</l>
      <l>That you had in old days , but it 's all the same .</l>
      <l>The ‘ Power of the Press ’ ! It makes me laugh .</l>
      <l>If I could find a little farm somewhere ,</l>
      <l>I 'd sell my stock to Egerton and get out</l>
      <l>And let the world go hang . I 'm tired of it .</l>
      <stage>Cheers outside</stage>
      <l>Yes , there 's a ring about it you do n't hear</l>
      <l>Even in Conventions .</l>

     <speaker>BISHOP HARDBROOKE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>But I somehow feel</l>
      <l>We do n't get hold of it . The lower classes —</l>
      <l>They 're going off . I do n't believe it 's Christ .</l>
      <l>You say they 're leaving you ; and General Chadbourne —</l>
      <l>Two thirds , I think you said , of his command .</l>

     <speaker>RALPH ARDSLEY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>And Egerton —</l>
      <l>They certainly have left him . I thought last night</l>
      <l>As I sat looking up toward that new home —</l>
      <stage>Cheers outside</stage>
      <l>They 'll never light it up again that way ,</l>
      <l>The way it was that day . Did you ever see</l>
      <l>Anything to equal that reception hall ?</l>

     <speaker>BISHOP HARDBROOKE</speaker>

     <speaker>BISHOP HARDBROOKE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Harry ,</l>
      <l>We 've come to see if something can n't be done</l>
      <l>To end this controversy and bring peace ,</l>
      <l>An honorable peace to all concerned .</l>
      <l>A permanent state of strife is far from pleasant .</l>
      <l>There 's nothing sadder in the life of man</l>
      <l>Than to see towns disrupted , classes arrayed</l>
      <l>Against each other , to say nothing , Harry ,</l>
      <l>Of this far dearer tie that 's straining here ,</l>
      <l>That pains us all far more than we can tell .</l>
      <l>We 've often had these troubles in the Church ,</l>
      <l>Mostly in the past , of course , men differing</l>
      <l>Upon some point of doctrine or government .</l>
      <l>And my experience is that at the bottom</l>
      <l>There 's something that at first was overlooked ,</l>
      <l>Then , in the strife that followed , overwhelmed .</l>
      <l>There 's common ground , there must be in these things .</l>
      <l>Look at the world ; we pass along the street .</l>
      <l>We do n't confront each other and block the way .</l>
      <l>Each yields a bit and so we all pass on .</l>
      <l>And in relationships it must be the same .</l>
      <l>We 're one , my brother .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RALPH ARDSLEY</speaker>
     <p>Like our fingers here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP HARDBROOKE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>And when we 're not , when interests seem to clash ,</l>
      <l>It 's just as sure as Death or anything</l>
      <l>Some law of God is being tampered with .</l>
      <l>And so we thought we 'd come ——</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RALPH ARDSLEY</speaker>
     <p>And now 's the time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP HARDBROOKE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>For , as you know , in town the feeling 's growing</l>
      <l>That there 's a sword impending over us</l>
      <l>Which the least breath will bring down on our heads .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RALPH ARDSLEY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>And not in the town alone , but the whole State —</l>
      <l>They seem to have their eyes upon us here .</l>
      <l>You 've seen the papers how the strikes are spreading .</l>
      <l>The mills at Upton and the plant at Sawyer ,</l>
      <l>And down the State there 's Smith and Balding Brothers ,</l>
      <l>Heacox and Knight , twelve hundred men gone out ,</l>
      <l>Demanding unconditionally the mills .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP HARDBROOKE</speaker>

     <lg>
      <l>Not that you are to blame for it , we do n't say that .</l>
      <l>But probably without your knowing it</l>
      <l>A fire or something 's going out of you</l>
      <l>That 's kindling this industrial upheaval ;</l>
      <l>For it 's your name they 've made the war-cry , Harry .</l>
     </lg>

    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP HARDBROOKE</speaker>

      <l>Closing .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RALPH ARDSLEY</speaker>
     <p>I do n't think he meant it so . His heart 's out there , though , that 's as plain as day .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP HARDBROOKE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Harry , if these shouts mean a final step ,</l>
      <l>A closing up of things which if once closed</l>
      <l>Will render of no use any labor of ours ,</l>
      <l>I beg of you to call this meeting off ,</l>
      <l>At least until we see what we can do .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RALPH ARDSLEY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Postpone it , Harry , say till Monday morning .</l>
      <l>You know yourself how dangerous it is</l>
      <l>To wake men 's hopes to a wild dream of power .</l>
      <l>They 're never afterwards content with less</l>
      <l>Than that wild something that could never be .</l>

    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP HARDBROOKE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Yes , brother , let the Lord 's day with its peace</l>

     <p>Yes .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>RALPH ARDSLEY</speaker>

     <p>A Commonwealth of Workers .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP HARDBROOKE</speaker>
     <p>Then it 's true !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RALPH ARDSLEY</speaker>
     <p>Your purpose then is to retain the mill ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP HARDBROOKE</speaker>
     <p>Purchase it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HARRY EGERTON</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know . We 'll do what 's fair . We 've had to think first of supplying bread . That 's left but little time for other things .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP HARDBROOKE</speaker>
     <p>But if the Company should n't choose to sell ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HARRY EGERTON</speaker>
     <p>That is with them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RALPH ARDSLEY</speaker>
     <p>You mean you 'll still hold on ?</p>

     <p>That will be my advice , yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>‘ Thou shalt not steal . ’</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP HARDBROOKE</speaker>
     <p>It 's his association with these roughs .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RALPH ARDSLEY</speaker>
     <p>And they 'll never dare lay hands upon them , Bishop . I tell you the Commonwealth 's afraid to move .</p>

      <l>For six weeks , Bishop , and you never came .</l>
      <l>Why wait until the starving time is past ?</l>

      <l>To help along some Mission over sea</l>
      <l>Or roof some rising Charity at home ,</l>
      <l>I 've often wondered that he 's never seen</l>
      <l>Those little shacks upon the hill out there</l>
      <l>Nor heard the cry of widows from these saws .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP HARDBROOKE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I would suggest , my brother , that we leave</l>

     <speaker>BISHOP HARDBROOKE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>And put the guards they ask about the saws .</l>

     <speaker>CHRISTMAS EVE</speaker>
     <p>Scene : Inside the large room of a newly built board cabin up at the mine . Centre , rear , the open mouth of the tunnel , with the wall resting upon the rocks above . Left , in this same wall , near the corner , a door opening outside . Right , near the other corner , about four feet up from the floor , a small oblong window through which one sees the snow lying thick upon the mountains , and beyond the snow the dark of the sky with the winter stars shining brightly . In the right wall , well back , a door opens into a bedroom . Centre , in the opposite wall , a second door opens into a sort of woodshed . Left , a little way to the rear from the centre of the room , a heavy iron stove with chairs standing about . A woodbox is over near the wall , left . Forward right , a table with a bugle lying upon two or three sheets of loose paper , and , farther over , a heap of ore samples in which , with the light of the near-by lamp falling upon them , the gold is plainly visible . Harvey Anderson , his hat pulled low over his eyes , sits with his back to the bedroom , staring at the stove . The only motion discernible is an occasional pressing of the lip when he bites his moustache . Later , Mrs. Egerton , careworn and evidently in deep distress , enters from the bedroom and starts to say something to Harvey Anderson , but decides not to . Instead she goes to the window and stands looking out as though she were anxiously waiting for some one . Time : Christmas Eve .</p>

     <speaker>DOCTOR</speaker>
     <p>Yes , Colonel .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The Doctor goes out . Egerton shuts the door and stands for a moment apparently waiting till those who have just left get farther from the cabin . He then starts pacing to and fro as though he were undecided what to do . As he walks left toward Harvey Anderson his brow darkens . But as he turns right and draws near the bedroom the hard lines of his face relax . It is clear that a terrible struggle is going on within him</stage>

      <stage>To Harvey Anderson</stage>
      <l>You here alone ?</l>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FIRST STRANGER</speaker>
     <p>We 'll do the best we can .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The Second Stranger removes his overcoat . The First lifts the instrument case upon the table and begins to open it . Egerton walks toward the bedroom</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HARVEY ANDERSON</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Following him</stage>
      <l>I do n't believe —</l>

      <l>Well , partner , I 've seen men where Hell was loud</l>
      <l>Shoot from behind dead bodies but , by God ,</l>
      <l>I 've never seen them shoot from such as him .</l>

    <sp>
     <speaker>FIRST DETECTIVE</speaker>
     <p>At the outside .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The Second Detective hands to Egerton his son 's will , which , in buttoning the coat up about Anderson , he has found in the latter 's pocket</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EGERTON</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Looks into it a moment</stage>
      <l>Um !</l>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SECOND DETECTIVE</speaker>
     <p>The guard will be off duty ?</p>

    </sp>
    <stage>The Second Detective handcuffs himself to Anderson on the left side . The First Detective puts the cap on Anderson so that with the high collar of the coat turned up , only his eyes are visible under the poke</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HARVEY ANDERSON</speaker>
     <p>The black cap , eh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The First Detective then handcuffs himself to Anderson on the right side</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EGERTON</speaker>
     <p>You wire me when you reach the Capitol .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>FIRST DETECTIVE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Showing Anderson his pistol</stage>
      <l>Now not a word from you , you understand .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <stage>He puts the pistol in his side overcoat pocket and keeps his hand on it</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EGERTON</speaker>
     <p>‘ Twill soon be morning .</p>

    <sp>

    <stage>The detectives , with Anderson between them , go out</stage>

     <speaker>EGERTON</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>We 'll see , my man —</l>
      <stage>Puts the key on the outside of the door</stage>
      <l>How you 'll shake down the pillars of this land .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out and locks the door after him . A few moments pass . Suddenly at some distance outside a shot is heard . Again a few moments pass . Then , with a crash , the door is broken in and Buck Bentley , with the will in his hand , pulls himself hurriedly through the hole . He staggers to the table and seizes the bugle and blows a loud blast , then reels and , trying to steady himself , falls dead upon the floor , taking the table down with him . There is a clattering of the ore samples and a breaking of glass , and the lamp goes out , leaving the room in darkness . A half mile or so away , in the direction of Foreston , a bugle is heard , then , farther away , another , and fainter , another , and still another . And out through the window in the starlight of the Christmas morning soldiers with rifles in their hands are seen running rear left through the snow</stage>
