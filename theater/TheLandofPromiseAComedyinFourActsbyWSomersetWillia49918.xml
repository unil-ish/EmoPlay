     <stage>SCENE : The drawing-room at Miss Wickham ’ s house in Tunbridge Wells . It is a room in which there is too much furniture . There are armchairs covered with faded chintz , little tables here and there , cabinets containing china , a great many photographs in silver frames , porcelain ornaments wherever there is a vacant space , Chippendale chairs and chairs from the Tottenham Court Road . There are flowers in vases and growing plants . The wall-paper has a pattern of enormous chrysanthemums , and on the walls are a large number of old-fashioned watercolours in gilt frames . There is one door , which leads into the hall ; and a French window opens on to the garden . The window is decorated with white lace curtains . It is four o ’ clock in the afternoon . The sun is streaming through the drawn blinds . There is a wreath of white flowers in a cardboard box on one of the chairs . The door is opened by KATE , the parlour-maid . She is of respectable appearance and of a decent age . She admits MISS PRINGLE . MISS PRINGLE is companion to a wealthy old lady in Tunbridge Wells . She is a woman of middle age , plainly dressed , thin and narrow of shoulders , with a weather-beaten , tired face and grey hair .</stage>
    </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KATE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ll tell Miss Marsh you ’ re here , Miss Pringle .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>How is she to-day , Kate ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KATE</speaker>
     <p>She ’ s tired out , poor thing . She ’ s lying down now . But I ’ m sure she ’ d like to see you , Miss .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m very glad she didn ’ t go to the funeral .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KATE</speaker>
     <p>Dr. Evans thought she ’ d better stay at home , Miss , and Mrs. Wickham said she ’ d only upset herself if she went .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>I wonder how she stood it all those months , waiting on Miss Wickham hand and foot .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KATE</speaker>
     <p>Miss Wickham wouldn ’ t have a professional nurse . And you know what she was , Miss .... Miss Marsh slept in Miss Wickham ’ s room , and the moment she fell asleep Miss Wickham would have her up because her pillow wanted shaking , or she was thirsty , or something .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>I suppose she was very inconsiderate .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KATE</speaker>
     <p>Inconsiderate isn ’ t the word , Miss . I wouldn ’ t be a lady ’ s companion , not for anything . What they have to put up with !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Oh , well , everyone isn ’ t like Miss Wickham . The lady I ’ m companion to ,</l>
      <l>Mrs. Hubbard , is kindness itself .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KATE</speaker>
     <p>That sounds like Miss Marsh coming downstairs<stage>She goes to the door and opens it .</stage>Miss Pringle is here , Miss .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>NORAH comes in . She is a woman of twenty-eight , with a pleasant , honest face and a happy smile . She is gentle , with quiet manners , but she has a quick temper , under very good control , and a passionate nature which is hidden under a demure appearance . She is simply dressed in black .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I am glad to see you . I was hoping you ’ d be able to come here this afternoon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>Mrs. Hubbard has gone for a drive with somebody or other , and didn ’ t want me .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They kiss one another . NORAH notices the wreath .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>What ’ s this ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KATE</speaker>
     <p>It didn ’ t arrive till after they ’ d started , Miss .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I wonder whom it ’ s from .<stage>She looks at a card which is attached to the wreath .</stage>“ From Mrs. Alfred Vincent , with deepest regret for my dear Miss Wickham and heartiest sympathy for her sorrowing relatives .”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KATE</speaker>
     <p>Sorrowing relatives is good , Miss .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Remonstrating .</stage>Kate ... I think you ’ d better take it away .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KATE</speaker>
     <p>What shall I do with it , Miss ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m going to the cemetery a little later . I ’ ll take it with me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KATE</speaker>
     <p>Very good , Miss .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>KATE takes up the box and goes out .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>You haven ’ t been crying , Norah ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a little apologetic smile .</stage>Yes , I couldn ’ t help it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>What on earth for ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>My dear , it ’ s not unnatural .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>Well , I don ’ t want to say anything against her now she ’ s dead and gone , poor thing , but Miss Wickham was the most detestable old woman I ever met .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t suppose one can live all that time with anyone and not be a little sorry to part with them for ever . I was Miss Wickham ’ s companion for ten years .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>How you stood it ! Exacting , domineering , disagreeable .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I suppose she was . Because she paid me a salary she thought I wasn ’ t a human being . I never saw anyone with such a bitter tongue . At first I used to cry every night when I went to bed because of the things she said to me . But I got used to them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>I wonder you didn ’ t leave her . I would have .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s not easy to get posts as lady ’ s companion .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s true . They tell me the agents ’ books are full of people wanting situations . Before I went to Mrs. Hubbard I was out of one for nearly two years .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s not so bad for you . You can always go and stay with your brother .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>You ’ ve got a brother too .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Yes , but he ’ s farming in Canada . He had all he could do to keep himself , he couldn ’ t keep me too .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>How is he doing now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , he ’ s doing very well . He ’ s got a farm of his own . He wrote over a couple of years ago and told me he could always give me a home if I wanted one .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>Canada ’ s so far off .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Not when you get there .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>Why don ’ t you draw the blinds ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I thought I ought to wait till they come back from the funeral .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>It must be a great relief to you now it ’ s all over .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Sometimes I can ’ t realise it . These last few weeks I hardly got to bed at all , and when the end came I was utterly exhausted . For two days I could do nothing but sleep . Poor Miss Wickham . She did hate dying .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s the extraordinary part of it . I believe you were really fond of her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>D ’ you know that for nearly a year she would eat nothing but what I gave her with my own hands . And she liked me as much as she was capable of liking anybody .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>That wasn ’ t much .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>And then , I was so dreadfully sorry for her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>Good heavens !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>She ’ d been a hard and selfish woman all her life , and there was no one who cared for her . It seemed so dreadful to die like that and leave not a soul to regret one . Her nephew and his wife were just waiting for her death . It was dreadful . Each time they came down from London I saw them looking at her to see if she was any worse than when last they ’ d seen her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>Well , I thought her a horrid old woman , and I ’ m glad she ’ s dead . And I hope she ’ s left you well provided for .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a smile .</stage>Oh , I think she ’ s done that . Two years ago when I nearly went away she said she ’ d left me enough to live upon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>You mean when that assistant of Dr. Evans wanted to marry you ? I ’ m glad you wouldn ’ t have him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>He was very nice . But , of course , he wasn ’ t a gentleman .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>I shouldn ’ t like to live with a man at all ; I think they ’ re horrid , but , of course , it would be impossible if he weren ’ t a gentleman .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a twinkle in her eye .</stage>He came to see Miss Wickham , but she wouldn ’ t have anything to do with him . First she said that she couldn ’ t spare me , and then she said that I had a very bad temper .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>I like her saying that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s quite true . Every now and then I felt I couldn ’ t put up with her any more . I forgot that I was dependent on her , and if she dismissed me I probably shouldn ’ t be able to find another situation , and I just flew at her . I must say she was very nice about it ; she used to look at me and grin , and , when it was all over , say : “ My dear , when you marry , if your husband ’ s a wise man , he ’ ll use a big stick now and then .”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>Old cat .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>I should like to see a man try .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>How much d ’ you think she ’ s left you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Well , of course , I don ’ t know ; the will is going to be read this afternoon when they come back from the funeral , but from what she said I believe about two hundred and fifty a year .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s the least she could do . She ’ s had the ten best years of your life .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a sigh of relief .</stage>I shall never be at anybody ’ s beck and call again . I shall be able to get up when I like and go to bed when I like , go out when I choose , and come in when I choose .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Drily .</stage>You ’ ll probably marry .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Never .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>Then what ’ ll you do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I shall go to Italy , Florence , Rome . D ’ you think it ’ s horrible of me ,</l>
      <l>I ’ m so happy ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>My dear child .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>There is a sound of carriage wheels on the drive .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>There they are .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ d better go , hadn ’ t I ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m afraid you must .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>I do so want to know about the will . Can ’ t I go up to your room and wait there ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>No . I ’ ll tell you what , go and sit in the garden . They want to catch the four something back to London , and we can have a cosy little tea all by ourselves .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>Very well . Oh , my dear , I ’ m so happy in your good luck .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Take care .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MISS PRINGLE slips out into the garden , and a moment later MR. and MRS. WICKHAM enter the room . MRS. WICKHAM is a pretty young woman . She is dressed in black , but her gown is elegant and fashionable . JAMES WICKHAM is a clean-shaven , thin-faced man , with a baldish head . He is dressed in black and wears black kid gloves .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Cheerfully .</stage>Ouf ! Do put the blinds up , Miss Marsh . We really needn ’ t be depressed any more . Jim , if you love me , take those gloves off . They ’ re perfectly revolting .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>NORAH goes to the window and draws up the blind .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WICKHAM</speaker>
     <p>Why , what ’ s wrong with them ? The fellow in the shop told me they were the right thing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p>I never saw anyone look quite so funereal as you do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WICKHAM</speaker>
     <p>Well , you didn ’ t want me to get myself up as though I were going to a wedding , did you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Were there many people ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p>Quite a lot . The sort of people who indulge in other people ’ s funerals as a mild form of dissipation .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WICKHAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking at his watch .</stage>I hope Wynne will look sharp . I don ’ t want to miss that train .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>

     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , was that it ? I saw you looking a perfect owl , and I thought you were giving a very bad imitation of restrained emotion .</p>

     <p>Would you like some tea , Mrs. Wickham ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p>Well , you might send some in so that it ’ ll be ready when Mr. Wynne comes .<stage>NORAH is just going to ring the bell , but MRS. WICKHAM stops her with a pleasant smile .</stage>We ’ ll ring for you , shall we ? I daresay you ’ ve got one or two things you want to do now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Very good , Mrs. Wickham .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She goes out .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WICKHAM</speaker>
     <p>I say , Dorothy , you oughtn ’ t to be facetious before Miss Marsh . She was extremely attached to Aunt Louisa .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , what nonsense ! It ’ s always a very good rule to judge people by oneself , and I ’ m positive she was just longing for the old lady to die .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WICKHAM</speaker>
     <p>She was awfully upset at the end .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p>Nerves ! Men are so idiotic . They never understand that there are tears and tears . I cried myself , and heaven knows I didn ’ t regret her death .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WICKHAM</speaker>
     <p>My dear Dorothy , you oughtn ’ t to say that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p>Why not ? It ’ s perfectly true . Aunt Louisa was a detestable person and no one would have stood her for a minute if she hadn ’ t had money . I don ’ t see any use in being a hypocrite now that it can ’ t make any difference either way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WICKHAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking at his watch again .</stage>I wish Wynne would hurry up . It ’ ll be beastly inconvenient if we miss that train .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t trust Miss Marsh . She looks as if she knew what was in the will .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WICKHAM</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t suppose she does . Aunt Louisa wasn ’ t the sort of person to talk .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m sure she knows she ’ s been left something .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WICKHAM</speaker>
     <p>Oh , well , I think she has a right to expect that . Aunt Louisa led her a dog ’ s life .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p>She had wages and a comfortable home . If she didn ’ t like the place she could have left it .... After all it ’ s family money . I don ’ t think Aunt Louisa had the right to leave it to strangers .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WICKHAM</speaker>
     <p>We oughtn ’ t to complain if Miss Marsh gets a small annuity . Aunt Louisa promised her something of the sort when she had a chance of marrying a couple of years ago .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p>Miss Marsh is quite young . It isn ’ t as if she ’ d been here for thirty years .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WICKHAM</speaker>
     <p>Well , I ’ ve got an idea that Aunt Louisa meant to leave her about two hundred and fifty a year .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p>But what ’ s the estate ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WICKHAM</speaker>
     <p>About nineteen thousand pounds , I believe .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , it ’ s absurd . It ’ s a most unfair proportion . It makes all the difference to us . On that extra two hundred and fifty a year we could almost keep a car .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WICKHAM</speaker>
     <p>My dear , be thankful if we get anything at all .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Aghast .</stage>Jim !<stage>She stares at him .</stage>Jim , you don ’ t think ! Oh ! That would be too horrible .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WICKHAM</speaker>
     <p>Take care .<stage>The door opens and KATE brings in the tea-things . She puts them on a small table .</stage>How lucky it is we had a fine day , isn ’ t it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>It looks as if we were going to have a spell of fine weather .</p>

     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WICKHAM</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s funny how often it rains for weddings .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p>Very funny .<stage>Exit KATE .</stage>I ’ ve been counting on that money for years . I used to dream at night that I was reading a telegram with the news of Aunt Louisa ’ s death . And I ’ ve thought of all we should be able to do when we got it . It ’ ll make such a difference .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WICKHAM</speaker>
     <p>You know what she was . She didn ’ t care two-pence for us . We ought to be prepared for the worst .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p>D ’ you think she could have left everything to Miss Marsh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WICKHAM</speaker>
     <p>I shouldn ’ t be surprised .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p>We ’ ll dispute the will . It ’ s undue influence . I suspected Miss Marsh from the beginning . I hate her . Oh , why doesn ’ t Wynne come ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>There is a ring at the bell .</stage>

     <speaker>WICKHAM</speaker>
     <p>Here he is , I expect .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p>The suspense is too awful .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WICKHAM</speaker>
     <p>Pull yourself together , old girl . And I say , look a bit dismal . After all , we ’ ve just come from a funeral .</p>

     <speaker>KATE</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Wynne .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He enters and she goes out and closes the door . MR. WYNNE , the late Miss Wickham ’ s solicitor , is a tallish man with a bald head . He has the red cheeks and hearty manner of a man who plays in his spare time at being a country gentleman . He is dressed in mourning because he has been to Miss Wickham ’ s funeral .</stage>

     <p><stage>Somewhat helplessly .</stage>How do you do ?</p>

     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p>Of course , the end was not entirely unexpected .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WYNNE</speaker>
     <p>No , I know . But it must have been a great shock all the same .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WICKHAM</speaker>
     <p>My wife was very much upset , but of course my poor aunt had suffered great pain , and we couldn ’ t help looking upon it as a happy release .</p>

     <p>How is Miss Marsh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DOROTHY gives him a quick look , wondering whether there is anything behind the polite inquiry .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , she ’ s very well .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WYNNE</speaker>
     <p>Her devotion to Miss Wickham was wonderful . Dr. Evans — he ’ s my brother-in-law , you know — told me no trained nurse could have been more competent . She was like a daughter to Miss Wickham .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rather coldly .</stage>I suppose we ’ d better send for her .</p>

    </sp>

     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ll ring .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She touches the bell .</stage>
    <sp>

     <p>No , thank you very much . I never take tea .</p>

     <p>Mr. Wynne has brought the will with him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She sits down calmly . DOROTHY , with clenched hands , watches her . She tries to make out from her face whether NORAH knows anything .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WYNNE</speaker>
     <p>Miss Marsh , so far as you know , there ’ s no other will ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>How d ’ you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WYNNE</speaker>
     <p>Miss Wickham didn ’ t make a later one — without my assistance , I mean ? You know of nothing in the house , for instance ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quite decidedly .</stage>Oh , no . Miss Wickham always said you had her will . She was extremely methodical .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WYNNE</speaker>
     <p>I feel I ought to ask because she consulted me about making a fresh will a couple of years ago . She told me what she wanted to do , but gave me no actual instructions to draw it . I thought perhaps she might have done it herself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I heard nothing about it . I ’ m sure that her only will is in your hands .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WYNNE</speaker>
     <p>Then I think we may take it that this ....</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DOROTHY suddenly understands ; she interrupts quickly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p>When was that will made ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WYNNE</speaker>
     <p>Eight or nine years ago .... The exact date was March 4th , 1904 .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DOROTHY gives Norah a long , searching look .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p>When did you first come to Miss Wickham ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>At the end of nineteen hundred and three .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>There is a slight pause .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WYNNE</speaker>
     <p>Shall I read it , or would you just like to know the particulars ? It is very short .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p>Let us just know roughly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WYNNE</speaker>
     <p>Well , Miss Wickham left one hundred pounds to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel , and one hundred pounds to the General Hospital at Tunbridge Wells , and the entire residue of her fortune to her nephew , Mr. James Wickham .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DOROTHY gives a sharp inspiration of triumph . She looks again at NORAH , but NORAH gives no sign of emotion .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WICKHAM</speaker>
     <p>And Miss Marsh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WYNNE</speaker>
     <p>Miss Marsh is not mentioned .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a faint smile .</stage>I could hardly expect to be . At the time the will was drawn I had been Miss Wickham ’ s companion for only a few months .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WYNNE</speaker>
     <p>That is why I asked whether you knew of any later will . When I talked to Miss Wickham on the subject she said her wish was to make adequate provision for you after her death . I think she had spoken to you about it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WYNNE</speaker>
     <p>She mentioned three hundred a year .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>That was very kind of her . I ’ m glad she wished to do something for me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WYNNE</speaker>
     <p>Oddly enough she spoke about it to Dr. Evans only a few days before she died .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WICKHAM</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps there is a later will somewhere ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WYNNE</speaker>
     <p>I honestly don ’ t think so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m sure there isn ’ t .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WYNNE</speaker>
     <p>Dr. Evans was talking to Miss Wickham about Miss Marsh . She was tired out and he wanted Miss Wickham to have a professional nurse . She told him then that I had the will and she had left Miss Marsh amply provided for .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quickly .</stage>That isn ’ t legal , of course ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WYNNE</speaker>
     <p>What isn ’ t ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p>I mean , no one could force us — I mean , the will stands as it is , doesn ’ t it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WYNNE</speaker>
     <p>Certainly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WICKHAM</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m afraid it ’ s a great disappointment to you , Miss Marsh .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Lightly .</stage>I never count my chickens before they ’ re hatched .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WYNNE</speaker>
     <p>It would be very natural if Miss Marsh were disappointed under the circumstances . I think she ’ d been led to expect ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Interrupting .</stage>Our aunt left a very small fortune , I understand , and I suppose she felt it wouldn ’ t be fair to leave a large part of it away from her own family .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WICKHAM</speaker>
     <p>Of course , it is family money ; she inherited it from my grandfather , and ... but I want you to know , Miss Marsh , that my wife and I thoroughly appreciate all you did for my aunt . Money couldn ’ t repay your care and devotion . You ’ ve been perfectly wonderful .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s extremely good of you to say so . I was very fond of Miss Wickham . Nothing I did for her was any trouble .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WYNNE</speaker>
     <p>I think everyone who saw Miss Marsh with Miss Wickham must be aware that during the ten years she was with her she never spared herself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WICKHAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hesitatingly , with a glance at his wife .</stage>Of course , my aunt was a very trying woman .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Agreeably .</stage>Earning one ’ s living is always unpleasant . If it weren ’ t there ’ d be no incentive to work .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>NORAH gives her a glance of quiet amusement at this surprising remark .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WICKHAM</speaker>
     <p>My wife and I would be very glad to make some kind of acknowledgment of your services .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Thirty pounds a year .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p>Really ? Many ladies are glad to go as companion without any salary , just for the sake of a home and congenial society . I daresay you ’ ve been able to save a good deal in all these years .</p>

     <p><stage>Frigidly .</stage>I had to dress myself decently , Mrs. Wickham .</p>

     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p><stage>With all the charm she can put into her manner .</stage>Well , I ’ m sure my husband will be very glad to give you a year ’ s salary , won ’ t you , Jim ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s very kind of you , but I ’ m not inclined to accept anything but what ’ s legally due to me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Undisturbed .</stage>You must remember that there ’ ll be very heavy death duties to pay . They ’ ll swallow up the income from Miss Wickham ’ s estate for at least two years , won ’ t they , Mr. Wynne ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I quite understand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps you ’ ll change your mind .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t think so .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>There is a slight , rather awkward pause . MR. WYNNE gets up . His manner shows that he is not impressed by MRS. WICKHAM ’ S generosity .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WYNNE</speaker>
     <p>Well , I think I must leave you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WICKHAM</speaker>
     <p>We must go , too , Dorothy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quite at ease .</stage>Oh , it ’ ll only take five minutes to get down to the station in a cab .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WYNNE</speaker>
     <p>Good-bye , Miss Marsh . If I can be of any help to you I hope you ’ ll let me know .</p>

    </sp>
    <stage>He bows slightly to her , nods to WICKHAM and during DOROTHY ’ S next speech goes out .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Very friendly and affable .</stage>Jim will be writing to you in a day or two . You know how grateful we both are for all you did for our poor aunt . We shall be glad to give you the very highest references .</p>

     <p><stage>Relieved to be able to offer something .</stage>Oh , yes , we ’ ll do everything we can .</p>

     <p>You ’ re such a wonderful nurse , I ’ m sure you ’ ll have no difficulty in getting another situation . I expect I can find you something myself . I ’ ll ask among all my friends .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>NORAH looks at her reflectively , but does not answer . DOROTHY beams and smiles at her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WICKHAM</speaker>

     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Good-bye .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They bustle out and in a moment the sound is heard of wheels on the drive as the cab carries them away . NORAH is left alone . She stands staring in front of her . She does not hear MISS PRINGLE come in from the garden .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>I thought they were never going . Well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>NORAH turns and looks at her without a word .</stage>
    <stage>MISS PRINGLE is startled . ] Norah ! What ’ s the matter ? Isn ’ t it as much as you thought ?</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Miss Wickham ’ s left me nothing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>Oh !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Not a penny ! Oh , it ’ s cruel . After all , there was no need for her to leave me anything . She gave me board and lodging and thirty pounds a year . If I stayed it was because I chose . She needn ’ t have promised me anything . She needn ’ t have prevented me from marrying .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>My dear , you could never have married the little assistant . He wasn ’ t a gentleman .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Ten years ! The ten best years of a woman ’ s life , when other girls are enjoying themselves . And what did I get for it ? Board and lodging and thirty pounds a year . A cook does better than that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>We can ’ t expect to make so much money as a good cook . One has to pay something for living like a lady among people of one ’ s own class .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , it ’ s cruel .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Trying to console her .</stage>My dear , don ’ t give way . I ’ m sure you ’ ll have no difficulty in finding another situation . You wash lace beautifully , and no one can arrange flowers like you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I was dreaming of France and Italy .... I shall spend ten years more with an old lady , and then she ’ ll die , and I shall look out for another situation . It won ’ t be so easy then because I shan ’ t be so young . And so it ’ ll go on till I can ’ t find a situation because I ’ m too old , and some charitable people will get me into a home . You like the life , don ’ t you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>My dear , there are so few things a gentlewoman can do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>When I think of these ten years ! Having to put up with every unreasonableness ! Never being allowed to feel ill or tired ! No servant would have stood what I have . The humiliation I ’ ve endured !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>You ’ re tired and out of sorts . Everyone isn ’ t so trying as Miss Wickham . I ’ m sure Mrs. Hubbard has been kindness itself to me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Considering .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t know what you mean by considering .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Considering that she ’ s rich and you ’ re poor . She gives you her old clothes . She often doesn ’ t ask you to have dinner by yourself when she ’ s giving a party . She doesn ’ t remind you that you ’ re dependent unless she ’ s very much put out . But you — you ’ ve had thirty years of it . You ’ ve eaten the bitter bread of slavery till — till it tastes like plum cake .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rather hurt .</stage>I don ’ t know why you say such things to me , Norah .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Before NORAH has time to answer KATE comes in .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KATE</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Hornby would like to see you for a minute , Miss .</p>

     <p><stage>Surprised .</stage>Now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KATE</speaker>
     <p>I told him I didn ’ t think it would be convenient , Miss , but he says it ’ s very important , and he won ’ t detain you more than five minutes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>What a nuisance .... Ask him to come in .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>Who is he , Norah ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , he ’ s the son of Colonel Hornby . Don ’ t you know , he lives at the top of Molyneux Park . His mother was a great friend of Miss Wickham ’ s . He comes down here now and then for week-ends . He ’ s got something to do with motor-cars .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>KATE shows the visitor in .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KATE</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Hornby .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She goes out . REGINALD HORNBY is a good-looking young man , with a neat head on a long , elegant body . His dark , sleek hair is carefully brushed , his small moustache is trim and curled . His beautiful clothes suggest the fashionable tailors of Savile Row . His tie , his handkerchief protruding from the breast pocket , his boots , are the very latest thing . He is a nut .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>I say , I ’ m awfully sorry to blow in like this . But I didn ’ t know if you ’ d be staying on here , and I wanted to catch you . And I ’ m off in a day or two , myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Won ’ t you sit down ? Mr. Hornby — Miss Pringle .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>Funeral , I mean . Mother went . Regular beano for her .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MISS PRINGLE , rather shocked , draws herself up primly , but NORAH ’ S eyes twinkle with amusement at his airy manner .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Really ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>You see , she ’ s getting on . I ’ m the child of her old age — Benjamin , don ’ t you know .<stage>He turns to Miss Pringle .</stage>Benjamin and Sarah , you know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>I understand perfectly , but it wasn ’ t Sarah .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>Wasn ’ t it ? When one of her old friends dies , mother goes to the funeral and says to herself : “ Well , I ’ ve seen her out , anyhow .” Then she comes back and eats muffins for tea . She always eats muffins after she ’ s been to a funeral .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>The maid said you wanted to see about something .</p>

     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p>If you want to know , I recommend you to read your Bible .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p><stage>With much satisfaction .</stage>I thought it was a stumper .<stage>To NORAH .</stage>The fact is , I ’ m going to Canada , and mother told me you ’ d got a brother or something out there .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>A brother , not a something .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>And she said , perhaps you wouldn ’ t mind giving me a letter to him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I will with pleasure . But I ’ m afraid he won ’ t be much use to you . He ’ s a farmer and he lives miles away from anywhere .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>But I ’ m going in for farming .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Are you ? What on earth for ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve jolly well got to do something , and I think farming ’ s about the best thing I can do . One gets a lot of shooting and riding , you know . And then there are tennis parties and dances . And you make a pot of money , there ’ s no doubt about that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I thought you were in some motor business in London .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>Well , I was in a way . But ... I thought you ’ d have heard about it . Mother ’ s been telling everybody . Governor won ’ t speak to me . Altogether things are rotten . I want to get out of this beastly country as quick as I can .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Would you like me to give you the letter at once ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>I wish you would .<stage>NORAH sits down at an escritoire and begins to write a letter .</stage>Fact is , I ’ m broke . I was all right as long as I stuck to bridge . I used to make money on that . Over a thousand a year .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS PRINGLE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Horrified .</stage>What !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p><stage>Turning round .</stage>With what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>Chemin de fer . Never heard of it ? I got in the habit of going to Thornton ’ s . I suppose you never heard of him either . He keeps a gambling hell . Gives you a slap-up supper for nothing , as much pop as you can drink , and changes your cheques like a bird . The result is I ’ ve lost every bob I had , and then Thornton sued me on a cheque I ’ d given him . The Governor forked out , but he says I ’ ve got to go to Canada . I ’ m never going to gamble again , I can tell you that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , well , that ’ s something .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>You can ’ t make money at chemi . The cagnotte ’ s bound to clear you out in the end . When I come back I ’ m going to stick to bridge . There are always plenty of mugs about , and if you ’ ve got a good head for cards you can ’ t help making an income out of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Here is your letter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>Thanks awfully . I daresay I shan ’ t want it , you know . I expect I shall get offered a job the moment I land , but there ’ s no harm having it . I ’ ll be getting along .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Good-bye , then , and good luck .</p>

    <head type="act">ACT II</head>
    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>SCENE : The living-room and kitchen on EDWARD MARSH ’ S farm at Dyer , Manitoba . It is a room lined with brown planks , and on the walls in cheap gilt frames are coloured supplements from the Christmas numbers of illustrated papers . Over one door is the head of a moose , and over the other a large kitchen clock . The floor is covered with shiny oil-cloth . In the window are geraniums growing in maple-syrup tins . On one side is a large American stove . There is a dresser of unvarnished deal on which are plates and cups and saucers . They are of the plainest earthenware , and few of them match . There are two American rockers and a number of kitchen chairs . There is a plain kitchen table . On the stove is an enormous kettle and a couple of saucepans . There is a small bookshelf on which are a few tattered novels and some old magazines . The table is set for dinner with a cheap white cloth , none too clean . ED MARSH is sitting at one end , with the remains of a joint of cold beef in front of him , and at the other end is his wife , with a teapot , milk-jug , and sugar-basin . There is a loaf of bread on the table , a large tin containing maple-syrup , and the remains of a milk pudding . NORAH is sitting next to her sister-in-law and beside her is REGINALD HORNBY . Opposite are FRANK TAYLOR and BENJAMIN TROTTER . Dinner is just finished . GERTIE MARSH is a dark little person , with a hard look and a dried-up skin . She is thin and nervous , an active , hard-working woman with a sharp tongue and , outwardly at least , little tenderness . She is dressed in a shirt-waist , a serge skirt , and brown , rather smart high-heeled shoes . She wears a small apron . NORAH wears a white blouse and a green skirt . ED MARSH is a good-natured , easy-going man , with a small moustache and untidy hair . He wears a black flannel shirt , with white lines on it , a black waistcoat , and dark grubby trousers . The others are hired men . FRANK TAYLOR is a tall fellow , strong , with clean-cut features and frank , humorous eyes . He is clean shaven . His movements are slow and he speaks with a marked accent . He is very sure of himself . He wears a dark flannel shirt and a pair of overalls , which have been blue , but are now black and grimy with age . The braces which hold them up announce that they come from Eaton ’ s , Winnipeg . BEN TROTTER is an English labourer , with broken , discoloured teeth , and hair cut very short , with something like a love-lock plastered on his forehead . He is dressed in the same way as FRANK TAYLOR . REGGIE HORNBY ’ S head is still neat and trim , his hair is carefully brushed . His overalls are much newer than the others ’. He wears a flannel shirt which was obviously made in Piccadilly .</stage>

     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Was there more than my fair share ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>You use double the number of stockings than what I do . And everything else is the same .</p>

     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Say , Reg , is it true that when you first come out you asked Ed where the bath-room was ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a chuckle .</stage>That ’ s right . Ed told ’ im there was a river a mile and a ’ alf from ’ ere , an ’ that was the only bath-room ’ e knew .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>One soon gets used to that sort of thing , eh , Reg ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>Rather . If I saw a bath-room now it would only make me nervous .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Out in B. C . I knew a couple of Englishmen who were baching and the only other people around were Indians . The first two years they was there they wouldn ’ t have anything to do with the Indians because they was so dirty , and after that the Indians wouldn ’ t have anything to do with them .<stage>He puts his fingers to his nose to indicate a nasty smell .</stage></p>

     <p>You would .</p>

     <p><stage>Getting up .</stage>Are you going to sit there all day , Norah ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Why don ’ t you keep quiet for five minutes ? I guess Norah ’ s not sorry to have a rest after that wash .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>The amount of work Norah did isn ’ t going to tire her much , I reckon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m not used to that sort of work yet . It takes it out of me a bit .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve not found out what sort of work you are used to .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>NORAH gets up and the two women start clearing away the table . MARSH moves into one of the rocking-chairs and smokes .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Give her time to get used to the life , Gertie . You can ’ t expect everything all at once .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s always the same with English people . You have to teach them everything .</p>

     <p>Well , you didn ’ t have to teach me to propose , Gertie .</p>

     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I can ’ t honestly say that it makes the least difference to me whether you go or stay .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Now don ’ t start quarrelling , you two .</p>

     <p>When does your train go , Frank ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Half-past three . I ’ ll be starting from here in about an hour .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Reg can go over with you and he ’ ll drive the rig back again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>All right . I ’ ll go and dress myself in a bit .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>I guess you ’ ll be glad to get back to your own place .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I guess I shan ’ t be sorry .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The clearing away is finished . GERTIE gets a large metal basin and puts it on the table . NORAH fetches the kettle and pours hot water into the basin . They begin washing up .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ll do the washing , Norah , and you can dry .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>All right .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve noticed the things aren ’ t half clean when I leave them to you to do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m sorry . Why didn ’ t you tell me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>I suppose you never did the washing up in England . Too grand ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t suppose anyone would wash up if they could help it . It ’ s not very amusing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>You always want to be amused .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>No . But I want to be happy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>Well , you ’ ve got a room over your head and a comfortable bed to sleep in , three good meals a day , and plenty to do ; that ’ s all anybody wants to make them happy , I guess .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , lord !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Turning sharply on him .</stage>Well , if you don ’ t like Canada , why did you come out ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rising slowly to his feet .</stage>You don ’ t suppose I ’ d have let them send me if I ’ d known what I was in for ? Not much . Up at five in the morning and working in the fields like a navvy till your back feels as if it ’ ud break , and then back again in the afternoon . And the same thing day after day . What was the good of sending me to Harrow and Oxford if that ’ s what I ’ ve got to do all my life ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>You ’ ll get used to it soon enough , Reg . It ’ s a bit hard at first , but when you get your foot in you wouldn ’ t change it for any other life .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>This isn ’ t a country for a man to go to sleep with and wait for something to turn up .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>I wouldn ’ t go back to England now , not for nothing . England ! Eighteen bob a week , that ’ s what I earned , and no prospects . Out of work five months in the year .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>What did you do in England ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>Bricklayer , Miss .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>You needn ’ t call her miss . Norah ’ s her name . You call me Gertie , don ’ t you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>What with strikes an ’ bad times you never knew where you was . And the foreman bullying you . I don ’ t know what all . I ’ ad about enough of it , I can tell you . I ’ ve never been out of work since the day I landed . I ’ ve had as much to eat as I wanted and I ’ m saving money . In this country everybody ’ s as good as everybody else .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>If not better .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>In two years I shall be able to set up for myself . Why , there ’ s old man Thompson , up at Pratt , he started as a bricklayer , come from Yorkshire , he did . He ’ s got seven thousand dollars in the bank now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>You fellows who come out now have a much softer thing on than I did when I first came . In those days they wouldn ’ t have an Englishman , they ’ d have a Galician rather . In Winnipeg , when they advertised in the paper for labour , you ’ d see often as not no English need apply .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>Well , it was their own fault . They wouldn ’ t work or anything . They just soaked .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>It was their own fault right enough . This was the dumping ground for all the idlers , drunkards , and scallywags in England . They had the delusion over there that if a man was too big a rotter to do anything at all in England he ’ d only got to be sent out here and he ’ d make a fortune .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I guess things ain ’ t as bad as that now . They send us a different class . It takes an Englishman two years longer than anybody else to get the hang of things , but when once he tumbles to it he ’ s better than any of them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>I guess nowadays everyone ’ s glad to see the Englishman make good . When I nearly smashed up three years ago , I had no end of offers to help .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>How did you smash up ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I had a run of bad luck . One year my crop was frosted and then next year I was hailed out . It wants a good deal of capital to stand up against that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s what happened to me . I was hailed out , and I hadn ’ t got capital , so I just had to hire out .<stage>To NORAH .</stage>If it hadn ’ t been for that hailstorm you wouldn ’ t have had the pleasure of making my acquaintance .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Ironically .</stage>How hollow and empty life would have been without that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>I wonder you didn ’ t just quit and start out Calgary way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Well , I ’ d put in two years on my homestead and done a lot of clearing . It seemed kind of silly to lose my rights now . And when you ’ ve been hailed out once the chances are it won ’ t happen again , for some years that is , and by that time I ought to have put a bit by .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>What sort of a house have you got ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Well , it ain ’ t what you might call a palace , but it ’ s large enough for two .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Thinking of marrying ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Well , I guess it ’ s kind of lonesome on a farm without a woman . But it ’ s not so easy to find a wife when you ’ re just starting on your own . Canadian girls think twice before taking a farmer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>They know something , I guess .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Well , you took one , Gertie .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>Not because I wanted to , you can be sure of that . I don ’ t know how you got round me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>I wonder .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>I guess it was because you was kind of helpless , and I didn ’ t know what you ’ d do without me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>I guess it was love and you couldn ’ t help yourself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I ’ m thinking of going to one of them employment agencies when I get to</l>

    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>

    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>And d ’ you think you know anything about women ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I guess I can tell if they ’ re strong and willing . And so long as they ain ’ t cock-eyed I don ’ t mind taking the rest on trust .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>And what inducement is there for a girl to have you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s why he wants to catch ’ em young , when they ’ ve just landed and don ’ t know much .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve got my quarter section — a hundred and sixty acres , with seventy of it cleared — and I ’ ve got a shack that I built myself . That ’ s something , ain ’ t it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>You ’ ve got a home to offer and enough to eat and drink . A girl can get that anywhere . Why , they ’ re simply begging for service .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Some girls like getting married . There ’ s something in the word that appeals to them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>You seem to think a girl would jump at the chance of marrying you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>She might do worse .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I think you flatter yourself .</p>

     <p>I know my job and there ain ’ t too many as can say that . I ’ ve got brains .</p>

     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>What makes you think so ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Well , I can see you ’ re no fool .</p>

     <p><stage>With a chuckle .</stage>He put one over on you then , Norah .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p><stage>Good-humouredly .</stage>Because you ’ ve got no use for me , there ’ s no saying but what others may have .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>GERTIE takes the basin out in order to pour away the water . NORAH goes on drying the crockery .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Of course , there ’ s no accounting for tastes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I can try , can ’ t I ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s very wise of you to go to an agency . A girl ’ s more likely to marry you when she ’ s only seen you once than when she ’ s seen you often .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a wink at the others .</stage>It seems to make you quite mad , the thought of me marrying .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>You wouldn ’ t talk about it like that unless you looked down upon women . Oh , I pity the poor wretched creature who becomes your wife .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I guess she won ’ t have a bad time when I ’ ve broken her in to my ways .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Are you under the impression you can do that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Yep .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>You ’ re not expecting that there ’ ll be much love lost between you and the girl you — honour with your choice ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>What ’ s love got to do with it ? It ’ s a business proposition .</p>

     <p>What !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I give her board and lodging and the charm of my society . And in return she ’ s got to cook and bake and wash and keep the shack clean and tidy . And if she can do that I ’ ll not be particular what she looks like .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>

    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>You ’ re not going to abuse the whole British nation because I ’ ve broken a cup worth twopence , are you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>And the airs you put on . Condescending isn ’ t the word . It ’ s enough to try the patience of a saint .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , shut up .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>You ’ ve never done a stroke of work in your life , and you come here and think you can teach me everything .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t know about that , but I think I can teach you manners .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>How dare you say that ! How dare you ! You come here and I give you a home , you sleep in my blankets and eat my food , and then you insult me .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She bursts into tears .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Now then , Gertie , don ’ t cry . Don ’ t be so silly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , leave me alone . Of course you take her part . You would . It ’ s nothing to you that I ’ ve slaved for you for three years . As soon as she comes along and plays the lady ....</p>

     <p>Yep . That ’ s what Ed said this morning .</p>

    <stage>They go out . NORAH is left alone with REGGIE HORNBY .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a little smile .</stage>Well , are you enjoying the land of promise as much as you said I should ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>We ’ ve both made our bed and we must lie in it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>D ’ you remember that afternoon at Miss Wickham ’ s when I came for a letter to your brother ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I hadn ’ t much intention of coming to Canada then .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t mind telling you that I mean to get back to England the very first opportunity I get . I ’ m willing to give away my share of the White Man ’ s Burden with a packet of chewing gum .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>You prefer the Effete East ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>Rather . Give me the degrading influence of a decadent civilisation every time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Your father will be pleased to see you , won ’ t he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t think . Of course , I was a damned fool ever to leave Winnipeg .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I understand you didn ’ t till you were forced to .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>Your brother behaved like a perfect brick . I sent him on your letter and told him I was up against it — d ’ you know I hadn ’ t got a bob ? I was jolly glad to earn half a dollar by digging a pit in a man ’ s garden . Bit thick , you know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laughing .</stage>I can see you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>Your brother sent me my fare to come here and told me I could do the chores . I didn ’ t know what they were . I found out it was doing all the jobs that it wasn ’ t anybody else ’ s job to do . And they call it God ’ s own country .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Meanwhile NORAH has put a couple of irons on the stove and now she gets the board . It is rather heavy for her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I think you ’ re falling into the ways very well .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>What makes you think that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a smile .</stage>You can sit by and smoke your pipe , and watch me carry the ironing board about .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Without moving .</stage>D ’ you want me to help you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>No .... It would remind me of home .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>I suppose I shall have to stick it out at least a year , unless I can humbug the mater into sending me enough money to get home with .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>She won ’ t send you a penny if she ’ s wise .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>Wouldn ’ t you chuck it if you could ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a flash of spirit .</stage>And acknowledge myself beaten ?<stage>There is a short pause .</stage>You don ’ t know what I went through before I came here . I tried to get another position as lady ’ s companion . I answered advertisements . I hung about the agent ’ s offices .... Two people offered to take me without a salary . One woman suggested ten shillings a week and my lunch . She expected me to find myself a room , clothes , breakfast and supper on ten shillings a week . That settled me . I wrote to Eddie and said I was coming . When I ’ d paid my fare I had eight pounds in the world . That ’ s the result of ten years ’ work as lady ’ s companion . When he came to meet me at the station at Dyer ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t call it a station , call it a depôt .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>My whole fortune consisted of seven dollars and thirty-five cents .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MARSH comes in and gives HORNBY a glance .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>What about that wood you were splitting , Reg ? You ’ d better be getting on with it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , lord , is there no rest for the wicked ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He gets up slowly and saunters lazily to the door .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t hurry yourself , will you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>Brilliant sarcasm is just flying about the house to-day .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s about the toughest nut I ’ ve ever been set to crack . Why on earth did you give him a letter to me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>He asked me . I couldn ’ t very well say no .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Throughout the scene NORAH goes on ironing things which she takes from a pile of washing in the basket .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>I can ’ t make out what people are up to in the Old Country . They think that if a man is too big a rotter to do anything at all in England they ’ ve only got to send him out here and he ’ ll make a fortune .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>He may improve .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a look at NORAH .</stage>You ’ ve thoroughly upset Gertie .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>She ’ s very easily upset , isn ’ t she ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s only since you came that things haven ’ t gone right . We never used to have scenes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Do you blame me ? I came prepared to like her and help her . She met all my advances with suspicion .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>She thinks you look down upon her . You ought to remember that she never had your opportunities . She ’ s earned her own living from the time she was thirteen . You can ’ t expect in her the refinements of a woman who ’ s led the protected life that you have .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I haven ’ t said a word that could be turned into the least suggestion of disapproval of anything she did .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>My dear , your whole manner has expressed disapproval . You won ’ t do things in the way we do them . After all , the way you lived in Tunbridge Wells isn ’ t the only way people can live . Our ways suit us , and when you live amongst us you must adopt them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>She never gave me a chance to learn them . She treated me with suspicion and enmity from the very first day I came here . When she sneered at me because I talked of a station instead of a depôt , of course I went on talking of a station . Because I prefer to drink water with my meals instead of strong tea she said I was putting on side .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Why can ’ t you humour her ? You see , you ’ ve got to take the blame for all the English people who came here in the past and were lazy , worthless , and supercilious . They called us Colonials and turned up their noses at us . What d ’ you expect us to do ? Say , “ Thank you very much , sir ; we know we ’ re not worthy to black your boots ; and don ’ t bother to work — it ’ ll be a pleasure for us to give you money ”? It ’ s no good blinking the fact , there was a great prejudice against the English , but it ’ s giving way now , and every sensible man and woman who comes out can do something to destroy it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a shrug of the shoulders .</stage>If you ’ re tired of having me here I can go back to Winnipeg . I shan ’ t have any difficulty in finding something to do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Good lord , I don ’ t want you to go . I like having you here , and it ’ s company for Gertie . And you know , jobs aren ’ t so easy to find as you think , especially now the winter ’ s coming on . Everyone wants a job in the city .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>What d ’ you want me to do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Well , you ’ ve got to live with Gertie . Why can ’ t you make the best of things and meet her half way ? You might make allowances for her even if you think her unreasonable .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ll have a try .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>I think you ought to apologise for what you said to her just now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I ? I ’ ve got nothing to apologise for . She drove me to distraction .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>There is a moment ’ s pause . MARSH , now that he has come to the object of all he has been saying , is a little embarrassed .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>She says she won ’ t speak to you again until you beg her pardon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Does she look upon that as a great hardship ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>My dear , we ’ re twelve miles from the nearest store . We ’ re thrown upon one another through the whole of the winter . Last year there was a bad blizzard , and for six weeks we didn ’ t see a soul outside the farm . Unless we learn to put up with one another ’ s whims life becomes a perfect hell .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>You can go on talking all night , Eddie — I ’ ll never apologise . Time after time when she sneered at me till my blood boiled . I ’ ve kept my temper . She deserved ten times more than I said . D ’ you think I ’ m going to knuckle under to a woman like that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Remember she ’ s my wife , Norah .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Why didn ’ t you marry a lady ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>What the dickens d ’ you think is the use of being a lady out here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>You ’ ve degenerated since you left England .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Now , look here , my dear , I ’ ll just tell you what Gertie did for me . She was a waitress in Winnipeg at the Minnedosa Hotel , and she was making money . She knew what the life was on a farm , much harder than anything she ’ d been used to in the city , but she accepted all the hardship of it , and the monotony — because she loved me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>She thought it a good match . You were a gentleman .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Fiddledidee . She had the chance of much better men than me .... And when I lost my harvest two years running , d ’ you know what she did ? She went back to the hotel in Winnipeg for the winter so as to carry things on till the next harvest . And at the end of the winter she gave me every cent she ’ d earned to pay the interest of my mortgage and the instalments on the machinery .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>There is a pause .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Very well , I ’ ll apologise . But leave me alone with her . I — I don ’ t think</l>
      <l>I could do it before anyone else .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>All right . I ’ ll go and tell her .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out . NORAH is left alone with her thoughts . In a moment GERTIE comes back , followed by MARSH .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Trying to take things lightly .</stage>I ’ ve been getting on with the ironing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>Have you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a smile .</stage>That is one of the few things I can do all right .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>Any child can iron .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Well , I ’ ll be going down to the shed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Turning to him quickly .</stage>What for ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>I want to see about mending that door . It hasn ’ t been closing properly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>I thought Norah had something to say to me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s what I ’ m going to leave you alone for .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>I like that . She insults me before everybody and then when she ’ s going to apologise it ’ s got to be private . No , thank you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>What d ’ you mean , Gertie ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>You sent Ed in to tell me you was going to apologise for what you ’ d said , didn ’ t you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>For peace and quietness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>Well , what you said was before the men , and it ’ s before the men you must say you ’ re sorry .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>How can you ask me to do such a thing !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t be rough on her , Gertie . No one likes apologising .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>People who don ’ t like apologising should keep a better lookout on their tongue .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>It can ’ t do you any good to have her eat humble pie before the men .</p>

     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps not , but it ’ ll do her good .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Gertie , don ’ t be cruel . I ’ m sorry if I lost my temper just now and said anything that hurt you . Please don ’ t make me humiliate myself before the others .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve made up my mind , so it ’ s no good talking .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t you see it ’ s bad enough to beg your pardon before Eddie ?</p>

    </sp>

     <p>What on earth d ’ you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>If you don ’ t make her apologise right now before the hired men I ’ m quit of you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>I can ’ t make her apologise if she won ’ t .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>Then let her quit .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I wish I could . I wish to God I could .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>You know she can ’ t do that . There ’ s nowhere she can go . I ’ ve offered her a home . You were quite willing when I suggested having her here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>I was willing because I thought she ’ d make herself useful . We can ’ t afford to feed folks as don ’ t earn their keep . We have to work for our money , we do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I didn ’ t know you grudged me the little I eat . I wonder if I should if I were in your place .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Look here , it ’ s no good talking . I ’ m not going to turn her out . As long as she wants a home the farm ’ s open to her . And she ’ s welcome to everything I ’ ve got .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>Then you choose her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Irritably .</stage>I don ’ t know what you ’ re talking about .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>I said you ’ d got to choose between us . Very well . Let her stay . I earned my living before , and I can earn it again . I ’ m going .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t talk such nonsense .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>You think I don ’ t mean it ? D ’ you think I ’ m going to stay here and be put upon ? Why should I ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t you — love me any more ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>Haven ’ t I shown that I love you ? Have you forgotten , Ed ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>We ’ ve gone through so much together , darling .</p>
    </sp>

     <p><stage>Hesitatingly .</stage>Yes , we have that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Won ’ t you forgive her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>No , I can ’ t . You ’ re a man , you don ’ t understand . If she won ’ t apologise , either she must go or I shall .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>I can ’ t lose you , Gertie . What should I do without you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>I guess you know me well enough by now . When I say a thing I do it .</p>

     <p><stage>Ill at ease .</stage>After all , she ’ s my wife . If it weren ’ t for her I should be hiring out now at forty dollars a month .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>NORAH hesitates for a moment , then she makes up her mind .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hoarsely .</stage>Very well , I ’ ll do what you want .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>You do insist on it , Gertie ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>Of course I do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ll go and call the men .</p>

     <p>Frank Taylor needn ’ t come , need he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>Why not ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>He ’ s going away to-day . It can ’ t much matter about him , surely .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>Why are you so particular about it , then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>The others are English . He ’ ll like to see me humiliated . He looks upon women as dirt . He ’ s .... Oh , I don ’ t know , but not before him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>It ’ ll do you a world of good to be taken down a peg or two , my lady .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , how heartless — how cruel .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>Go on , Ed — I want to get on with my work .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MARSH hesitates a moment , then shrugs his shoulders and goes out .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Passionately .</stage>Why do you humiliate me like this ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>You came here and thought you knew everything , I guess . You didn ’ t know who you ’ d got to deal with .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I was a stranger and homeless . If you ’ d had any kindness you wouldn ’ t have treated me so . I wanted to be fond of you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>You despised me before you ever saw me .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>NORAH covers her eyes for a moment with both hands , and then forces herself to make another appeal .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Gertie , can ’ t we be friends ? Can ’ t we let bygones be bygones and start afresh ? We ’ re both fond of Eddie . He ’ s your husband and you love him , and he ’ s the only relation I have in the world . Won ’ t you let me be a real sister to you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s rather late to say all that now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>But it ’ s not too late , is it ? I don ’ t know what I do that irritates you . I can see how competent you are , and I admire you so much . I know how splendid you ’ ve been with Eddie , and how you ’ ve stuck to him through thick and thin . You ’ ve done everything for him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Breaking in violently .</stage>Oh , don ’ t go on patronising me . I shall go crazy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Astounded .</stage>Patronising you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>You talk to me as if I was a naughty child . You might be a school teacher .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>It seems perfectly hopeless .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>Even when you ’ re begging my pardon you put on airs . You ask me to forgive you as if you was doing me a favour .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a chuckle .</stage>I must have a very unfortunate manner .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Furiously .</stage>Don ’ t laugh at me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t make yourself ridiculous , then .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>D ’ you think I shall ever forget what you wrote to Ed before I married him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking at her quickly .</stage>I don ’ t know what you mean .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t you ? You told him it would be a disgrace if he married me . He was a gentleman and I .... Oh , you spread yourself out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>He oughtn ’ t to have shown you the letter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>He was dotty about me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I had a perfect right to try and prevent the marriage before it took place . But after it happened I only wanted to make the best of it . If you had a grudge against me why did you let me come here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>Ed wanted it , and it was lonely enough sometimes with the men away all day and no one to talk to . I thought you ’ d be company for me .... I can ’ t bear it when Ed talks to you about the Old Country and people I don ’ t know nothing about .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Surprised .</stage>Are you jealous ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s my house and I ’ m mistress here . I won ’ t be put upon . What did you want to come here for , upsetting everybody ? Till you come I never had a word with Ed . Oh , I hate you , I hate you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Gertie .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>You ’ ve given me a chance and I ’ m going to take it . I ’ m going to take you down a peg or two .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>You ’ re doing all you can to drive me away from here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTIE</speaker>
     <p>You don ’ t think it ’ s much catch to have you . You talk of getting a job — you couldn ’ t get one . I know something about that , my girl . You ! You can do nothing .... Here they are . Now take your medicine .</p>

    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>SCENE : FRANK TAYLOR ’ S shack at Prentice , Manitoba . It is a low log cabin , consisting of two rooms . The scene is the living-room . There is a door at the back towards the left-hand side , and on the right is another door that leads into the bedroom . A very small low window at the back . There is a stove on the left , with a long chimney . On the walls , untidily tacked up , are pictures cut out of the illustrated papers . Hanging on a nail is a Cariboo coat . On a shelf beside the stove are the few pots and pans that FRANK TAYLOR possesses . They are battered and much used . There is a broom in the corner . The furniture consists of a rocking-chair , worn with use and shabby , a table roughly made by TAYLOR himself from packing-cases , one kitchen chair and two or three packing-cases used as stools . On another shelf are maple-syrup tins , in which groceries are kept . In one corner there is an old suit-case , locally known as a grip , and a heap of old clothes ; in another corner is a pile of tattered magazines and numbers of the Winnipeg Free Press . The shack has an untidy , comfortless , bedraggled air .</stage>
     <stage>When the curtain rises the scene is dark and empty . There is a faint glimmer of light through the window . The night is bright and starry . There is a slight noise of a rig being driven up outside , and then voices are heard .</stage>
    </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SHARP</speaker>
     <p>Woa there ! Woa !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>A tidy pull , that last bit . Trail ’ s very bad .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SHARP</speaker>
     <p>Stop still , you brute .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I guess she wants to get home .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Now comes the sound of a key being put into the lock . It is turned noisily and the door is opened wide . A rig stands outside and SHARP is seen still seated holding the reins . NORAH has just got down . Tied on the back of the rig are NORAH ’ S trunk and TAYLOR ’ S grip . There is a glimpse of the prairie and the bright Canadian night . TAYLOR comes in . He is wearing a waterproof coat lined with sheepskin , a dark , roughly cut suit of some coarse blue material , and a broad-brimmed , flat-crowned hat .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Wait a minute , and I ’ ll light the lamp .<stage>He strikes a match and looks round .</stage>Where in hell has it got to ? The shack ’ s about two foot by three , and I ’ m blamed if I can ever find a darned thing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SHARP</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ll give you a hand with that trunk .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>As he speaks he begins to get down . TAYLOR finds the lamp and lights it .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ll come and help you if you ’ ll wait a bit . Come in , Norah .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SHARP</speaker>
     <p>Woa there !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>NORAH comes in . She has on a hat and coat . She carries a string bag in which there is a number of parcels .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m quite stiff after that long drive .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Are you cold ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>No , not a bit . I was well wrapped up .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I guess it ’ s freezing . But it ’ s your first winter and you won ’ t feel the cold like we do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Putting down her bag .</stage>I ’ ll bring some of the things in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t touch the trunk , it ’ s too heavy for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m as strong as a horse .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Don ’ t touch it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a smile .</stage>I won ’ t .</p>

    <stage>He goes out and takes more parcels out of the rig and comes in with them .</stage>

     <p>We can all do with a cup of tea . Just have a look at the stove . It won ’ t take two shakes to light a fire .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>It seems hardly worth while . It ’ s so late .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p><stage>Cheerily .</stage>Light the fire , my girl , and don ’ t talk about it .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out and is seen helping SHARP to unfasten the trunk . NORAH , getting down on her knees , rakes out the ashes from the stove . TAYLOR and SHARP bring the box in between them . SHARP is a rough-looking man of forty . He has been a non-commissioned officer in an English regiment , and has still something of a soldier ’ s look .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SHARP</speaker>
     <p>This trunk of yours isn ’ t what you might call light , Mrs. Taylor .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>It contains all I own in the world .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I guess it don ’ t do that . Since this morning you own a half share in a hundred and sixty acres of as good land as there is in Manitoba and a mighty fine shack .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>To say nothing of a husband .</p>

     <p>Where d ’ you want this put ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>It ’ ud better go in the next room right away , or we shall be falling over it .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They carry the trunk into the bedroom . NORAH gets up from her knees , goes over to a pile of logs by the stove , and takes two or three and some of the newspapers . The men come in again .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Here , you won ’ t be able to light a fire with logs like that . Where ’ s that darned axe ?<stage>He glances round and sees it by the logs . He takes a couple and splits them .</stage>I guess you ’ ll have plenty to do getting the shack tidy .<stage>SHARP brings in TAYLOR ’ S grip and his gun .</stage>Now , that ’ s real good of you , Sid .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SHARP</speaker>
     <p>Get any shooting down at Dyer , Frank ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>There was a rare lot of prairie chickens around , but I didn ’ t get out more than a couple of days .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SHARP</speaker>
     <p>Well , I ’ ll be getting back home now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Oh , stay and have a cup of tea , won ’ t you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SHARP</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t think I will . It ’ s getting late and the mare ’ ll get cold .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Put her in the shed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SHARP</speaker>
     <p>No , I think I ’ ll be toddling . My missus says I was to give you her compliments , Mrs. Taylor , and she ’ ll be round to-morrow to see if there ’ s anything you want .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s very kind of her . Thank you very much .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Sid lives where you saw that light just about a mile from here , Norah . Mrs. Sharp ’ ll be able to help you a lot at first .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SHARP</speaker>
     <p>Oh , well , we ’ ve been here for thirteen years , and we know the way of the country by now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Norah ’ s about as green as a new dollar bill , I guess .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SHARP</speaker>
     <p>There ’ s a lot you can ’ t be expected to know at first . I ’ ll say good-night , then , and good luck .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Well , good-night then , Sid , if you won ’ t stay , and it was real good of you to come and fetch us in the rig .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SHARP</speaker>
     <p>Oh , that ’ s all right . Good-night to you , Mrs. Taylor .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Good-night .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>SHARP goes out , gets on the rig , and drives away .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I guess it must seem funny to you to hear him call you Mrs. Taylor , eh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>NORAH gives him a quick look , and represses a little shudder .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>How are you getting on with that fire ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>All right .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I guess I ’ ll get some water .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He takes a pail and goes out . He is heard pumping . NORAH gets up , lifts the lamp so as to see better , and looks round . She is pale , and has a frightened look . She does not hear FRANK come in , and starts violently when he speaks to her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Having a look at the shack ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Putting the lamp down .</stage>How you startled me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>What d ’ you think of it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I built it with my own hands . Every one of them logs was a tree I cut down myself . You wait till the morning and I ’ ll show you how they ’ re joined together at the corners . There ’ s some neat work there , my girl , I guess .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Here ’ s the kettle .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He pours water into it from the pail , and she puts the kettle on the stove .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>You ’ ll find some tea in one of them tins on the shelf . Leastways there was some there when I come away . I guess you ’ re hungry .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t think I am , very . I ate a very good supper in the train .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m glad you call that a good supper . I guess I could wrap up the amount you ate in a postal stamp .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>I haven ’ t a very large appetite .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I have . Where ’ s the loaf we got in Winnipeg this afternoon ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ll get it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>And the butter . You ’ ll bake to-morrow , I reckon .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>NORAH gets a loaf and a piece of butter out of the string bag she brought in with her . She puts them on the table .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Shall I cut you some ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Yep .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Please .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Please what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a smile .</stage>Yes , please .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Oh !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He gives her a look , and she , a quiet smile on her face , cuts two or three pieces of bread and butter . Then she gets tea out of the tin and puts it in a teapot .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I guess you ’ d better take your hat and coat off .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>NORAH does so without answering .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>You ain ’ t terribly talkative for a woman , my girl .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I haven ’ t got anything to say at the moment .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Well , I guess it ’ s better to have a wife as talks too little than a wife as talks too much .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>With her tongue in her cheek .</stage>I suppose absolute perfection is rare — in women , poor wretches .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>What ’ s that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I was only amusing myself with a reflection .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>TAYLOR takes off his coat and appears in a grey sweater . He sits down in the rocking chair .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I guess there ’ s no place like home . You get a bit fed up with hiring out . Ed was O. K ., I reckon , but it ain ’ t like being your own boss .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pointing .</stage>What ’ s through there ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Oh , that ’ s the bedroom . Like to have a look ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>When I built the shack I fixed it up so as it would do when I got married . Sid Sharp asked me what in hell I wanted to divide it up in half for , but I guess women like little luxuries like that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Like what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Like having a room to sleep in and a room to live in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Here ’ s the bread and butter . Will you have some syrup ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Sure .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He gets up and sits down at the table .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>That water ought to be boiling by now . What about milk ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s one of the things you ’ ll have to do without till I can afford to buy a cow .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I can ’ t drink tea without milk .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>You try . Say , can you milk a cow ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I ? No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Then it ’ s just as well I ain ’ t got one .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>You ’ re a philosopher .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She lifts the cover off the kettle and looks at it , then pours some water into the teapot , and sets it down on the table .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Is there a candle ? I ’ ll just get one or two things out of my box .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Ain ’ t you going to sit down and have a cup of tea ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t want any , thanks .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Sit down , my girl .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>Because I tell you to .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quite pleasantly .</stage>I don ’ t think you ’ d better tell me to do things .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Then I ask you . You ain ’ t going to refuse the first favour I ’ ve asked you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a pretty smile .</stage>Of course not .<stage>She sits down .</stage>There .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Now pour out my tea for me , will you ?<stage>He watches her do it .</stage>It is rum seeing my wife sitting down at my table and pouring out tea for me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Is it pleasant ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Sure . Now have some yourself , my girl . You ’ ll soon get used to drinking it without milk . And I guess you ’ ll be able to get some to-morrow from Mrs. Sharp .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>NORAH pours herself out some tea .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I had a sort of a feeling I wanted you and me to have the first meal together in your new home . Just take a bit of the bread and butter .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He passes over to her a slice and , smiling , she cuts a little piece off and eats it .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>We ain ’ t lost much time , I guess . Why , it ’ s only yesterday you told me not to call you Norah .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>That was very silly of me . I was in a temper .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>And now we ’ re man and wife .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Married in haste with a vengeance .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Ain ’ t you a bit scared ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I ? What of ? You ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>With Ed on t ’ other side of Winnipeg , he might just as well be in the Old Country for all the good he can be to you . You might be a bit scared to find yourself alone with a man you don ’ t know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m not nervous .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Good for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>You did give me a fright , though . When I asked you if you ’ d take me , I suppose it was only about fifteen seconds before you answered , but it seemed like ten minutes . I thought you might refuse .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I was thinking .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>No , I was thinking you wouldn ’ t have asked me like that if you hadn ’ t — despised me .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>NORAH , a little taken aback , gives him a quick look , but she tries to pass it off lightly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t know what makes you think that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Well , I don ’ t know how you could have put it more plainly that my name was mud .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Why didn ’ t you refuse , then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I guess I ’ m not a nervous fellow , either .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a twinkle in her eye .</stage>And women are scarce in Manitoba .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I always fancied an Englishwoman . They make the best wives when they ’ ve been licked into shape .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Frankly amused .</stage>Are you proposing to attempt that operation on me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>You ’ re clever . I guess a hint or two is about all you ’ ll want .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>It embarrasses me when you pay me compliments .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ll take you round and show you the land to-morrow . I ain ’ t done all the clearing yet , so there ’ ll be plenty of work for the winter . I want to have a hundred acres to sow next year . And then if I get a good crop I ’ ve a mind to take another quarter . You can ’ t make it pay really without you ’ ve got half a section . And it ’ s a tough proposition when you ain ’ t got capital .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I didn ’ t think I was marrying a millionaire .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Never mind , my girl , you shan ’ t live in a shack long , I promise you . It ’ s the greatest country in the world . We only want three good crops and you shall have a brick house same as you lived in at home .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I wonder what they ’ re doing in England now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Well , I guess they ’ re asleep .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>When I think of England I always think of it at tea-time .<stage>She looks at the tea-things they have just used .</stage>Miss Wickham had a beautiful old silver teapot — George II .— and she was awfully proud of it . And she was very proud of her tea-set — it was old Worcester — and she wouldn ’ t let anyone wash the things but .... And two or three times a week an old Indian judge came in to tea , and he used to talk to me about the East — oh , why did you make me think of it all ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>The past is dead and gone , my girl . We ’ ve got the future .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I wish we ’ d got a drop of liquor here so as we could drink one another ’ s health . But as we ain ’ t you ’ d better give me a kiss instead .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>It looks like it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Come , my girl , you didn ’ t even kiss me after we was married .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a perfectly friendly way .</stage>Isn ’ t a hint enough for you ? Why do you force me to say everything in so many words ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>It seems to me it wants a few words to make it plain when a woman refuses to give her husband a kiss .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Do sit down , there ’ s a good fellow , and I ’ ll tell you one or two things .</p>

     <p>You ’ ve taken the only one that ’ s tolerably comfortable . I think there ’ s nothing to choose between the others .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Nothing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I think we ’ d better fix things up before we go any further .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Sure .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>You gave me to understand very plainly that you wanted a wife in order to get a general servant without having to pay her wages . Wages are high in Canada .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>That was the way you put it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Baching isn ’ t very comfortable .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Not very .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>You wanted someone to cook and bake for you , wash , sweep , and mend . I offered to come and do all that . It never struck me for an instant that there was any possibility of your expecting anything else of me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Then you ’ re a damned fool , my girl .</p>

     <p><stage>Good-humouredly .</stage>I guess I shall have to say a good many things like that before we ’ ve done .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I asked you to marry me only because I couldn ’ t stay in the shack without .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I guess you asked me to marry you because you was in a hell of a temper . You wanted to get away from Ed ’ s farm right then , and you didn ’ t care what you did so long as you quit . But you was darned sorry for what you ’ d done by the time you ’ d packed your box .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Frigidly .</stage>What makes you think that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Why , when you come back in the kitchen you was as white as a sheet . You wanted to say you ’ d changed your mind , but your darned pride wouldn ’ t let you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I wouldn ’ t have stayed on in that house for anything in the world .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>And this morning , when I called for you at the Y. W. C. A ., you wanted to say you wouldn ’ t marry me . You tried to speak the words , but they wouldn ’ t come . When you shook hands with me your hand was like ice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I was nervous for a moment . After all , one isn ’ t married every day of one ’ s life , is one ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>If I hadn ’ t shown you the licence and the ring , I guess you wouldn ’ t have done it . You hadn ’ t the nerve to back out of it then .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I hadn ’ t slept a wink all night . I kept on turning it over in my mind . I was frightened at what I ’ d done . But I didn ’ t know a soul in Winnipeg . I hadn ’ t anywhere to go . I had four dollars in my pocket . I had to go through with it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>You took pretty good stock of me in the train on the way here , I guess .</p>

     <p>Well , I felt you was looking at me a good deal . It wasn ’ t hard to see that you was turning me over in your mind . What conclusion did you come to ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>You see , I lived all those years with an old lady . I know very little about men .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I guessed that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I came to the conclusion that you were a decent fellow . I thought you would be kind to me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Bouquets are just flying around . Have you got anything more to say to me ?</p>

     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Then just get me my pouch , will you ? I guess it ’ s in the pocket of my coat .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She hesitates a moment , looks at him , then gets it .</stage>

    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>You never paid much attention to me till to-day , I reckon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I was always polite to you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Very . But I was the hired man , and you never let me forget it . You thought yourself a darned sight better than me because you could play the piano and speak French . But we ain ’ t got a piano , and there ain ’ t anyone as speaks French nearer than Winnipeg .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>What are you driving at ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Parlour tricks ain ’ t much good on the prairie . They ’ re like dollar bills up in Hudson Bay . Tobacco ’ s the only thing you can trade with an Esquimaux . You can ’ t cook very well , you don ’ t know how to milk a cow — why , you can ’ t even harness a horse .</p>

     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>No , I guess I can teach you . But if I was you I wouldn ’ t put on any frills . We shall get along O. K ., I guess , when we ’ ve shaken down .</p>

     <p>It matters a great deal . Women are scarce in Manitoba .</p>

      <l>I don ’ t know what silly fancies you had in your head . When I married you</l>
      <l>I intended that you should be a proper wife to me .</l>

    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>But ... but ....<stage>She can hardly speak .</stage>But you understood .<stage>He does not answer . At last she collects herself . She tries to talk calmly and reasonably .</stage>I ’ m sorry for the way I behaved , Frank . It was childish of me to struggle with you . You irritated me by the way you spoke .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I don ’ t mind . I don ’ t know much about women and I guess they ’ re queer . We had to fix things up sometime and I guess there was no harm in getting it over right now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>You ’ ve beaten me all along the line and I ’ m in your power . Have mercy on me .</p>

     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I guess you won ’ t have much cause to complain .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I married you in a fit of temper . It was very stupid of me . I ’ m very sorry that I — that I ’ ve been all this trouble to you . Won ’ t you let me go ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>No , I can ’ t do that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m no good to you . You ’ ve told me that I ’ m useless . I can ’ t do any of the things that you want a wife to do . You can ’ t be so hard-hearted as to make me pay with all my life for one moment ’ s madness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>What good would it do if I let you go ? Will you go to Gertie and ask her to take you back again ? You ’ ve got too much pride for that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t think I ’ ve got much pride left .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t you think you ’ d better give it a try ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>All the life was so strange to me . In England they think it ’ s so different from what it really is . I thought I should have a horse to ride . I expected dances and tennis parties . And when I came out I was so out of it . I felt in the way . And yesterday they drove me frantic so that I felt I couldn ’ t stay another moment in that house . It was only an impulse . I made a mistake . I didn ’ t know what I was doing . You can ’ t have the heart to take advantage of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I knew you was making a mistake , but that was your look out . When I sell a man a horse he can look it over for himself , but I ain ’ t obliged to tell him its faults .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>D ’ you mean to say that after I ’ ve begged you almost on my knees to let me go you ’ ll force me to stay ?</p>

     <p>And you ’ re not in love with me .</p>

     <p>You ’ re a woman and I ’ m a man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>D ’ you want me to tell you in so many words that you ’ re physically repellent to me ? The thought of letting you kiss me horrifies and disgusts me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p><stage>Good-humouredly .</stage>Thank you .</p>

    <stage>TAYLOR changes his manner , which has been quite good-humoured , and speaks more sharply and with a certain stern force .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>See here , my girl — you was educated like a lady and spent your life doing nothing — a lady ’ s companion , wasn ’ t you — taking a little dawg out for a walk of a morning and combing out his pretty little coat ? And you look upon yourself as a darned sight better than me . I never had no schooling , and it ’ s a hell of a job for me to write a letter , but since I was so high I ’ ve earned my living . I guess I ’ ve been all over this country . I ’ ve been a trapper and I ’ ve worked on the railroad , and for two years I ’ ve been a freighter . I guess I ’ ve done pretty near everything but serve in a store . Now you just get busy and forget all the nonsense you ’ ve got in your head . You ’ re nothing but an ignorant woman and I ’ m your master . I ’ m going to do what I like with you , and if you don ’ t submit willingly , by God I ’ ll take you as the trappers in the old days used to take the squaws .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He steps towards her , and she , escaping from him , seizes his gun , which is lying against the wall . She lifts it and aims at him .</stage>

     <p>Unless you open the door and let me go I ’ ll shoot you . I ’ ll shoot you .</p>

     <p><stage>Aghast .</stage>It wasn ’ t loaded .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Of course it wasn ’ t loaded . D ’ you think I ’ d have stood there and told you to shoot if it had been ? I guess I ain ’ t thinking of committing suicide .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>And I almost admired you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>You hadn ’ t got no reason to . There ’ s nothing to admire about a man who stands five feet off a loaded gun that ’ s being aimed at him . He ’ s a darned fool , that ’ s all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>I guess you won ’ t .</p>

    <stage>He gives her a resounding kiss on the cheek and lets her go . Sinking into a chair , she puts her hands up to her flaming cheeks .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , how shameful , how shameful .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She sobs in helpless , angry despair . He puts his hand gently on her shoulder .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Hadn ’ t you better cave in , my girl ? You ’ ve tried your strength against mine and it didn ’ t amount to much . You tried to shoot me and I only made you look a darned fool . I guess you ’ re beat , my girl . There ’ s only one law here , and that ’ s the law of the strongest . You ’ ve got to do what I want because I can make you .</p>

Why , we might be the only two people in the world , you and me , here in this shack right out in the prairie . Listen . There ain ’ t a sound . It might be the garden of Eden . What ’ s that about male and female created He them ? I guess you ’ re my wife , my girl , and I want you .<stage>She gives him a sidelong look of terror , but still does not speak . He takes the lamp and goes to the bedroom door . He opens it and , holding the lamp up high , looks at her . Just to do something she takes the dishcloth and rubs the table with it . She wants to gain time .</stage>I guess it ’ s getting late . You ’ ll be able to have a good clean out to-morrow .</p>

     <p>To-morrow .<stage>A look of shame , fear , anguish , passes over her face , and then , violently , a convulsive shudder runs through her whole body . She puts her hands to her eyes and walks slowly to the door .</stage>END OF THE THIRD ACT</p>

     <stage>SCENE : The same as in the previous act , FRANK TAYLOR ’ S shack at Prentice , but there are signs about it of a woman ’ s presence . There is a cloth on the table , and a cushion on the rocking-chair , there are muslin curtains on the window tied back with ribband , and there are geraniums growing in maple-syrup tins . There is a rough bookshelf against the wall , on which is NORAH ’ S small stock of books . Coloured supplements from the Christmas numbers of illustrated papers are pinned neatly on the walls . The packing-cases which had been used as stools have been replaced by rough chairs which TAYLOR has made with his own hands during the winter . When the door of the shack is opened the blue sky is seen and the prairie . NORAH is arranging mustard flowers in a pudding basin on the table . She wears a serge skirt and a neat shirt-waist : she has a healthier look than before , her face is tanned and she has a higher colour . She hears a sound and looks up . TAYLOR enters .</stage>

     <p>Well , I guess I thought if you still wanted to quit , Ed ’ s coming would be kind of useful .</p>

     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Why d ’ you think I want to ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>You ain ’ t been very talkative these months , but I guess it wasn ’ t hard to see you ’ d have given pretty near anything in the world to quit .</p>

     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m not going back to Eddie ’ s farm , if that ’ s what you mean .</p>

     <p>If he comes before I get back , tell him I won ’ t be long . I guess you won ’ t be sorry to do a bit of yarning with him by yourself .</p>

    <stage>He goes out . NORAH looks at him with a puzzled air , then she gives a touch to the flowers , and gets her work . She sits down at the table and begins to mend a thick woollen sock . Suddenly there is a loud knock at the door . She starts up and runs to open it . EDWARD MARSH is seen standing outside . She gives a cry of delight and flings her arms round his neck . He comes in .</stage>

     <p>Didn ’ t you see Frank ? He ’ s only just this moment gone out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>He ’ ll be in presently . Now , come in . Oh , my dear , it is splendid to see you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>You ’ re looking fine , Norah .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Have you had dinner ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Sure . We got something to eat before we left Prentice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Well , I ’ ll make you a cup of tea .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>No , I won ’ t have anything , thanks .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>You ’ re not a real Canadian yet if you refuse a cup of tea when it ’ s offered you . Well , sit down and make yourself comfortable .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>How are you getting on , Norah ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , never mind about me . Tell me about yourself . How ’ s Gertie ? And what brought you to this part of the world ? And what ’ s Reggie Hornby doing ? And is thingamygig still with you ? You know , the hired man . What was his name ? Trotter , wasn ’ t it ? Oh , my dear , don ’ t sit there like a stuffed pig , but speak to me , or I shall shake you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>My dear , I can ’ t answer fifteen questions all at once .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Eddie , I ’ m so glad to see you . You are a duck to come and see me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Let me get a word in edgeways .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I won ’ t say another syllable . But for goodness ’ sake , hurry up . I want to know all sorts of things .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Well , the first thing is that I ’ m expecting to be a happy father in three or four months .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Eddie , I ’ m so glad . How happy Gertie must be !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>She doesn ’ t know what to make of it . But I guess she ’ s pleased right enough . She sends you her love and says she hopes you ’ ll follow her example soon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I ? But you ’ ve not told me what you ’ re doing in this part of the world , anyway .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>Anyway ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a laugh .</stage>I ’ ve practically spoken to no one but Frank for months . I get into his ways of speaking .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Well , when I got Frank ’ s letter about the clearing machine ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Interrupting him .</stage>Has Frank written to you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Why , yes . Didn ’ t you know ? He said there was a clearing machine going cheap at Prentice . I ’ ve always thought I could make money down our way if I had one . They say you can clear from three to four acres a day with it . Frank said it was worth my while coming to have a look at it , and he guessed you ’ d be glad to see me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>How funny of him not to say anything to me about it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>I expect he wanted to surprise you . Now , how d ’ you like being a married woman ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , all right . Why has Reggie Hornby come with you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>D ’ you know , I ’ ve not seen you since you were married .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>You haven ’ t , have you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve been a bit anxious about you . That ’ s why , when Frank wrote about the clearing machine , I didn ’ t stop to think about it , but just came .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>It was very nice of you . But why has Reggie Hornby come ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , he ’ s going back to England .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Is he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Yes , he got them to send him his passage at last . His ship doesn ’ t sail till next week , and he said he might just as well stop off here and say good-bye to you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>How has he been getting on ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>What do you expect ? He looks upon work as something that only damned fools do . Where ’ s Frank ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , he ’ s out with Sid Sharp . That ’ s our neighbour . He has the farm you passed on your way here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Getting on all right with him , Norah ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Of course . What ’ s that boy doing all this time ? He is slow , isn ’ t he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s a great change for you , this , after the sort of life you ’ ve been used to .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>To change the topic .</stage>I was rather hoping you ’ d have some letters for me . I haven ’ t had any for a long time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>There now , I ’ ve got a head like a sieve . Two came by the last mail and I didn ’ t send them on because I was coming myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>You haven ’ t forgotten them ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>No , here they are .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Reading the addresses .</stage>
      <l>They don ’ t look very exciting . One ’ s from</l>
      <l>Agnes Pringle . She was a lady ’ s companion that I used to know in</l>
      <l>Tunbridge Wells . And the other ’ s from Mr. Wynne .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Who ’ s he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , he was Miss Wickham ’ s solicitor . He wrote to me once before to say he hoped I was getting on all right .<stage>Putting the letters on the table .</stage>I don ’ t think I want to hear from people in England any more .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>My dear , why d ’ you say that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s no good thinking of the past , is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Aren ’ t you going to read your letters ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Not now . I ’ ll read them when I ’ m alone .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t mind me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s so silly of me , but letters from England always make me cry .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking at her sharply .</stage>Norah , aren ’ t you happy here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Yes , why shouldn ’ t I be ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Why haven ’ t you written to me once since you were married ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I hadn ’ t got much to say .<stage>With a smile .</stage>And after all , I ’ d been practically turned out of your house .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Puzzled .</stage>I don ’ t know what to make of you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Nervous and almost exasperated .</stage>Oh , don ’ t cross-examine me , there ’ s a dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Frank Taylor ’ s kind to you and all that sort of thing , isn ’ t he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Quite .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>When I asked you to come and stay on the farm I thought it wouldn ’ t be long before you married , but I didn ’ t expect you ’ d marry one of the hired men .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , my dear , don ’ t worry about me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s all very fine to say that . You ’ ve got no one in the world belonging to you but me , and when — when our mother died , she said : “ You ’ ll take care of Norah , won ’ t you , Eddie ?”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a sob in her voice .</stage>Oh , don ’ t , don ’ t .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Norah .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>With an effort at self-possession .</stage>We ’ ve never quarrelled since the first day I came here . Here ’ s Reggie .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She turns to him with relief . HORNBY is dressed in a blue serge suit and again looks like a well-groomed English gentleman .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gaily .</stage>I was wondering what on earth you were doing with yourself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Shaking hands with her .</stage>I say , this is a very swell shack you ’ ve got .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve tried to make it look pretty and homelike .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MARSH catches sight of the bowl of mustard flowers .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Hulloa , what ’ s this ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Aren ’ t they pretty ? I ’ ve only just picked them . Mustard flowers .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>We call it weed . Have you got much of it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Oh yes , lots . Why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , nothing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>To HORNBY .</stage>I hear you ’ re going home .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I ’ m fed up with God ’ s own country . Nature never intended me to be an agricultural labourer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>What are you going to do now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p><stage>With immense conviction .</stage>Loaf !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Amused .</stage>Won ’ t you get bored ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m never bored . It amuses me to look at other people do things . I should hate my fellow creatures to be idle .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a faint smile .</stage>I should have thought one could do more with life than lounge about clubs and play cards with people who don ’ t play as well as oneself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>I quite agree with you . I ’ ve been thinking things over very seriously this winter . And I ’ m going to look out for a middle-aged widow with money who ’ ll adopt me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I remember that you have decided views about the White Man ’ s Burden .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>All I want is to get through life comfortably . I don ’ t mean to do a stroke more work than I ’ m obliged to , and I ’ m going to have the very best time I can get .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>I ’ m sure you will .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>The moment I get back to London I ’ m going to stand myself a slap-up dinner at the Ritz , then I shall go and see a musical comedy at the Gaiety , and after that I ’ ll have a slap-up supper at Romano ’ s . England , with all thy faults , I love thee well .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I suppose it ’ s being alone with the prairie all these months , things which used to seem rather funny and clever — well , I see them quite differently now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coolly .</stage>I ’ m afraid you don ’ t altogether approve of me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Not disagreeably .</stage>You haven ’ t got pluck .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t know about that . I expect I have as much as anyone else , only I don ’ t make a fuss about it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , pluck to stand up and let yourself be shot at — I daresay . But pluck to do the same monotonous thing day after day , plain , honest , hard work — you haven ’ t got that . You ’ re a failure , and the worst of it is , you ’ re not ashamed of it . It fills you with self-satisfaction .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>Rule Britannia , and what price the Union Jack ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a laugh .</stage>You ’ re incorrigible .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>I am .... I suppose there ’ s nothing you want me to take home . I shall be going down to Tunbridge Wells to see mother . Got any messages ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t know that I have . Eddie has just brought me a couple of letters . I ’ ll have a look at them .<stage>She opens Miss Pringle ’ s letter , reads two or three lines , and gives a cry .</stage>Oh !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>What ’ s the matter ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>What does she mean ?<stage>Reading .</stage>“ I ’ ve just heard from Mr. Wynne about your good luck , and I have another piece of good news for you .”<stage>She puts the letter down and quickly opens the solicitor ’ s . She takes out of the envelope a letter and a cheque . She glances at it .</stage>A cheque — for five hundred pounds .... Oh , Eddie , listen .<stage>Reading .</stage>“ Dear Miss Marsh ,— I have had several interviews with Mr. Wickham in relation to the late Miss Wickham ’ s estate , and I ventured to represent to him that you had been very badly treated . Now that everything is settled he wishes to send you the enclosed cheque as some recognition of your devoted service to his late aunt ....” Five hundred pounds !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s a very respectable sum .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>I could do with that myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve never had so much money in all my life .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>But what ’ s the other piece of good news that Miss Stick-in-the-mud talks about ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I forgot .<stage>She takes Miss Pringle ’ s letter up again and begins to read it .</stage>“... Piece of good news for you . I write at once so that you may make your plans accordingly . I told you in my last letter of my sister-in-law ’ s sudden death , and now my brother is very anxious that I should live with him . So I am leaving Mrs. Hubbard , and she wishes me to say that if you care to have my place as her companion she will be very pleased to have you . I have been with her for thirteen years , and she has always treated me like an equal . She is very considerate , and there is practically nothing to do but to exercise the dogs . The salary is thirty-five pounds a year .”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Both letters are addressed to Miss Marsh . Don ’ t they know you ’ re married ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>No . I never told them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>What a lark ! You could go back to Tunbridge Wells , and none of the old frumps would ever know you ’ d been married .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>NORAH gives a sudden start when he says this and stares at him with wide-open eyes . There is a moment ’ s pause .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Just clear out for a minute , Reg . I want to speak to Norah .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>Right-o .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Norah , d ’ you want to clear out ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>What on earth makes you think that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>You gave him such a look when he mentioned it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m bewildered . Did Frank know anything about this ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>My dear , how could he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s so extraordinary . He was talking about my going away just now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quickly .</stage>Why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Oh !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She realises that she has betrayed the secret inadvertently .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Norah , for goodness ’ sake tell me if there ’ s anything the matter . After all , it ’ s now or never . You ’ re keeping back something from me . Aren ’ t you getting on well together ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a low voice .</stage>Not very .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Why didn ’ t you let me know ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I was ashamed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>But you say he ’ s kind to you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve got nothing to reproach him with .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I felt that something was wrong . I knew you couldn ’ t be happy with him .</l>
      <l>A girl like you and a hired man . The whole thing was horrible . Thank God</l>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>You ’ re not fit for this life . You ’ ve got a chance to go back to England . For God ’ s sake take it . In six months all you ’ ve gone through here will seem nothing but a hideous dream .<stage>He is suddenly struck by the expression of her face .</stage>Norah , what ’ s the matter ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Tragically .</stage>I don ’ t know .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>HORNBY comes in again .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HORNBY</speaker>
     <p>I say , here ’ s someone coming to see you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Me ?<stage>She goes to the door and looks out .</stage>Oh , it ’ s Mrs. Sharp . Whatever brings her here on foot ? She never walks a step if she can help it . She ’ s the wife of my neighbour .... Good-afternoon , Mrs. Sharp .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MRS. SHARP enters . She is a middle-aged woman , red in the face , stout and rather short of breath . She wears an old sun-bonnet , a faded shirt-waist , none too clean , and a rather battered skirt .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Come right in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. SHARP</speaker>
     <p>Good-afternoon to you , Mrs. Taylor . I ’ m all in a perspiration . I ’ ve not walked so far in months .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>This is my brother .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. SHARP</speaker>
     <p>Your brother ? Is that who it is ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>It seems to surprise you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. SHARP</speaker>
     <p>I was so anxious , I couldn ’ t stay indoors . I went out to see if I could catch sight of Sid , and I walked on and then I saw the rig what ’ s outside , and it give me such a turn , I thought it was the inspector . I just had to come . I was that nervous .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Is anything the matter ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. SHARP</speaker>
     <p>You ’ re not going to tell me you don ’ t know about it ? Why , Sid and Frank haven ’ t been talking about anything else since Frank found it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Found what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. SHARP</speaker>
     <p>The weed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a slight gesture towards the pudding bowl of flowers .</stage>You have got it , then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. SHARP</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s worse at Taylor ’ s . But we ’ ve got it too .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>What does it mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. SHARP</speaker>
     <p>We can ’ t make out who reported us . It isn ’ t as if we had any enemies .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , there ’ s always someone to report you . No one ’ s going to take the risk of letting it get on his own land .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. SHARP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking at the mustard blossom .</stage>And she has them in the house as if they were flowers .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Tell me what she means , Eddie .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>My dear , these pretty little flowers which you ’ ve picked to make your shack look bright and homelike — they may mean ruin .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Eddie !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>You must have heard us talk about the weed . We farmers have three enemies to fight — frost , hail , and weed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. SHARP</speaker>
     <p>We was hailed out last year . Lost our crop . We never got a dollar for it . And if we lose it this year too — why , we may just as well quit .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>When it gets into your crop you ’ ve got to report it , and if you don ’ t one of the neighbours will . And then they send an inspector along , and if he condemns it , why you just have to destroy the crop , and all your year ’ s work is lost . You ’ re lucky if you ’ ve got a bit of money in the bank and can go on till the next crop comes along .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. SHARP</speaker>
     <p>We ’ ve only got a quarter section and five children . It ’ s not much money you can save then .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>Are they out with the inspector now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. SHARP</speaker>
     <p>Yes . He came out from Prentice this morning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>This is a bad job for Frank .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. SHARP</speaker>
     <p>Oh , he hasn ’ t got the mouths to feed that we have . He can hire out again . But what ’ s to become of us ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I wonder why he never told me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. SHARP</speaker>
     <p>I guess he ’ s in the habit of keeping his troubles to himself and you ’ ve not taught him different yet .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>NORAH gives her a quick look , but seeing the woman is all on edge with nervousness does not answer .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>You must hope for the best , Mrs. Sharp .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. SHARP</speaker>
     <p>Sid says we ’ ve only got it in one place , but perhaps he ’ s only saying it so I shouldn ’ t worry . You know what them inspectors are . They don ’ t lose nothing by it . It don ’ t matter to them if you starve all the winter .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She gives a sob and heavy tears roll down her cheeks .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Oh don ’ t — don ’ t cry , Mrs. Sharp . After all , it may be all right .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>They won ’ t condemn the crop unless it ’ s very bad . Too many people have got their eyes on it . The machine agent , the loan company .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. SHARP</speaker>
     <p>What with the hail that comes and hails you out and the frost that kills your crop just when you ’ re beginning to count on it , and the weed — I can ’ t bear it any more . If we lose this crop I won ’ t go on . I ’ ll make Sid sell out and we ’ ll go home . We ’ ll take a little shop somewhere . That ’ s what I wanted to do from the beginning , but Sid — he had his heart set on farming .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>You couldn ’ t go back now . You ’ d never be happy in a little shop . And if you ’ d stayed in England you ’ d have been always at the beck and call of somebody else . And you own the land . You couldn ’ t do that in England . When you come out of your door and look at the growing wheat , aren ’ t you proud to think it ’ s yours ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. SHARP</speaker>
     <p>You don ’ t know what I ’ ve had to put up with . When the children came , only once I had a doctor . The other times Sid was the only help I had . I might have been an animal . I wish I ’ d never come to this country .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>How can you say that ! Your children are strong and healthy . Why , they ’ ll be able to help you in the work soon . You ’ ve given them a chance that they ’ d never have got at home .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. SHARP</speaker>
     <p>Oh , it ’ s all very well for them . They ’ ll have it easy . I know that . But we ’ ve had to pay for it , Sid and me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>You see , you were the first . It ’ s bitter work opening up a new country and perhaps it ’ s others who reap the harvest . But I wonder if those who start don ’ t get a reward that the later comers never dream of .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>She ’ s right there , Mrs. Sharp . I shall never forget what I felt when I saw my first crop spring up and thought that never since the world began had wheat grown on that little bit of ground .... I wouldn ’ t go back to England now for anything in the world . I couldn ’ t breathe .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. SHARP</speaker>
     <p>You ’ re a man . You have the best of it and all the credit .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>People don ’ t know . You mustn ’ t blame them . It ’ s only those who ’ ve lived out on the prairie who know that the hardships of opening up a new country fall on the women . But the men who are their husbands , they know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARSH</speaker>
     <p>I guess they do , Mrs. Sharp .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>NORAH , on her knees beside her , strokes MRS. SHARP ’ S hands . MRS. SHARP gives her a grateful smile .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. SHARP</speaker>
     <p>Thank you for speaking kindly to me , my dear . I ’ m that nervous , I hardly know what I ’ m saying .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Sid and Frank will be here in a minute , surely .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. SHARP</speaker>
     <p>And you ’ re right , my dear , I couldn ’ t go back any more . If we lose our crop , well , we must wait till next year . We shan ’ t starve . One ’ s got to take the rough with the smooth , and take it all in all , it ’ s a good country .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>FRANK TAYLOR comes in .</stage>

    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Sure . Only a few acres has got to go . That won ’ t hurt you .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>MRS. SHARP</speaker>
     <p>Thank God for that . And it ’ s going to be the best crop we ever had . It ’ s the finest country in the world .</p>

     <p>You ’ d better be getting back . Sid ’ s taken the inspector up to give him some dinner .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>If I saved the crop there didn ’ t seem any use fussing , and if I didn ’ t you ’ d know quite soon enough .</p>

     <p>How could you bear to let me put the flowers here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I guess I didn ’ t mind if it made you happy . You didn ’ t know they was only a weed . You thought them darned pretty .</p>

     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Why didn ’ t you tell me you ’ d written to Eddie ?</p>

     <p>What makes you think that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>I guess you only stayed here because you had to .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She goes over to the little window and looks out at the prairie .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Is life always like that ? The things you ’ ve wanted so dreadfully seem only to bring you pain when they come .<stage>He gives her a quick look , but does not answer , and she notices nothing .</stage>Month after month I used to sit looking at the prairie and sometimes I wanted to scream at the top of my voice just to break the silence . I thought I should never escape . The shack was like a prison . I was hemmed in by the snow and the cold and the stillness .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I guess we ain ’ t made a great success of married life , my girl .... It ’ s rum when you come to figure it out . I thought I could make you do everything I wanted . It looked as if I held a straight flush . And you beat me .</p>

     <p>I guess I didn ’ t know how strong a woman could be . You was always givin ’ way , you done everything I told you — and all the time you was keepin ’ something from me that I couldn ’ t get at .

    <stage>She looks at him with consternation . His words give her a queer little twist of the heart-strings .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I know you now less than when you ’ d only been a week up at Ed ’ s . I ’ ve lost the trail and I ’ m just floundering around in the bush .</p>

     <p>I suppose parting ’ s always rather painful .</p>

     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rather shyly .</stage>Perhaps you ’ ll come over to England one of these days . If you have a couple of good years you could easily shut the place up and run over for the winter .</p>

     <p>I was an ignorant , uneducated man . I didn ’ t know how to treat you properly . I wanted to make you happy and I didn ’ t seem to know just how to do it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>You ’ ve never been unkind to me , Frank . You ’ ve been very patient with me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I guess you ’ ll be happier away from me . I ’ ll be able to think that you ’ re warm and comfortable at home and you ’ ve got plenty to eat .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>D ’ you think that ’ s all I want ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He gives her a rapid glance , and then setting his teeth looks away .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I couldn ’ t expect you to stay on here , not when you got a chance of going back to the Old Country . This life is all new to you . And you know that one .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , yes , I know it — I should think I did .<stage>As she pictures to herself the daily round which awaits her , she is filled with a sort of mirthless scorn , and this presently , as she speaks , is mixed with hatred and dismay .</stage>At eight o ’ clock every morning a maid will bring me tea and hot water . And I shall get up , and I shall have breakfast , and I shall interview the cook . I shall order luncheon and dinner . And I shall brush the coats of Mrs. Hubbard ’ s poms and take them for a walk on the common . All the paths on the common are asphalted so that elderly gentlemen and lady ’ s companions shouldn ’ t get their feet wet .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Gee !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>And then I shall come in and lunch , and after luncheon I shall go for a drive , one day in this direction and one day in that . And then I shall have tea , and then I shall go out again on the nice neat asphalt paths to give the dogs another walk . And then I shall change my dress and come down to dinner . And after dinner I shall play bezique with my employer , and I must take care not to beat her because she doesn ’ t like being beaten . And at ten o ’ clock I shall go to bed ....<stage>She pauses a moment .</stage>At eight o ’ clock next morning a maid will bring in my tea and hot water , and the day will begin again . Every day will be just like every other . And there are hundreds of women in England , strong and capable , with blood in their veins , who would be eager to get the place that ’ s offered to me . Almost a lady and thirty-five pounds a year .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>TAYLOR has been gazing at her steadily . What she means begins to dawn on him , but he restrains himself . He will not look at her now .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I guess it ’ s a bit different from the life you ’ ve had here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Turning to him .</stage>And you will be clearing the scrub , cutting down trees , ploughing the land , sowing and reaping . You will be fighting every day , frost , hail , and weed ; you will be fighting , but I know you ’ ll be conquering in the end . Where was wilderness will be cultivated land . And who knows what starving child may eat the bread that has been made from the wheat that you grew . My life will be ineffectual and useless , but you will have done something worth while .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Why , what ’ s the matter with you , Norah , Norah ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He does not say the words to her , but rather to himself as though they were forced from him in agony of spirit .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>When I was talking to Mrs. Sharp just now I don ’ t know what I said , I was just trying to comfort her because she was crying , and it seemed to be someone else who was speaking , and I listened to myself . I thought I hated the prairie through the long winter months , and yet somehow it has caught hold of me . It was dreary and monotonous , and yet I can ’ t get it out of my heart . There ’ s a beauty and a romance in it which fill my soul with longing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quietly .</stage>I guess we all hate the prairie sometimes , but when you ’ ve once lived in it , it ain ’ t easy to live anywhere else .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>I know the life now . It ’ s not adventurous and exciting . For men and women it ’ s the same hard work from morning till night , and I know it ’ s the women who bear the greater burden . The men go into the towns , they have shooting now and then , and the different seasons bring them different work . But for the women it ’ s always the same , cooking , mending , washing , sweeping . And yet it ’ s all got a meaning . We , too , have our part in opening up the country . We are its mothers and the future is in us . We are building up the greatness of the nation . It needs our courage and strength and hope , and because it needs them , they come to us . Oh , Frank , I can ’ t go back to that petty , narrow life . What have you done to me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hoarsely .</stage>I guess if I asked you to stay now , you ’ d stay .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a low voice .</stage>You said you wanted my love . Don ’ t you know ?... Love has been growing in me slowly , month by month , and I wouldn ’ t see it . I told myself I hated you . I was ashamed . It ’ s only to-day , when I had the means of leaving you for ever , that I knew I couldn ’ t live without you . I ’ m not ashamed any more . I love you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I guess I loved you from the beginning , Norah .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Why d ’ you say it as if ...? What ’ s the matter , Frank ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I guess you ’ ll have to take that job in England . I can ’ t ask you to stay on .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>The inspector ’ s condemned the crop . I ’ m bust .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , why didn ’ t you tell me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I guess I couldn ’ t . I made up my mind when I married you that I ’ d make good . I couldn ’ t expect you to see that it was just bad luck . Anyone can get the weed in his crop . But I guess a man oughtn ’ t to have bad luck . The odds are that it ’ s his own fault if he has .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Now I understand about Eddie .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I wrote to him when I knew I ’ d been reported .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>What are you going to do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s all right for me . I can hire out . It ’ s you I was thinking of . I felt pretty sure you wouldn ’ t go back to Ed ’ s . I didn ’ t fancy you taking a position as lady help . I didn ’ t know what was to become of you , my girl . And when you told me of the job in England , I thought I ’ d let you go .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Without telling me you were in trouble ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Why , if I wasn ’ t smashed up , d ’ you think I ’ d let you go ? By God , I wouldn ’ t . I ’ d have kep ’ you — by God , I ’ d have kep ’ you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Are you going to give the land up ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>No , I guess I can ’ t do that . I ’ ve put too much work in it . And I ’ ve got my back up now . I shall hire out for the summer and next winter I can get work lumbering . The land ’ s my own now , and I ’ ll come back in time for the ploughing next year .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Look .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>What ’ s that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She hands him the cheque which she has received from Mr. Wynne .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>The nephew of the lady I was with has made me a present of it . Twenty-five hundred dollars . You can lake the quarter section next to this one and get all the machinery you want and some cows . It ’ s yours to do what you like with . Now will you keep me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Oh , my girl , how shall I ever be able to thank you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Good heavens , I don ’ t want thanks . There ’ s nothing in the world so wonderful as to be able to give to someone you love .... Give me a kiss and try .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>I guess it ’ s the first time you ’ ve asked me to do that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NORAH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I ’ m so happy .</p>
