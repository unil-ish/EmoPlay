     <role>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>“ The Tyranny of Tears</role>
     <roleDesc>" a comedy of the emotions , is most ingeniously</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>constructed on the simplest lines ; it is a triumph of the commonplace</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Played virtually by five characters</role>
     <roleDesc>and with but one change of scene</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>it has that specious appearance of ease which is due to dexterity of</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>craftsmanship . It is refreshing</role>
     <roleDesc>free from theatrical expedients , and</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>save perhaps for the somewhat accelerated wooing in Act Four</role>
     <roleDesc>knots</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>which we are accustomed to see snipped by the scissors of an erratic</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>fate are here gently untangled by the fingers of probability . The germ</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>of it</role>
     <roleDesc>a matter of fortunate selection , is a human foible so universal</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>that if a man is not conscious of it in his own proper person</role>
     <roleDesc>he has</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>not failed to smile over it among his neighbors : that combination of</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>fondness and egoism out of which tyranny is legitimately born . This is</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>the keynote ; it announces itself speedily upon the raising of the</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>curtain</role>
     <roleDesc>and it is never for a moment after obscured by those modern</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>subtilties calculated to provoke discussion among the elect . The</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>hearer equipped with ordinary experience finds himself listening to it</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>with an acquiescent stream of running comment . He knows this alphabet</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>It spells familiar words</role>
     <roleDesc>and they come frequently . Here are</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>commonplaces which he has failed perhaps to formulate ; but now they</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>flash upon the inward eye with a convincing vividness . This</role>
     <roleDesc>he sees</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>at once</role>
     <roleDesc>is a picture of pink and white tyranny , the triumph of the</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>weak . Domestic life has been caught and fixed at the culmination of a</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>strain : one of those dramatic moments when the cord snaps because it</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>has been for a long time fraying . One party to the contract has drawn</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>up a code and imposed it upon his mate . The tyrant has some piquancy ;</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>she disarms suspicion because</role>
     <roleDesc>although a despot , she is masquerading</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>as something else . Another sort of bully we know : the buckram female</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>loud-voiced , militant , announcing herself , like the mosquito , by a</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>vicious trumpeting . Invulnerability sits on her helm ; her armor clanks</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>a little while she strides . But this new tyrant wears another mien</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Behold her ! a soft-cheeked</role>
     <roleDesc>gentle-handed ministrant , who would have</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>husbands happy</role>
     <roleDesc>provided they show the chivalrous courtesy of becoming</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>so in woman 's way . She knows the rules of the game according as her</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>sex interprets them</role>
     <roleDesc>and it never enters her ingenuous mind that “ in</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>marriage there are two ideals to be realized . ” Thus does she make her</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>gentle progress</role>
     <roleDesc>the victim beside her crowned with garlands , but yet</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>a victim . She is the arch destroyer</role>
     <roleDesc>the juggernaut in muslin</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>As soon , therefore , as she is recognized , there is a great pricking-up</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>of ears all over the house . Few are they whose withers are unwrung</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Every man among them</role>
     <roleDesc>primed with his own warfare or that of some</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>defeated chum</role>
     <roleDesc>settles down to the play , and wives follow suit with a</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>guilty sense that such things are</role>
     <roleDesc>though “ not , thank heaven ! under</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>roof of mine . ”</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>A sly humor runs through the piece like a warm-colored thread</role>
     <roleDesc>a humor</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>always faithful to those universal traits that make us kin . It asserts</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>itself robustly from time to time , once , for a notable instance , in</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>the fact that Parbury is moderately well content in his fool 's</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>paradise until Gunning appears to beckon him out of it . Heretofore he</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>has accepted his experience like a chronic indigestion or a lameness</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>to which he was born ; but now comes another man like unto himself</role>
     <roleDesc>and</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>welds the data of his martyrdom into a cannonball . This man</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>generalizes</role>
     <roleDesc>and Parbury at once perceives that husbands are not the</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>victims of special visitation</role>
     <roleDesc>but of an epidemic . The thing is</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>universal . It can be classified ; it can even be attacked . He stands</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>shoulder to shoulder with his suffering brothers</role>
     <roleDesc>and makes his stroke</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>for liberty</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>This is everyday life and the dialogue expresses it ; the lines are</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>neither too bright nor good for any drawing-room . Here are no</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>sky-rocketings to make the hearer gasp at the playwright 's cleverness</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>while at the same time they accentuate the difference between his own</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>world and the world as it glitters from the stage . It is the talk to</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>be expected out of the mouths of admirable yet matter-of-fact persons</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>with whom we are quite at home . This is the man you meet at any</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>corner</role>
     <roleDesc>who is living his life as he conceives it , and is vaguely</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>discomfited when the pattern comes out wrong . He and his fellow</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>puppets are related in the most intimate and delightful way to our own</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>cousins and aunts . It is a group of sharply differentiated types :</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Parbury</role>
     <roleDesc>honey-combed with something that passes for amiability ; his</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>charming ruler ; worldly-wise Gunning</role>
     <roleDesc>fitted like a glove with amiable</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>cynicisms ; the Colonel</role>
     <roleDesc>clad in rejuvenescence like the spring ; and</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Miss Woodward</role>
     <roleDesc>an original piquing to the intelligence of any actress</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>ambitious to “ create a part . ”</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>“ The Tyranny of Tears ” was first produced at the Criterion Theatre in</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>London , April 6 , 1899 , with the following</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>CAST OF CHARACTERS :</role>

     <role>MR. PARBURY . . . . . . . . MR. CHARLES WYNDHAM</role>

    <castItem>
     <role>MISS HYACINTH WOODWARD . . . MISS MAUDE MILLETT</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>The comedy made an instant and striking success</role>
     <roleDesc>and ran to enormous</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>business until the end of the season . It was revived on January 29</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>1902 , when the press , previously unstinting in its praise , greeted it</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>with a renewed enthusiasm . The Times says of it</role>
     <roleDesc>at this second</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>hearing : “ No English dramatist of our time has turned out more</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>humorous or more human work than this delightful comedy . Every feeling</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>in it is , as the French say , ‘ lived , ’ and every word of it tells</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>There is not a false note</role>
     <roleDesc>no over-strained sentiment , no</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>over-emphasized phrase in it from one end to the other . Wit it has in</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>abundance , but not in superabundance — wit , that is , that obviously</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>belongs to the speaker and does not delusively suggest the author</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Truth , too , it has , but always simple , straightforward , fundamental</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>truth</role>
     <roleDesc>truth that comes home to men 's business and bosoms , not the</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>far-fetched truth which costs a headache to master it . . . . The</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Comic Spirit</role>
     <roleDesc>as expounded by Mr. George Meredith , inhabits it . We</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>laugh at its personages and forgive them with an intimate solace</role>
     <roleDesc>for</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>in forgiving them we laughingly forgive ourselves . . . . The whole</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>tone of the play is quiet , it soothes , it provokes smiles , chuckles</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>gentle ripples of laughter . It is a rebuke</role>
     <roleDesc>a kindly , playful rebuke</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>to the wild and whirling zealots of theatrical violence . We are</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>reminded of the praise which Matthew Arnold bestowed upon the style of</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Addison — ‘ perfect , ’ he said , ‘ in measure , balance and propriety . ’ ”</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Equally warm tributes to the comedy as an unusual work of dramatic art</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>were accorded on its presentation , September 11 , 1899 , at the Empire</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Theatre</role>
     <roleDesc>New York , with the following</roleDesc>

     <roleDesc>in the New York Evening</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Post</role>
     <roleDesc>says : “ Mr. Drew played Parbury with his accustomed neatness and</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>dexterity . . . . The play</role>
     <roleDesc>perhaps , may not be quite highly seasoned</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>enough with dramatic incident for the great mass of the public</role>
     <roleDesc>but</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>its ingenuity</role>
     <roleDesc>its simplicity , its truthfulness and its humor will</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>commend it strongly to connoisseurs . ”</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>It was afterwards given in the principal cities of the United States</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>with Mr. Drew as the victimized husband</role>
     <roleDesc>and met everywhere with the</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>same enthusiastic favor . This year</role>
     <roleDesc>1902 , the play was done into</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>German by Bertha Pozson</role>
     <roleDesc>and it has been given with extraordinary</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>success throughout the German Empire</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Mr . Chambers 's earlier work lay more in the direction of strong dramas</role>

     <role>such as “ Captain Swift , ” “ The Idler , ” and “ John a ’ Dreams , ” but the</role>

     <stage>SCENE .— MR . CLEMENT PARBURY 'S study at his house in the neighbourhood of Hampstead Heath . The main entrance leading from the hall is C. A door , R ., leads to the dining-room . A glass door , R. C ., opens into a garden . The fireplace is C. The room is comfortably and not severely furnished . The furniture is made up of “ odds and ends ” selected with taste . The couch down L. is a deep and cosy one ; the desk or writing-table about R. C . is a large and serviceable one . There is a smaller desk higher up , and near it on wall , R ., a telephone apparatus . The apartment altogether represents the workshop of a literary man of careless good taste . There is a touch , too , of femininity in its decorations , and a portrait of MRS. PARBURY is the only picture on the walls , which otherwise are mostly hidden by bookcases .</stage>
    </stage>
    <stage>For a few moments before and when the curtain rises the noise of street singers is heard . MISS WOODWARD and EVANS are discovered . MISS WOODWARD is dressed with severe simplicity in a costume of dark colour , with linen collar and cuffs ; her dark hair is drawn back from her forehead . Her costume , being well cut , does not conceal the graceful outline of her figure . She is a handsome , innocent , yet determined-looking girl of twenty . She is at the window looking out .</stage>

     <speaker>EVANS</speaker>
     <p><stage>Raising his voice above the outside singers .</stage>They would n't listen to me , Miss Woodward !<stage>Suddenly the music stops . A pause .</stage>Ah , they 've listened to Mr. Parbury !<stage>MISS WOODWARD goes to desk , R ., sits .</stage>Mr. Parbury 's a very masterful man — outside his house — is n't he , Miss ?<stage>MISS WOODWARD favours EVANS with a cold stare , then resumes work at desk .</stage><stage>Aside .</stage>What an iceberg that young woman is !<stage>Telephone bell rings .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Exit EVANS , L .</stage>
    <stage>MISS WOODWARD goes to telephone and takes line .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Speaking into telephone — very sweetly .</stage>Yes , are you there ?— yes — who are you ? Speak a little louder , please . Oh !— Well ? Yes — I do n't know — Mr. Parbury 's just coming in now — he 'll speak to you — keep the line .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She returns to the desk .</stage>
    <stage>Enter MR. PARBURY from garden . His hair is untidy ; he is flustered and cross . He is an agreeable-looking man of about forty .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Thank heaven , they 're gone ! This house is a mistake ! With the nerve force one expends in swearing at street singers one might do some good work . Make a note , please — look for house in secluded part of country .<stage>MISS WOODWARD makes note .</stage>And make a note — write Times re Street Music ; suggest Local Option .</p>

     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>The Saturday Sentinel is waiting to speak to you on the telephone .</p>

     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , worrying about the article , I suppose .<stage>Goes to telephone .</stage>Hullo ! hullo !<stage>Gives them a ring up .</stage>Are you there ?<stage>Crossly .</stage>Are you there ? Well ?<stage>Pause ; he listens .</stage>Oh , of course , still harping on my article . I suppose that 's you , Jackson ? Oh , well , if you 'll keep this confounded telephone quiet , and send a man to clear the neighbourhood of street singers , you 'll have a chance of receiving the copy in half-an-hour . What ? All right , old man . Yes , yes . I 'll send it by special messenger . Yes . Goodbye !<stage>Rings off , and hangs up tube .</stage>That is another mistake — that telephone .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>I was afraid you would find it so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>You were right ! You are always right ! But my wife thought it would save me a lot of correspondence and a lot of going out .<stage>Aside , with a sigh .</stage>I always liked going out .<stage>Aloud .</stage>Make a note , please — get rid of the telephone .<stage>MISS WOODWARD makes note .</stage><stage>Goes to top of table , R. C .</stage>Now we 'll get on , please . I 've promised the article in half-an-hour .<stage>Looks at his watch .</stage>They go to press this afternoon .</p>

    </sp>
    <stage>PARBURY walks up C. and back , trying to collect his thoughts ; then he looks at MRS. PARBURY with the wish in his face that she were not there ; finally he goes over to MISS WOODWARD and speaks in a lowered voice .</stage>

     <p>Why did you send Miss Woodward away ?</p>

     <p>Of course .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Because I hate scenes before other people .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Scenes ! What do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>C .</stage>What ! Is n't there to be a scene ? How splendid !</p>

     <p><stage>L. C .</stage>I do n't understand the humour you are in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I 'm in a capital humour , dear . You 've saved me for the moment from a savage attack on the work of a man whom I respect and admire .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>You mean simply that I 've interrupted your work . You will not have reason to complain again .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Is going .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Wait , dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>No , no . There are things one can n't get over . Perhaps you can explain why it is that Miss Woodward 's presence does n't disturb you , while mine does ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Easily . Miss Woodward is a mouse .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I hate mice !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I mean she is a table — a chair — a desk — a dictionary — a something useful that is always in the right place at the right moment , and yet of whose presence one is pleasantly unconscious . She is a triumph of the negative .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>And I ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Her face is not turned to him .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Positive , my love — quite positive ; you bristle with emotions . When you are in the room , one knows it .<stage>MRS. PARBURY takes out her handkerchief and begins to cry . Pause . PARBURY , who has gone to desk , looks round inquiringly , then comes down gently and sees what she is doing .</stage><stage>Aside .</stage>Exactly !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Wiping her eyes .</stage>Of course I quite understand now that you do n't love me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Comes to her , concealing his impatience .</stage>But I do ! I do !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Oh no , you do n't ! When we were first married you did n't object to my being in the room when you were working .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I admit I did n't say so then ; I was younger , and had more patience and stronger nerves .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Turning to him with a gleam of anger .</stage>Then you admit you have always objected to my presence in your study ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smoothly .</stage>I admit I have always felt that a writing man 's writing hours are sacred hours .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>They should n't be sacred from his wife .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gently .</stage>They should be sacred to his wife , dear .<stage>Slight pause .</stage>If you were a writing woman you would understand what I mean .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sure I 'm very sorry I 'm not a genius , but you understood that when you married me , did n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Yes , darling , I quite understood that !<stage>He appears to say this quite unconsciously . MRS. PARBURY turns to him deeply offended , then suddenly goes up to leave the room . He quickly meets her , C .</stage><stage>Taking her hands .</stage>I only knew you were the best little woman in the world !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Where ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>To send Miss Woodward to you , since you prefer her society to mine .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>But I tell you I 'm scarcely conscious of the girl 's existence ; anyway , it was you who brought her here . You may remember I proposed having a male secretary .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Yes ; to make a companion of at my expense . You were always a man 's man ! If I had had more experience I would have known that by the host of men friends you had when we married .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Cheerily .</stage>I have n't them now , dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>You mean — that I —<stage>Struggling to release her hands .</stage>You are most brutal . Let me go !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Not while you are angry , dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Gently forces her into a chair , R. C .</stage>
    <stage>There is another slight pause . She is certainly angry , but she does n't attempt to leave the chair . He looks down at her , and lays a hand lightly on her hair .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Brushing his hand away .</stage>Please do n't do that . I am not a child !<stage>PARBURY takes a chair and sits next to her . Pause .</stage>Perhaps you will tell me why you have used your superior strength to keep me here against my will ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taking her hand .</stage>Do you know that I 'm very much in love with you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>You in love with me ! You do n't know what love is ! All you feel at this moment is the sort of insolent pity the strong have for the weak .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>You weak , darling ! Oh , come ! You know better than that ! You can n't be unconscious of your power !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I really do n't understand you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I only meant to remind you that after all you do always get your own way . I 'm really very glad , for I 'm sure your way must always be the best way . Oh , the power and determination of this little hand !<stage>Holding her hand .</stage>Do let me , with the deepest submission , kiss “ The Mailed Fist . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He kisses her hand .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>As it pleases you to be rude to me I shall try to bear it patiently .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I do n't mean to be rude . It 's my unfortunate way of putting things . I kissed your hand because of the real tender love my heart holds for you , and for the same reason I put back this dear , rebellious little lock of hair which has escaped from over your ear . And what a perfect ear ! It 's as delicate and fragile as a shell , and it 's just the daintiest pink possible .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Mollified .</stage>I know my ears are all right , though I think you are making fun of me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I think I 'm making love to you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Suddenly taking one of his hands in hers .</stage>Oh , if you only loved me in the way I love you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I love you in a most excellent way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>But it 's different — you do n't understand . I love to breathe the air you breathe , to hear your voice even when it 's dictating a dry article , to listen to your footsteps , to watch the changing expressions on your face . I live by the warmth your life gives me ; you do n't grudge me that , do you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Why , of course not , darling !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I love this room because it is yours , the surroundings are yours , the atmosphere is yours . When you are out ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gently patting her hand .</stage>Which is not often , dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>When you are out I always stay here , because here I get most of you ; even the thin odour of cigarette smoke is dear to me . Smoke now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Shall I ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gives him a cigarette from his case on table , and lights it .</stage>That 's delightful !<stage>Sniffs the smoke .</stage>But only because it 's you ! I used to detest tobacco .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>You dear !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Puts his arm around her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>You understand a little now , do n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Putting her head on his shoulder .</stage>
    <sp>

Enter MISS WOODWARD carrying loose type-written MS. PARBURY glances up from his magazine as she places the leaves on the desk . Oh , thanks !</p>

     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Impossible ! Tea will be taken here in a few minutes .</p>

    <stage>PARBURY looks at her suddenly and keenly as though he had never noticed her before . Slight pause . She arranges papers at desk . He is leaning against the mantelpiece .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Do you know , Miss Woodward , I believe you are more disappointed about that article than I am .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>I was certainly very interested .</p>

     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>It was so strong ! I admire strength .</p>

     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Darling , I 've got rid of a would-be intruder for you . I thought you 'd like to know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Thank you , dear ; who was it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>A horrid person named Gunning . There 's the creature 's card .<stage>Throws card into room on to chair by door L .</stage>I knew you 'd be pleased , darling ! Tea in five minutes .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Gunning ! Not George surely ?<stage>Quickly gets the card .</stage>It is ! My dear old friend ; I would n't miss seeing him for worlds !<stage>Rushes to window , opens it , and bends out .</stage>Why , there he is , going across the lawn !<stage>Shouts .</stage>George !

     <p><stage>Outside .</stage>Wait a moment , old chap !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MISS WOODWARD goes up and looks through window , comes down , and with her handkerchief carefully dusts a photograph of PARBURY which stands on book-case up L. C ., then looks at the portrait of MRS. PARBURY , which is C. on wall over mantel , shrugs her shoulders slightly , returns to desk .</stage>
    <stage>Enter PARBURY and GUNNING , R ., through window .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>C ., speaking as they enter .</stage>Quite a mistake ! I assure you , my dear fellow , my wife gave orders that I was not to be disturbed , thinking I was engaged upon an important piece of work .</p>

     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking at MISS WOODWARD .</stage>Wo n't you present me to Mrs .——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hastily .</stage>To Miss Woodward , my secretary — certainly ! Mr. Gunning , Miss Woodward .<stage>They bow . MISS WOODWARD moves to go .</stage>Do n't go , Miss Woodward .<stage>Crosses to top of table , R. C . GUNNING puts his hat and gloves on chair , L .</stage>You might very kindly get rid of some of this correspondence for me .<stage>Takes a bundle of letters from desk .</stage>“ Dear Sir ,— I would esteem it a great favour if you would send me your photograph , together with your autograph . ”<stage>Throws letter aside , and reads another .</stage>“ My dear Sir ,— I have read with the deepest interest and the highest pleasure your deservedly successful novel , ‘ The Overthrow of Harvey Masterton , ’ and feel convinced that if you knew the story of my life —— ”<stage>Repeats business .</stage>No one can deal with these people like Miss Woodward .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>It is Mr. Parbury 's — perfect civility , consistent with finality .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Sits at desk and writes letters .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Excellent !<stage>Sits and addresses PARBURY .</stage>I suppose being a popular author entails a lot of correspondence ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Awful !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>L. C .</stage>For my part , my correspondence is practically nil .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I have noticed it with pain .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I 'd have written to you , but what was the good of it ? I 'm not literary , and I 'm not married .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>And so you 've kept away for five years .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>About that .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Sits on arm of sofa , L. C .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Five years and three months — for I 've been married all that time , and you neither came to the wedding nor called on me afterwards .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I was discreet .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Discreet ! Damned unfriendly , I call it , considering the years we had been pals .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Well , the rest of our old set stuck to you , anyway . What has become of them ? Take Wybrow , for instance — an awful good chap !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Wybrow , Wybrow — what has become of Wybrow ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Never comes here , eh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Well , he did a few times some years ago , but ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I understand — a little too Bohemian .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quickly .</stage>Not for me , George , I assure you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>No , no , of course not , my dear chap . Exit Bohemian Wybrow . Then there was Carson — one of the best ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Warmly .</stage>Was n't he a good fellow ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Capital ! Where is he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Married , you know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>So I heard . You meet constantly , of course ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>No , we met them at Brighton one winter some years ago , but I do n't think our wives quite — you understand , do n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes , I understand . You dropped the Carsons . But Burleigh ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Burleigh — ah !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Laughs .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>There was a great spirit if you like ; he was your best man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Yes ; he gave me this watch .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Which you still wear . Touching constancy ! When did you see him last ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Wait a moment . What is all this interrogation for ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Idle curiosity if you like — study of life if you like . Come , out with it , when did you last have dear old Tom Burleigh to dinner ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Almost defiantly .</stage>The day we returned from our honeymoon .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Slightly awkward pause .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Musingly .</stage>About five years and six weeks ago .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Of course , I see a lot of him at the Clubs . That is to say , I used to when I was still a Club man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Which now you are not ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Which now I am not ! What does a man want with a Club when he has a home of his own ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Excellent sentiment ; but neither the sentiment nor the words are your own , Clement .<stage>Their eyes meet and they burst into laughter .</stage>I know , I know ; “ and what does a man want with men friends when he has a wife of his own , ” and “ the husband 's old friends are the wife 's worst enemies , ” and “ what I say about Clubs is , down with them ! ”</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Laughs , sits on sofa , L. C .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Suddenly serious .</stage>What the devil are you laughing at , George ? You do n't presume ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I — why , of course not , my dear chap . Only now you see how wise I was not to intrude after your marriage , not to wait for my conge as the other poor boys did ! I knew something .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>You always did , you brute ! I believe you were born knowing something .</l>
      <stage>Leans on back of sofa .</stage>
      <l>But seriously</l>
      <stage>lowers his voice</stage>
      <l>, George ,</l>
      <l>I assure you she 's the best little woman in the world !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Why , of course ; it would be impious to suggest otherwise .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Exit MISS WOODWARD .</stage>
    <stage>His eyes follow her off . ] A perfect wife , and a charming secretary ! You 're a lucky fellow , Clement !</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Is Miss Woodward charming ? On my word , I had n't noticed it , but I 'm in love with my wife , you see .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Of course you would be the last to discover that your secretary was personally pleasing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>You 're a sinister scoundrel , George , and coarse to a fault . Now , tell me what you 've been doing all these years — shedding your illusions apparently .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I 've had none to lose since I grew up . I got rid of mine about the time of measles and whooping-cough .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>It 's a pity .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Not at all . One can n't attain the proper philosophical attitude towards life while one nourishes illusions ; one can never gain perspective .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Great man ! How beautifully you talk ! I suppose you have quite a nice thing in perspectives about with you now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Pretty well .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>So much for the journey of the soul . What of the body ? Where have you been ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Round the world twice since I saw you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>What did you see on the other side ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Just what one sees on this side ; there is always a man — and a woman .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I know you were adventuring in Upper India last year , for the papers were full of a rather fine thing you did — saved a lot of miserable lives — an ordinary , manly , commonplace , heroic , English sort of thing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Oh , do n't mention that ; one was carried away by impulse .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>And so we keep our impulses even when we lose our illusions ; I 'm glad of that anyway .<stage>Then he comes behind GUNNING 'S chair , takes him by the shoulder , and shakes him .</stage>Old fool ! I can n't help liking you as much as ever !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking up with genuine pleasure .</stage>Really ?</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rises , puts his hands on PARBURY 'S shoulders .</stage>Well , I 'm glad , because I 've often been weak enough to regret not seeing you . As for your literary successes , I suppose I ought to congratulate you ; but I always knew you 'd be a great man , because you never bored me .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>I think not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>One moment . You will probably meet only my wife 's father , Colonel Armitage , and your dinner will be a fairly plain one , but I promise that your palate will not be outraged .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>

      <l>I really think not , old man . I remember the fate of old Burleigh . And</l>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>How do you do ? I 'm very pleased .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She gives him simultaneously a cold smile and a stiff handshake .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I 'm very delighted to meet Clement 's wife .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Thank you .<stage>Aside to PARBURY .</stage>She 's charming !</p>

     <p>Clement , come for your tea .</p>

     <p>In one moment , dear .</p>

     <p>You 've often heard me speak of Gunning , Mabel ; we were at Cambridge together .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Oh yes , I remember !<stage>To GUNNING .</stage>You were very great friends ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Inseparables !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I should say so !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Uneasily .</stage>Indeed !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Comes over and takes his tea .</stage>You see , Gunning had been my fag at Harrow , and my ill-treatment of him inspired a dog-like devotion .<stage>To MISS WOODWARD .</stage>Let me take your cup .<stage>Adds in a lower voice .</stage>I 've an idea !</p>

     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pouring out a fresh cup of tea for GUNNING .</stage>But of course it 's not in the nature of things that college friendships , however strong , can last always . Time estranges , does n't it , Mr. Gunning , and fate drives people into different — well , different ways of life , does n't it ? Some men marry soon . Are you married , Mr. Gunning ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Alas , no , Mrs. Parbury !</p>
    </sp>

     <p>He has too much respect for your sex , dear . Forgive me for three minutes .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Exit PARBURY , R .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Not married ! Well , I should have thought ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>That I 'm old enough to know better . I admit it .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Sits R. C .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Well , I was going to say that in marriage a man changes so much . He becomes more — more ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gently .</stage>Respectable ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Well , I was n't going to say quite that ; though , as you suggest it , no doubt it is true . I was going to say more responsible . He enters into a broader , a fuller life ; he gains in nobility , do n't you think ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Amused .</stage>Oh , no doubt Clement has improved enormously !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I 'm so glad you recognise that . You may smoke , Mr. Gunning , if you care to .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Thank you . I 'll steal one of Clement 's cigarettes if I may ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Takes cigarette from box on desk .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Of course Clement was always good and strong and clever . It only wanted marriage to — to ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>To perfect him !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Well , I was going to say to complete him ; but it comes to the same thing , does n't it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Quite , quite !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I found my happiness when I married Clement .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>You had been looking for it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Of course ; is n't that every woman 's duty ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes ; and every man 's ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Less confidently .</stage>Well , yes , I should think so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>And one 's happiness once found is worth fighting for ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Firmly .</stage>Worth fighting very hard for !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Drily .</stage>Of course .<stage>Aside .</stage>Poor Burleigh !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Lights cigarette .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>You , I suppose , have never met a woman who could make you happy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I have never met a woman whom I was sure of being able to make happy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Slightly embarrassed .</stage>Oh !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>And , anyway , the state of marriage has always appeared to me to be a state of warfare .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Gunning , you little know ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I admit the case of you and Clement to be an exceptional one . I 'm talking of ordinary cases — the average marriage ; there you will find , according to my observation , an endless war — a war of self-interests , a war of opposing emotions , a war of irreconcilable nervous organisations ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Mr. Gunning !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Viewed from the hill-tops rather a pitiful sort of war , in which can be won neither the full joys of love nor the complete glories of battle .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Mr. Gunning !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I remain single , Mrs. Parbury , quite without happiness — except in the reflection that I am neither an oppressor exercising a daily tyranny , nor a slave rightly struggling to be free .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Of course I do n't in the least agree with you .<stage>The telephone bell rings .</stage><stage>Rising .</stage>There 's some one on the telephone — forgive me .<stage>Goes to telephone box and puts the communicator to her ear .</stage>Are you there ?— yes — who are you ?— the article — yes — no , you can n't have it to-day — no , it has n't a million to one chance of being finished .<stage>To GUNNING , with a smile .</stage>That 's Clement 's slang , not mine .<stage>Again into telephone .</stage>What ? Enter PARBURY and MISS WOODWARD , R . I say it has n't a million to one chance of being finished .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>What ? Who is it ?</p>

     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>It 's the Saturday Sentinel .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>But , my dear , the article is finished .<stage>Rushes to telephone .</stage><stage>MISS WOODWARD and GUNNING are laughing secretly . MRS. PARBURY stands C ., rather confused .</stage><stage>At telephone .</stage>Hullo ! Hullo ! Are you there ?<stage>Rings violently .</stage>Hullo — oh ! is that you , Jackson ? . . . what 's the matter ?<stage>Rather a long pause . He smiles while listening .</stage>No , no , not at all , my dear chap . What was said was , ‘ It 's a million to one you 'll have the copy in half-an-hour ’ — eh ?— yes , those were the very words . . . no , quite a mistake , you do n't listen properly . A messenger has just gone off in a cab with it . What ? Yes .<stage>Laughs .</stage>All right ! Good-bye !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Seeing MISS WOODWARD laughing .</stage>I really do n't know what there is to laugh at , Miss Woodward .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>I was only smiling at the messenger in the cab .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Folds MS. and puts it in envelope .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Yes , send some one at once , please , Miss Woodward .</p>

     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>It was n't my fault , dear . You know you did use those words .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>My fault entirely .<stage>Aside to GUNNING .</stage>Have you told her ?</p>

     <p>What ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>About the yachting ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Embarrassed .</stage>Well , it 's my yacht , Mrs. Parbury , but she 's very small — only a little tub of a thing ; and —<stage>Looks at his watch .</stage>By Jove ! I 'll never be able to dress and get back for dinner if I do n't hurry .<stage>Gets his hat and gloves , L.

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>No , dear , certainly not . You 're quite right . I would n't think of letting you run any risks .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Oh yes , I own I 'm disappointed . I looked for a good time for a few days . You were the only one of the old lot available , and you were the best of them . I can n't bear the new lot . They wear strange colours , drop their “ g 's , ” and get on one 's nerves .</p>

     <p>Quite . George , what the devil is a man to do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I knew a man who once interfered between a husband and wife who were disagreeing . The husband and wife each got a black eye . The man got two .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>You might at least talk .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Oh , certainly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>You know the situation .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Well , if one dare say so , I fancy you are suffering from the tyranny of a fascinating egoism .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I 'm suffering from the tyranny of tears .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>What I can n't understand is how a man of your strong nature arrived where you are .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I 'll make an effort to tell you . To begin with , I suppose I 'm fairly good-natured .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Oh yes !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Or say , if you like , of indolent habit , which after all often passes for the same thing . Then of course I was in love — I am still . One drifted . It 's so easy to give way in little things — really not unpleasant when you 're in love . And then there 's one 's work , which fills the mind and makes the little things appear smaller than they are . I say one drifted .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Sometimes , if I know you , you rebelled . What then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Promptly .</stage>Tears ! And over such absurdly paltry things ! Oh , the farcical tragedy of it all ! I wished to go shooting for a few days . Tears ! I fancied dining and spending the evening with an old chum . Tears ! I would go on a walking tour for a week . Tears ! Some one would ask me for three days ’ hunting . Tears ! Tears , you understand , always on hand . Tears — tears — tears ad ——<stage>Pulling himself up .</stage>No .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>No , that would be too low a thing to say .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Goes up R. C . Takes stopper out of the decanter .</stage>

     <p>Do you know , Clement , I really like you tremendously .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Thanks , old man . Have some more brandy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>No thanks .<stage>Pause .</stage>Do n't stop . I 'm interested .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>That 's all . I drifted , almost unconsciously , right up to to-day , for all the world like the man in the moral story-book one read as a child on Sundays , who drifted in his boat on the Erie River towards Niagara . To-night I 'm conscious — I 'm awake — I can feel the water gliding along the boat 's keel . I can see Niagara . I do n't like it . What the devil 's one to do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Get out and walk .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Pause . They smoke .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Of course , I shall change it all . I must , but it will be beastly work .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Beastly . When do you begin ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>When occasion serves . I can n't go back over this yachting business . I 've said I 'm not going .</p>

     <p>What about ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>Yourself .</p>

     <p>I 'm not interesting .</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>What do you wish to know ?</p>

     <p>All about you . May I ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Will you go away and leave me to work if I tell you ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Comes down by chair R. C .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Putting down her pen , and resting her cheek on her hand .</stage>I 'm the thirteenth daughter of a parson . Why my parents had thirteen daughters , I do n't know ; but I suppose it was because they are very poor . We were all given the names of flowers — Rose , Lily , Tulip , Mignonette — I can n't remember them all — but Hyacinth fell to my lot . Why we were called after flowers , I do n't know ; but I suppose it was because we are none of us the least like flowers . My eldest sister married my father 's curate . I do n't know why , but I suppose it was because she came first and is the plainest in the family .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laughing .</stage>Yes , well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Speaking in an even , emotionless way .</stage>Two other of my sisters run a Kindergarten , and one other is a governess . Personally I would rather be a domestic servant . The others remain at home , help in the house , and await husbands . I fear they will wait in vain , because there are so many women in our part of the country and so few men . For my part I seized an early opportunity of learning shorthand and typewriting — and — well , here I am . Now you know the story of my life .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She returns to her work .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I 'm afraid it was deuced impertinent of me to ask .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Not at all — only eminently man-like .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Pause . She works , he smokes .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>And so you have found your happiness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Oh no . I 've only just started to look for it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Oh ho ! Ambitious !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Very . Have you ever been poor ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Yes , at one time — had to pawn things .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>I mean being one of fifteen in family — large inferior joints to last for days — hot , cold , hashed , minced , shepherd 's pie —<stage>GUNNING shudders at this</stage>— too much potatoes — too much boiled rice — too much bread and dripping — too much weak tea — too much polishing up of things not worth polishing up — too much darning on too little material — and for ever giving thanks out of all proportion to the benefits received . I wish some one would write the history of a hat or a frock — I mean a hat or a frock that has marched steadily and sullenly under various guises through an entire family such as ours , from the mother down to the youngest girl . What might be written of the thoughts that had been thought under such a hat , or of the hearts that had felt under such a frock !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Why do n't you write the story ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps some day I shall try .<stage>Returns to her work .</stage>In the meantime you ought to go . You promised , you know . You have nothing more to learn . I do n't think in all my life I 've talked so much about myself as I have to you , a stranger .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She keeps her eyes on her work .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>You have been engagingly frank . I do hope I shall have another opportunity ——</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Not at all likely , Mr. Gunning .<stage>Pause .</stage>Goodnight .<stage>Still without looking up .</stage></p>

    <stage>MISS WOODWARD goes on with her work for a few moments , then drops her face on her hand in her favourite attitude .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Soliloquising .</stage>Rather than go back , I — well , I know I 'd rather die .<stage>She looks over the pages for a moment or two , then yawns slightly ; she gathers her pages together and places a paperweight over them .</stage>That will have to do .<stage>She rises , looks off R .</stage>There was actually a man ready to take a sort of languid interest in me . Quite a new experience .<stage>She takes up PARBURY 'S photograph and speaks to it .</stage>You do n't take an interest in me of any kind , do you ?<stage>To the photograph .</stage>You never will , and I do n't think I want you to . But I do want to stay near you , because you are so strong — Enter MRS. PARBURY from garden carrying the COLONEL 'S coffee cup and saucer . — and so weak , and so kind , and so foolish .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MRS. PARBURY has come down and is watching her unobserved . MISS WOODWARD slowly raises the photograph to her lips . The cup and saucer drop from MRS. PARBURY 'S hand to the floor and are broken . MISS WOODWARD , much startled , slowly turns towards MRS. PARBURY , and their eyes meet . There is a pause . Suddenly , with a quick movement , MRS. PARBURY snatches the photograph from MISS WOODWARD .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>How dare you ! How dare you !<stage>Long pause . She is almost breathless . Then she partly regains self-control .</stage>What train do you intend taking ?</p>

     <p>How dare you ask that when I have just caught you in the act of kissing my husband 's photograph ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>That was in a moment of abstraction . I was n't even thinking of Mr. Parbury .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Oh ! And you are the daughter of a clergyman !<stage>She goes up and fetches the A. B. C . from bookcase , and offers it to MISS WOODWARD .</stage>Here is the A. B. C .</p>

     <p><stage>Ignoring the remark .</stage>In the meanwhile there is no necessity that my husband should know the reason of your going . You can make some excuse . I would n't have him know for worlds .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Of course he shall never know from me — but I want you to quite understand , Mrs. Parbury , that I am not going to Carfields to-morrow . Rather than go home under the circumstances I would starve in the gutter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Well , you must find a lodging till you get other employment . You will have a month 's salary , of course . Anyway , I 'm determined you leave this house in the morning .</p>

     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Have n't you sufficient delicacy of feeling left to teach you that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Warmly .</stage>I do n't think I need lessons of delicacy of feeling from you .<stage>Slight pause .</stage>I 'm sorry I said that , and it means a great deal for me to say I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry too about the photograph . I think it all might be forgotten .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Forgotten !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>After all , I 'm only a girl ; and I 've worked very hard for Mr. Parbury . I think you might be more lenient .</p>

     <p><stage>At fireplace .</stage>I 'm very sorry for you , Miss Woodward ; but I owe a duty to myself and to my husband . You must go in the morning .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>I suppose I ought to be a lady and go , because you , the mistress of the house , wish me to . But I do n't feel a bit like a lady just now . I only feel like a poor girl whose chances in life are being ruined for a very small and innocent folly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Well , what does all this mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Fiercely .</stage>It means that I am in Mr. Parbury 's employment , not yours , and that I will take my dismissal from him only .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I can promise you that .<stage>She calls into the garden .</stage>Clement !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Exit MRS. PARBURY to garden , R .</stage>
    <stage>MISS WOODWARD throws a hard look after her . Then her eyes fall on the broken cup and saucer . She stoops , collects the fragments , and puts them in waste-paper basket . Then she goes to desk , sits and works on proof sheets as before .</stage>
    <stage>Enter MR. and MRS. PARBURY , R .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Working again , Miss Woodward ! Really , you are indefatigable !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>I 'm only correcting these proof sheets .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>No doubt Miss Woodward wishes to finish the work to-night , as she is leaving to-morrow .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Leaving to-morrow ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>I think Mrs. Parbury is mistaken .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>To MRS. PARBURY .</stage>What do you mean , dear ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I wish her to go .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I can n't tell you . It is not a thing you would understand . It is simply impossible for her to remain . In her heart she knows I am right .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Slight pause . PARBURY goes to MISS WOODWARD .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Are you satisfied here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Perfectly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>You have no wish to go away ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Not while you wish me to remain .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Do you know why my wife wishes you to go ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Will you kindly tell me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sorry I can n't . I 've promised . But —<stage>with a look at MRS. PARBURY</stage>— I do n't think that Mrs. Parbury 's reasons are adequate .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Pause . PARBURY is thoughtful .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>To MRS. PARBURY .</stage>Have you anything more to say ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I have only to repeat that it is quite impossible for Miss Woodward to stay .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Well , I have made up my mind that there is something very foolish under all this , and I shall not allow it to deprive me of Miss Woodward 's services .<stage>MRS. PARBURY looks surprised .</stage>I do n't mind saying in her presence that she is invaluable to me . I should never be able to replace her .<stage>Sense of relief on MISS WOODWARD 'S part .</stage>Now , come .<stage>Looking from one to the other .</stage>What is it ? A tiff — a stupid misunderstanding ? Oh , you women , why will you fuss about little things ? Make it up , do . Think of “ The Roll of Ages . ” Shake hands , cry , embrace , kiss , or whatever your pet method may be . Weep if you like , though personally I 'd rather you did n't . Anyway , as far as I am concerned , the incident is closed .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He turns to go .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Doggedly .</stage>Miss Woodward leaves this house in the morning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>

      <stage>Looks at his wife for a moment , then turns to MISS WOODWARD .</stage>
      <l>Miss</l>
      <l>Woodward , would you be so very kind ——</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <stage>He opens the door for her with great courtesy . MISS WOODWARD bows , and exits L. He comes to C .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Turning to him with assumed brightness .</stage>Now , darling , it will be different . Of course , I could n't say much before her . You were quite right to be nice and courteous to her now she is going .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>But I assure you she is not .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They are C. MRS. PARBURY takes his arm caressingly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>But she is — believe me , she is . Of course , we do n't want to be hard on her , and she shall have a month 's salary and a strong recommendation .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Disengaging his arm .</stage>My dear Mabel , I absolutely refuse to act in the dark . I hate mysteries . If you care to tell me what all this bother is about , I 'll judge for myself what 's the right thing to do .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Sits on sofa .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I can n't — it 's impossible . There are some things that men can n't be trusted to know about . You must leave this matter to me .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Sits next him .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>That I quite decline to do .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She again takes his arm and talks rapidly , gradually rather hysterically , towards the end appearing about to cry .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Darling , do listen . You do n't understand . You have never been like this with me before . I 'm sure I 'm not asking very much . You can easily get another secretary . Another time you shall have a man one , as you originally wanted to . You were right , dear — you often are .<stage>PARBURY rises ; crosses to R. MRS. PARBURY follows him .</stage>Darling , do be reasonable . I 've been a good wife to you , have n't I ? I 've always respected your wishes , and not bothered you more than I could help . This is only a little thing , and you must let me have my own way . You must trust me absolutely , dear . You know anything I would do would only be for your good , for you know that I love you .<stage>She takes out her handkerchief .</stage>I adore you , darling . You must give way — you must — you must !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Stepping back from her .</stage>If you cry I shall leave the room .</p>

    <stage>Sits R. Begins to write .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>With her back to the audience , in a low voice .</stage>I was n't going to cry .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I 'm glad to hear it .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MRS. PARBURY puts her handkerchief away and turns .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I had no intention of crying , dear .<stage>PARBURY still writes . Pause . She comes to desk .</stage>Shall I write out an advertisement for you , dear ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>What for ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>For a new secretary — a man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>No . My mind 's made up . I shall not change my secretary .</p>

     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Clement !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rises and goes to her .</stage>Listen , my dear Mabel . Perhaps I 'm a good deal to blame for the pain you are going to suffer now , and I 'm very sorry for you ; in many ways you are the best little woman in the world . I 've been weak and yielding , and I 've gradually allowed you to acquire a great deal more power than you know how to use wisely .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Really , Clement , you must be raving .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Listen , my dear , listen . What 's been the result ? You 've taken from me my habits . You 've taken from me my friends . You 've taken from me my clubs . You 've taken from me my self-esteem , my joy in life , my high spirits , the cheery devil that God implanted in me ; but , damn it , you must leave me my secretary .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Excitedly walking the stage .</stage>Oh , I understand now . You use this exaggerated language , you make these cruel accusations , you work yourself into a passion , because you have grown to think more of Miss Woodward than of me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Now you know that to be a purely fantastic interpretation of what I said .<stage>She takes out handkerchief .</stage>I observe with pain , too , that you are about to cry again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Puts handkerchief up her sleeve , controls her anger , and becomes very determined .</stage>You are quite wrong . Probably I shall never again know the relief of tears . Your callousness and obstinacy seem to have dried up all the tenderness in me . Miss Woodward leaves this house in the morning , or I leave it to-night .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coming to her .</stage>Oh , come , come , Mabel , that is too ridiculous .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I 'm very , very serious . Please , for your own sake , understand that . Which is it to be ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>There , dear , let 's drop it now . Do n't you think domestic squabbles like this , besides being boring , are just a little — may one say it , vulgar ? Let 's go back to the garden .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>

     <p>Yes .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling confidently .</stage>I do n't think she 'll go .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Enter EVANS , L .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EVANS</speaker>
     <p><stage>To COLONEL .</stage>Your carriage , sir .<stage>PARBURY looks uneasy .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Exit EVANS , L .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COLONEL</speaker>
     <p><stage>Whistles . Looks at his watch .</stage>I think she means it . I ordered my man to wait in the Avenue till he was called . Mabel has evidently had him called .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PARBURY is thoughtful .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COLONEL</speaker>
     <p>I do n't wish to be in the least degree meddlesome ; but , well , there it is !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>The question , I suppose , is what 's it all about ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COLONEL</speaker>
     <p>Well , yes . I suppose that 's it ; although I do n't in the least wish to know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>You hear , George ; what 's it all about ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Down R ., almost angrily .</stage>Now , how the deuce should I know ? Colonel , you would be very kind if you would use your authority to prevent Clement dragging me into his domestic difficulties . Married men have a cowardly way of endeavouring to involve their friends . Perhaps you have noticed it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COLONEL</speaker>
     <p>I have , Mr. Gunning . My experience of married life extended over a period of twenty-six years .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>May one discreetly express the hope that they were very happy years ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COLONEL</speaker>
     <p>Very happy years , with , however , I must admit , intermittent troubles . Mabel 's mother was one of the best women in the world , but , if I may say so without disloyalty , she was just a little — a little — er — give me a word .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Would the word exigeant apply ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COLONEL</speaker>
     <p>Admirably . Perhaps you have noticed in Mabel the slightest tendency ? Eh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Well , well !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COLONEL</speaker>
     <p>Her mother 's jealousy , too , was something amazing . I hope I 'm not conceited , but in those days I was just a little — er — popular , and perhaps I ought not to confess it , a little — er — give me a word .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Human .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They laugh slightly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COLONEL</speaker>
     <p><stage>With affected severity .</stage>Clement , I hope you are not too human ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Quite the contrary , I assure you , Colonel .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COLONEL</speaker>
     <p>Then why — I suppose , after all , it is my duty to ask — why does Mabel come home with me to-night ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>She is simply using pressure to get her own way in a matter in which I think her way the wrong way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COLONEL</speaker>
     <p>Gad ! they do like their own way , do n't they ? Well , no doubt she 'll be more reasonable to-morrow . I think I may trust you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>You may — absolutely .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Enter MRS. PARBURY . She has put on a hat and a cloak .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Going to GUNNING .</stage>You 'll forgive me , I 'm sure , Mr. Gunning . Good-night . You 'll have Clement all to yourself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Good-night , Mrs. Parbury .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They shake hands . PARBURY joins her , C .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a low voice .</stage>Do n't go , Mabel . It 's very foolish .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Softening .</stage>You could prevent me if you wished .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I 'm opposed to all violence .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hard again .</stage>Which way is it to be ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Firmly .</stage>My way , dear .</p>

     <p><stage>Comes down , a little astonished .</stage>By Jove , she 's really going !</p>

    <stage>GUNNING sits . PARBURY stands C ., listening . Pause . Then there is the noise of a carriage door being shut .</stage>

     <speaker>EVANS</speaker>
     <p><stage>Outside .</stage>Home !</p>

     <stage>SCENE .— The Rose Garden at PARBURY 'S house . A garden table , seat , and chairs . The next morning .</stage>
    </stage>
    <stage>Enter MISS WOODWARD . She is dressed simply , but less severely than before . Her hair is dressed more loosely . She carries a little basket full of roses . She places some roses upon the table , which is laid for two for breakfast . She plucks more roses and fastens them in her dress . Meanwhile she hums an air and conveys the impression of being happier than in the previous Acts .</stage>
    <stage>Enter GUNNING , R. He wears a light morning suit , a round hat and brown boots , and carries a stick and gloves .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Good-morning , Miss Woodward .</p>

     <p>Good-morning .</p>

    <stage>They shake hands .</stage>

     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Shall I resist the temptation to pay you a compliment ?</p>

     <p><stage>Gathering more roses .</stage>Yes , please .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I thought you would say so . All the same , I feel it to be a deprivation .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Is n't that remark itself the cloven foot of compliment ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Eh — well , perhaps it is . I 'm sorry .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>And therefore unlike you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Unlike me ? What does that mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>That it is n't much in your way to pay women compliments .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I hope you are doing me an injustice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>I do n't think so . You have n't a very lofty opinion of women as a sex , have you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Pretty well — pretty well ; but what makes you think so ?</p>

     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>I heard you talk , you know , yesterday afternoon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Oh yes ; one does talk a lot of rot sometimes , does n't one ?</p>

     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>

    <stage>Embarrassed pause .</stage>

     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Is Mr. Parbury down yet ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>No . But he is sure to be in a few minutes . He is generally early . Breakfast , as you see , will be served here . Perhaps — perhaps you would rather wait indoors .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>No ; I 'll stay here if I may . . . . I 'm afraid we made rather a late night of it .</p>

    <stage>He sits .</stage>

     <p>You had much to talk of . I envy people with pleasant memories .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I do n't remember that we talked much of old times . I think we talked of the present .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rather hardly .</stage>Then my envy has flown .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>You are right . This affair is rather boring .</p>
    </sp>

     <p><stage>Leaning on chair , L. C .</stage>I 'm sure that is very clever , because I can n't quite understand it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Quite seriously , Miss Woodward , you interest me more than any person I have ever met .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Do you always say that to girls , Mr. Gunning ?</p>

     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>No . Why ?</p>
    </sp>

     <p>You ought to . I 'm sure it 's very encouraging .</p>

     <p><stage>Doubtfully .</stage>Ahem !</p>

     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Are you quite sure you would n't rather wait indoors ?</p>

     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Oh , quite . I like being here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>But I 'm sure you find it difficult getting down to one 's level . I often think that the very wise must be very lonely .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rising .</stage>What an extremely unpleasant remark !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sorry .<stage>She sighs .</stage>We do n't seem to get on very well , do we ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>With sincerity and coming close to her .</stage>I 'd like to get on well with you .</p>

    <stage>Pause . They look in each other 's faces , both at table .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>

     <p>Not at all . But , really , you married men are very tiresome .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I see — wanted a rose yourself . Shall I call Miss Woodward back and ask for you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Do n't trouble . I 've done that myself .</p>

     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>You have ? Ha , ha !<stage>Begins to laugh , but stops suddenly .</stage>Oh !<stage>Holding his head .</stage>Dear , dear , what a head I have !</p>

     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I am . It 's fifteen years old . Enter EVANS , L ., with , breakfast-tray . But you always had a way of mixing your drinks over-night and growling in the morning .</p>

     <p>You know what I mean . How much sleep do you think I 've had ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sure I do n't know . What concerns me is that you detained me in this outlandish place — what county is it ?— till past three o'clock , and then insisted , with alcoholic tears in your eyes , on my returning to breakfast .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Tea or coffee ?</p>

     <p>I am your guest .</p>

     <p>Perhaps we had better split a bottle .</p>

     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Please be frank . Do you mean Bass or champagne ?</p>

     <p>It 's a thing I have n't done for years — taken wine in the morning .</p>

     <p>You mean ours .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Always what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Toast ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Thanks , I 've got some . Always what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>It 's quite pleasant out here , is n't it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Delightful . You were saying I was always ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , it does n't matter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Of course , being about me it would n't matter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I 'm afraid of offending you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>You could n't do that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Well , I was going to say you were always rather sour-natured .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Really !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He takes up a daily paper and glances through it , continuing to do so while PARBURY speaks .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>And that has , I fancy , quite unconsciously to you , I am sure , a disturbing influence on others of happier nature .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Taking an egg .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Drawlingly .</stage>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He continues to read .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Take yesterday , for instance . Of course , you did n't intend it . I would n't suggest that for a moment . But , damn it , look at the result ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>In the same manner as before .</stage>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He reads .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taking the top off his boiled egg .</stage>Simply deplorable . I 've broken loose from my moorings . I 'm at the mercy of every breeze . I feel that I 've lost moral stability . Confound it , why does n't that champagne come ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Enter EVANS , L ., with champagne . Pours out two glasses and hands them to GUNNING and PARBURY .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I 'm not quite certain that for a man like me —<stage>GUNNING groans and returns to his newspaper</stage>— a man , if I may say so , of generous instincts and large sympathies — a groove is n't a good thing , even if it be a little narrow . Of course , for a man of your nature , it 's a different matter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Suddenly puts down the paper , draws his chair closer to the table , and takes an egg with apparent cheerfulness .</stage>What were you saying , old man ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Nothing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Affecting heartiness .</stage>Let 's talk about you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Fingering the rose in his buttonhole .</stage>Dear , dear , how cross you are to-day !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EVANS</speaker>
     <p>Excuse me , sir , may I speak to you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Yes — what is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EVANS</speaker>
     <p>It 's about cook , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>What 's the matter with her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EVANS</speaker>
     <p>Well , sir , so to speak , she wants to know where she stands .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looks at EVANS , then at GUNNING .</stage>How can I help her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EVANS</speaker>
     <p>I mean , sir , or rather she means , now mistress has gone away ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I presume my wife has a right to go away for a few days without cook 's permission .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EVANS</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir , certainly . But excuse me , sir ; there 's been gossip . Emma , the ‘ ousemaid , accidentally overheard something between Mrs. Parbury and her maid . Servants is as nervous as race-horses , sir , and cook 's nerves is particularly sensible . So to speak , dismoralisation 's set up in the kitchen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Well , you had better go and set it down again , Evans , and do n't bother me any more .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EVANS</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir , certainly . Excuse me , sir , I was to ask you who cook is to take her orders from .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>In my wife 's absence , from me , of course .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EVANS</speaker>
     <p>Not from Miss Woodward , sir ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Staring slightly .</stage>Why , has Miss Woodward given any orders ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EVANS</speaker>
     <p>No , sir , but cook thought ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>That will do , Evans .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EVANS</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Exit EVANS , L .</stage>
    <stage>There is a pause . PARBURY and GUNNING exchange looks .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Devilish awkward .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>What bores servants are !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PARBURY slowly drinks a glass of wine . GUNNING also drinks . PARBURY re-fills the glasses .</stage>
    <stage>Enter COLONEL ARMITAGE , R .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>Am I an intruder ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Good-morning , Colonel .<stage>He rises and shakes hands .</stage>Not in the least .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p><stage>At back of table , C .</stage>Good-morning , Mr. Gunning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Good-morning , Colonel .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They shake hands .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Have you breakfasted ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>Thanks , yes , but poorly . I did n't get to bed till four .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Nor did I .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Nor I .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>And then I had but little sleep .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>The same with me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>And with me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a touch of asperity .</stage>Your troubles , Clement , you have , of course , brought upon yourself ; but I think it 's a little hard on your friends that they should be made to suffer with you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Hear , hear !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Enter EVANS with fruit . GUNNING and PARBURY each take an apple .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Tapping the champagne bottle with his stick .</stage>What 's this ! Some new kind of table water , I suppose .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Champagne .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>Champagne at this hour ! Well , I suppose you know best how to regulate your life . Have you an extra glass ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Another glass , Evans .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EVANS</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Exit EVANS .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>It 's a thing I have n't done for many years .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I trust , Colonel , you wo n't accuse me of leading you from the path of morning abstinence .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>Really , Clement , I think this display of ill-humour is scarcely in — er — give me a word .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Good taste .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>Exactly ! Good taste , considering that we are suffering from the effects of your domestic — er — er ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Maladministration .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>Maladministration — exactly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I quite agree with you , Colonel .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>Look at your friend there . If he 'll allow me to say so , he 's put on ten years since yesterday . Look at me ! Last evening , I suggest — I hope I 'm not conceited — I suggest I did n't look a day over forty-seven .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Not an hour .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>While to-day — what would you say , Mr Gunning ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looks at him critically , then falls back in his chair .</stage>Fifty-two .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PARBURY looks savagely at GUNNING , throws his apple on table , and turns away .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>I feared so ; but I like you for your frankness .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He cuts a cigar .</stage>
    <stage>Enter EVANS , with tumbler on tray ; he places tumbler on table , and collects the breakfast things . Pause . ARMITAGE lights his cigar with a match EVANS hands him .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>You have n't asked me if I have a message for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Prenez-garde !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Loudly .</stage>You mean about Newmarket .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p><stage>After a glance at EVANS .</stage>Yes ; Allerton does n't run any of his horses . Death in the family , you know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>So I heard . That will do , Evans . You may leave the champagne .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They all keep their glasses .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EVANS</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Exit EVANS with breakfast tray , L .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Watches EVANS off ; then to ARMITAGE .</stage>Of course , you know , I 'm really most anxious about Mabel . How is she ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>I think I told you that I was up practically all night with her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Was she ill ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>Bodily , no . We supped in the kitchen at two . It 's amazing how emotion stimulates the appetite . No , Clement , her indisposition is of the mind . She wept .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>All the time ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>All the time .<stage>Slight pause . Then he adds with a sigh .</stage>I had rather a trying night .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They all drink champagne ; GUNNING rises , bends over a rose-bush , and hums the air of the music-hall song , “ ‘ E ‘ as my sympathy . ”</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>I 'm not without experience . Poor dear Mabel 's mother , for instance — one of the best women in the world — she would cry at times , and if she got well off the scratch , she was — er — hard to beat . Mind you , I 'll be fair ; I was much to blame — very much to blame . But as for Mabel , bless you , that dear child could have given her poor mother a stone and — er — what 's the expression ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Romped home .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>That 's it — romped home .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Come , Colonel , give me the message .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>I have no message for you . I may tell you , you are not in very great favour .<stage>GUNNING smiles .</stage>You 're not well spoken of , Clement .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Oho ! Perhaps my wife had a good word for my old friend , Gunning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>In regard to Mr. Gunning , I think the word “ serpent ” was employed .<stage>PARBURY laughs quietly ; GUNNING becomes serious .</stage>All the same , I have a message for him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Really .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rising .</stage>In that case , I 'll get out of the way . I shall be in my study if I 'm wanted .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Comes C .</stage>Very well . But I must say , Clement , that I find you , very much to my surprise and regret , just a little — a little — er — give me a word .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Callous !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>Thanks , yes — callous ; and , dearly fond as I am of my daughter , I think I have a right to ask how long you intend leaving your wife on my hands .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Perfectly reasonable — perfectly ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Shut up , George !<stage>He goes to ARMITAGE .</stage>My dear old friend ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Interrupting .</stage>Hear me out , please . My dear daughter is , of course , always more than welcome to my home , but I trust you will not misunderstand me when I say that I require notice . Since I regained my liberty — I mean , since the death of your wife 's dear mother , I 've drifted into my own — er — little ways . This affair has deranged my plans . Without being indiscreet , I may tell you that I 've had to send telegrams .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Deuced hard lines !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Send her back to me , Colonel . Consult at once your happiness and mine by using your authority . Tell her that cook is in revolt , and that Evans is impertinent . Tell her that I only want my own way when I know I am absolutely right , as in this case . And above all , tell her that I prefer her society to that of a second-class cynic who bellows for champagne at ten o'clock in the morning .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Exit PARBURY , L .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>In regard to your son-in-law , Colonel , you have my respectful sympathy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>A good fellow , but inconsiderate .<stage>He lowers his voice .</stage>I may tell you in confidence , Gunning , that I had been looking forward to keeping a rather pleasant appointment to-night ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Falling into the confidential manner .</stage>Really !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , rather pleasant — rather pleasant .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He takes a miniature from his pocket and looks at it .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Leaning towards him .</stage>Might one venture to ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Keeping the miniature away from him .</stage>Oh , no , no , no , no — would n't be fair . Oh , no . Besides , you might know her hus — you might — er ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes , of course ; one can n't be too discreet .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quickly .</stage>Not , mind you , that there 's anything the whole world might n't know , only she — er — she 's not happy at home , and a quiet evening at a theatre — you understand ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Quite , quite !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>Now you , my dear fellow , can do me a friendly turn .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I should be delighted to , but — I do n't see ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>I 'll explain . My daughter wishes to see you . She seems to think that you hold the key of the situation .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>But I do n't . I should very much object to .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>Never mind — never mind ! See her and do your utmost to make it up between her and Clement .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>It 's no business of mine .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>To put it bluntly , I shall not be able to keep my appointment to-night if I still have my daughter on my hands .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>That would be a pity .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>In which case my friend will be vexed — very vexed . I should have mentioned that on her mother 's side my friend is Spanish .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling . Shakes hands .</stage>That decides me . Where is your daughter now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>She 's there , my boy , quite close . We walked over the heath together . One moment .<stage>He brings a chair forward .</stage>Would you kindly lend me your arm ?<stage>With GUNNING 'S assistance he mounts a chair , then he raises his hat on his stick .</stage>That 's the signal the coast is clear . Trust an old campaigner . There she is ! I say , put that wine away !<stage>GUNNING puts the bottle under table up L. C ., and places the glasses on table and covers them over with serviette .</stage>It 's all right ! Thank you , thank you !<stage>As GUNNING helps him down .</stage>Remember , my dear fellow , that I 've trusted you implicitly . My happiness is in your hands . If we men did n't stand shoulder to shoulder in these little matters , society would — er — would ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Crumble to dust .</p>

     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>Exactly .</p>

    <stage>Enter MRS. PARBURY , R. Advancing cautiously , she bows very stiffly to GUNNING , who takes his hat off .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Good-morning , Mrs. Parbury .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coldly .</stage>Good-morning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>Well , I 'll leave you . There 's nothing further I can do for you at present , dear ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>You might stay in the garden and give me a signal if Clement is coming . I have no intention of meeting him under the circumstances .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p>Very well , I 'll give you an unmistakable signal . “ I 'll sing thee songs of Araby . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Exit ARMITAGE , L .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Grimly .</stage>Well , Mr. Gunning , I hope you 're satisfied with your work .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>My work , Mrs. Parbury — come , come !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I hope you wo n't dispute that . Clement and I were living together in perfect harmony , in perfect happiness , until you turned up yesterday .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Like a bad penny , eh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I was going to say like the snake in the garden .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Better still . Our conversation does n't open propitiously . Do n't you think it would conduce to the comfort of us both if we did n't pursue it any further ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Is n't that a little cowardly ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I acknowledge cowardice in regard to other people 's affairs .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Yesterday you were a hero .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Believe me , Mrs. Parbury , you are mistaken . I did n't interfere in any way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>You did worse .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>How ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>You sneered .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Really , Mrs. Parbury , I ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>You aired opinions to me — pernicious opinions . I have a right to assume that you aired the same opinions to Clement , over whom you have some sort of influence .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Not , I think , a good influence , Mr. Gunning . I 've been thinking things over since midnight . Hitherto I 've been obliged to think very little of serious things . Perhaps trouble sharpens the intelligence . I 've discovered that your influence over Clement is the influence of ridicule — the ridicule of the untamed for the tamed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Say of the disreputable for the respectable , if you like , Mrs. Parbury .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Thank you . That quite expresses my present opinion . Of course it is in your power at least to modify it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I should be grateful if you would show me the way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>You are not sincere .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>‘ Pon my word , I am .<stage>MRS. PARBURY raises her hand protestingly .</stage>No , but really — I assure you , dear Mrs. Parbury — I 'm not nearly such a bad fellow as you think . What can I do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Something — anything to remove Miss Woodward from this house .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Miss Woodward ! What has she to do with your quarrel with Clement ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Everything . Sit down .<stage>He does so . She makes sure that they are unobserved , then takes a chair next him .</stage>Mr. Gunning , strange as it may appear after all that has occurred , I am going to trust you .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Lowering her voice .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>You are very good .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>That wretched girl is in love with Clement .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Starting from his chair as if shot .</stage>What !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Sit down ! Sit down !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Miss Woodward is in love with ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Sit down , please , Mr. Gunning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laughs — sitting .</stage>No , no , no ; I simply can n't believe it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Why not ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>It seems such a monstrous absurdity .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Laughs .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Drawing herself up .</stage>I see nothing monstrously absurd in any one falling in love with my husband . I did !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Oh , of course — a charming chap ; but she 's such an original girl .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Indignant .</stage>You infer that I am not ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Not at all , Mrs. Parbury . You are really most interesting .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I do n't think you are very tactful .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I 'm a boor — a perfect boor .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>You appear to take an interest in Miss Woodward .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Confused .</stage>Only the interest of the student . I still think you must be mistaken .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Emphatically .</stage>I caught her in the act of kissing his photograph .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>You saw her —<stage>Laughs .</stage>My dear Mrs. Parbury , a day-dream !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>A fact . When pressed , she did n't deny it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Does Clement know ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>No ; I thought it wise not to tell him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Heartily .</stage>You were right — very right .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I 'm glad you think so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Some men are so weak .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Drawing herself up again .</stage>Mr. Gunning !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>So easily flattered .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>With more emphasis .</stage>Mr. Gunning !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>In nine cases out of ten it 's vanity that leads men astray .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>With growing wrath .</stage>Mr. Gunning , we are speaking of my husband .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes , dear old Clement has his share of vanity , of course .<stage>Aside .</stage>Damn him !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Rises and goes L .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rising indignantly .</stage>How dare you speak like that of my husband ! A less vain man does n't exist , and what small faults he has concern only him and me — and not you in any way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I beg ten thousand pardons , Mrs. Parbury . Of course you know Clement far better than I do . Please do n't go .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I shall certainly not remain to hear my husband abused .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>But I assure you ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Crosses to L .</stage>Clement vain indeed !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>No , no ; a mistake . Do sit down again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Crosses to R. C .</stage>You might , with advantage , look for vanity nearer home , Mr. Gunning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MR. GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Perfectly true , perfectly true .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He places her chair for her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>As for the sort of weakness you were good enough to credit my husband with ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Nothing but a slip of the tongue . Do sit down .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>No doubt you have accustomed yourself to judging other men from your own standpoint .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>That 's it ; quite true ! You are always right . Wo n't you sit ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She sits . He sighs with relief , then takes a chair himself .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>What do you propose ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I 'm waiting for a suggestion from you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>This brazen hussy ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>That expression seems to me to be unnecessarily harsh , Mrs. Parbury .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , of course , if you defend the girl ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Pardon me , but I have an old-fashioned prejudice against speaking ill of the absent .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I did n't observe it when you spoke of my husband .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laughing .</stage>Fairly hit . Come , let 's be practical . Miss Woodward must not remain in the house , and Clement must not know the truth . On these points we are quite agreed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Quite .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Very well . I 'll see Clement . I have an idea .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Rises .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rises .</stage>You 'll not tell him you 've seen me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Certainly not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Remember above all , it 's most important to our future happiness that</l>
      <l>Clement should be the first to give way .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I 'll remember that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>And , Mr. Gunning , if you succeed I 'll try to forget the mischief you 've created , and will ask you to come and see us —<stage>shakes hands with him</stage>— occasionally .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Thank you so much .</p>

    <stage>Voice of COLONEL ARMITAGE outside singing “ I 'll sing thee songs of Araby . ”</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>That 's father 's signal . I am going to walk on the heath . I 'm far too proud to allow myself to be discovered by Clement here . He might think I want to come back .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Exit MRS. PARBURY , R .</stage>
    <stage>Voice of ARMITAGE , still singing , comes nearer until he enters with PARBURY , with the words “ or charm thee to a tear . ” Unseen by PARBURY , GUNNING points out to the COLONEL the direction in which MRS. PARBURY has gone .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a low voice , to GUNNING .</stage>Will it be all right ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I hope so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARMITAGE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Going R .</stage>Well , I 'll finish my constitutional . I 'll look in again , Clement , in the hope that you will then be able to tell me how long this extremely uncomfortable state of affairs is to last .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Exit ARMITAGE , R ., singing until he is well off .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Give me a cigarette , George .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>GUNNING hands him a cigarette , then takes a cigarette himself . They both smoke . There is a short silence .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Not a stroke of work . It 's absurd !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Throws cigarette on ground in a rage .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>You are not happy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Not particularly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Then how can you expect to do imaginative work ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Quite so !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I 'm afraid you 've made a mistake , old chap .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Eh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>You know I 'm your friend .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Of course .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Apart from all chaff .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Well , you 've gone too far .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looks at him .</stage>You think so ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Yes . By a petulant discontent you 've precipitated an awkward crisis .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>You see it now in that light .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Yes . I 've been thinking things over , Clement .<stage>Sits on front of table , C .</stage>After all , the love of a good woman is a priceless possession .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>You appear to have dropped into the platitudinous .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>With much gravity .</stage>Do n't jest , old man , over so sacred a thing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>After eyeing GUNNING keenly for a moment .</stage>You have changed your views since yesterday .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Only the unimaginative never change their views .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>You think , then , I 've been wrong ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Very !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I should have gone on putting up with the existing conditions ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>They might have been worse .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Submitting to the old tyranny ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>A wholesome discipline , believe me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>What of our spoilt yachting cruise ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I ought never to have proposed it . Think what a loving wife must suffer under the circumstances — lying awake at night listening to the wind howling in the chimneys and sobbing in the trees . It does n't bear thinking of .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Quite so — quite so ! And about our dear old friends whom I was obliged to drop . You may remember you made some very strong comments on my weakness yesterday .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I was hasty . I admit it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Wybrow , for instance — an awful good chap .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>A tavern wit — a Johnsonian spirit — eminently out of place on the domestic hearth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Well , take Carson — one of the best .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Foolishly married a woman your wife could n't get on with . You admitted it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>But Burleigh — a truly great spirit — your own words .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Burleigh ? It is n't because a man gives you a watch that you need thrust him down your wife 's throat , is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>What an old fraud you are , George !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Not at all . One sees things more clearly in the morning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Well , since you 've resigned your attitude of nonintervention , what do you advise ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I 'm to send for my wife ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Exactly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Unconditionally ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Of course . Why impose conditions on a weak , loving , trusting woman ?<stage>Going to him .</stage>Damn it all , old man , show a little heart .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>You know it means the sacrifice of my secretary ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>A little embarrassed ; he drops his cigarette and places his foot on it .</stage>It 's obvious that Miss Woodward can n't stay on here in your wife 's absence .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I 've thought of that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>You heard what Evans said . The servants are talking already — and if the servants are talking this morning the neighbours will be talking this afternoon , and the entire north-west of London by the evening .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Quite true — quite true !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I suppose you do n't wish to compromise the girl ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Certainly not — certainly not !<stage>He goes slowly over to GUNNING , and looks him in the face , smiling .</stage>And so that 's your secret .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>What do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>All this solicitude for my happiness — this sudden change of your point of view — this miraculous conversion of the cynic into the peacemaker — all inspired by a pair of blue eyes . An arrow from Cupid 's bow has winged its way into this wooden heart —<stage>Tapping GUNNING 'S chest</stage>— and “ Earth has won her child again , ” as Goethe puts it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Do n't talk rot !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Do n't be offended . I like it . It pleases me . Think of it ! One dull evening in a suburban home , one morning 's encounter in a rose-garden , and the thing 's done — the sage melts into the man , the onlooker into the soldier . I tell you I like it . It 's so natural , so human — so splendidly unlike you . Let me help . What can I do ? She 's coming here now with some letters for me to sign . “ Were it ever so airy a tread , your heart would hear her and beat . ” Is n't it so ? Shall I speak to her for you ? Better still , shall I leave you alone together ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Fixing his hat on more firmly and taking his stick .</stage>I 'm going . You bore me .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Enter MISS WOODWARD , L. She carries some typewritten letters and pen and ink . She goes to the table and stands waiting for PARBURY .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>One moment , old man .<stage>He looks in GUNNING 'S face , then speaks in a lower voice .</stage>Do n't let it pass unrecorded . You have permitted yourself a blush .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Trying to pass him .</stage>Do n't be an idiot .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Restraining him .</stage>It 's a beautiful , touching truth . The philosopher — the man who has gained perspective — the student who sits perched on a lofty ledge and looks down pityingly on the rest of us , is actually blushing — blushing a poor , simple , human blush !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Laughs loudly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Go to the devil !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Exit GUNNING , R .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Turning to MISS WOODWARD . He goes to her .</stage>Forgive my laughter , Miss Woodward , but it is n't often one surprises a philosopher in a blush . Now , let us see !<stage>He sits and takes the letters . MISS WOODWARD remains standing by him . He reads . Interrupting himself after a moment , he laughs slightly .</stage>Dear old George !<stage>He continues reading , then signs the letter . He looks over another and says “ Excellent ! ” and signs it . Then he quickly signs the other letters , sits back in his chair , and says</stage>Thank you !<stage>MISS WOODWARD gathers up the letters .</stage>I 'm afraid that 's all the work I can do to-day . I 'd like to have gone on with the novel , but it seems the mood wo n't come .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>I 'm very sorry .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>The day is out of joint .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>I wish I could do something .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>No , no , do n't you trouble . It 'll all come right presently . By the way , what a good fellow Gunning is !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Is he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Do n't you think so ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Looking at her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>I 've seen so little of him ; but I 'm sure he must be if you think so .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She is going , L .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Wait one moment , Miss Woodward . I know there was something else I wanted to say to you .<stage>She comes back .</stage><stage>He rises and paces stage thoughtfully .</stage>Oh , yes ; I know ! I 'm afraid my domestic complications have made things a little uncomfortable for you here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Astonished , drops the letters on the table .</stage>I do n't — do n't understand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I mean that you probably feel it rather awkward to actually live — night and day in the house in my wife 's absence ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Blankly .</stage>Oh , yes , yes ; quite I suppose .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Not looking at her .</stage>I do n't know much about these matters ; but I do know that you women are very sensitive , and apt to worry about what people might say .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>In the same manner as before .</stage>Yes — of course .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I thought so . Well , it has occurred to me that perhaps under present circumstances it would be better if ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>You mean for me to go away .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Pause .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a low voice .</stage>If I had been wiser I would have expected it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I mean , of course , to sleep only . Mrs. Howlands at Parkhurst House just down here lets some of her rooms I know , and probably she has a vacant bedroom now . I 'll send down presently and see what can be done . In fact , I 'll send Evans now .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Is about to go L .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Parbury !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Stopping .</stage>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Do n't send , please .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I see ; you would rather go yourself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>I would rather go altogether .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Amazed .</stage>You would rather go altogether !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>I mean I will go altogether .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Miss Woodward , what is this for ? What have I done ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Nothing that has n't been perfect kindness to me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Then why wish to go now ? I know I can n't expect to have you always , because you will some day get married .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>I shall never get married .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Nonsense ! Of course you will , and the man who gets you will , in my opinion , be a very lucky fellow ; but until that day I certainly looked forward to having the benefit of your services .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sorry if I disappoint you . Please forgive me and let me go .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>But really , Miss Woodward , I must beg for some sort of explanation . Last night you acknowledged you were perfectly satisfied . You wished to remain .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>You have unconsciously shown me to-day that I was wrong .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Indeed ! I would be glad to know how . Oh , how weary one gets of mysteries !<stage>MISS WOODWARD 'S head droops lower .</stage><stage>He walks the stage , then looks at MISS WOODWARD and pauses ; he goes to her and speaks more gently .</stage>I beg your pardon , I fear I spoke impatiently . Do understand that I only wish for your own good . I admit in our relations I 've hitherto been rather selfish . I 'm afraid writing men are prone to be so . I 've allowed you to study my wishes and feelings and nerves all the time , without giving any thought to yours . I 'll try to be more considerate in the future if you 'll only regard me as an elder brother and tell me what is troubling you now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sorry , but I can n't . I 'm ashamed that you should worry about me at all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Is it anything to do with Mr. Gunning ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Nothing at all . How could it be ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Miss Woodward , I do n't like to press you , but this general cloud of mystery is seriously affecting my nerves . At least tell me — I make it a personal favour — the cause of the quarrel between my wife and you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>It 's impossible ! Mrs. Parbury may tell you after I 've gone . I 'd rather you despised me then than now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Wonderingly .</stage>Despise you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Their eyes meet . Pause .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Passionately .</stage>Please do n't — do n't even try to guess .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>The light breaking in on him slowly .</stage>I think I understand .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MISS WOODWARD turns up stage and stands with head bowed , her back to the audience . There is a long pause . At first PARBURY does n't appear ill-pleased . He looks down at the rose in his buttonhole , and begins to raise it half-tenderly to his face . Then his face becomes grave , and he slowly removes the flower from his coat , and places it on the table against which MISS WOODWARD is standing . He takes one of her hands .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I do n't ask anything — I do n't guess anything , my dear child — my little sister . I was wrong to press you to tell me your trouble ; for what could a hardened , rough-natured man do with the secrets of a young girl 's heart ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Do n't speak like that ; only say that I may go .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Goes up C .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Thank you .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Sees the rose where he has placed it . After a slight pause she takes it up . During the following , she slowly picks it to pieces , dropping the petals on the ground .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coming down to back of table and speaking very gently .</stage>I suppose there must soon come a time to every girl of heart who goes out alone into the world — a time when life seems to press hardly upon her and weariness of the unaccustomed stress makes her heart falter , and when she longs to take rest for a time in the old childhood , in the home she perhaps once thought to be dull and dreary , in the mother 's arms that have always been ready to open with love for her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Do n't !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Sinks into chair , R. C . ; buries her face in her hands .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps you feel that that time has come now . If so , go home for a little while , and get rest and fresh strength for the battle of life . Come back to the fight soon . You are bound to succeed , because you have talent and ambition and courage .<stage>Slight pause . He takes her hand .</stage>Do n't cry . There is nothing you have lost or suffered yet quite worth a tear — Enter MRS. PARBURY , R ., GUNNING , and ARMITAGE . — nothing quite worth a tear .<stage>He is bending towards her .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MRS. PARBURY , who is slightly in advance of ARMITAGE and GUNNING , stops near MISS WOODWARD and PARBURY , brought up short by seeing their intimate position . PARBURY draws back from MISS WOODWARD , who remains upright and motionless . GUNNING and ARMITAGE , who exchange glances , remain L. MISS WOODWARD crosses L. to go .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a low voice , speaking slowly , with deep emotion .</stage>I suppose — I have still a right to ask — for some explanation ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Of what , dear ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Of this familiarity .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>You should n't mistake sympathy for familiarity . I was only giving Miss</l>
      <l>Woodward some advice about her affairs .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>What affairs ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I said her affairs , dear , not ours .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>If that is all the explanation ——</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Turns away L .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Parbury very kindly and very properly advised me to go home for a time —<stage>She comes down to MRS. PARBURY and speaks to her alone</stage>— and I — I descended to your level — I cried !</p>

     <p>Cook thought you would care for that piece of cake , Miss .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>I would . Thank cook for me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EVANS</speaker>
     <p>Yes , Miss .<stage>He goes to door .</stage>There 's still a hominous silence at the lunch-table , Miss .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taking a sandwich .</stage>That 's all right , Evans .<stage>Exit EVANS , L .</stage>After all , one must have food .<stage>She takes a respectable bite out of a sandwich .</stage>And who could over-estimate the consolations of literature ?<stage>Opens a book and reads .</stage>“ Is the calm thine of stoic souls who weigh Life well , and find it wanting , nor deplore , But in disdainful silence turn away , Stand mute , self-centred , stern , and dream no more ? ” Yes , Mr. Arnold , it is .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Takes another bite of a sandwich .</stage>
    <stage>Enter MRS. PARBURY , L .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Why wo n't you come to lunch , Miss Woodward . But oh , I see you 're having something here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>For a moment slightly confused .</stage>I — I —<stage>Drinks some of her beer</stage>— I have a railway journey before me .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She rises .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>All the more reason you should come and lunch properly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>You are very kind , but I am in no mood for merriment .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Merriment !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Are n't you all merry ? I 'm so sorry . I thought it would be all right now that I 'm going away .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I 'm afraid that wo n't make any difference . You speak as though you thought you had a grievance against me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Oh no ; I suppose it 's the other way about .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps it ought to be , but somehow I do n't feel it acutely . I feel only a dull pain . It 's a terrible thing , Miss Woodward , for a young married woman to suddenly realise that her happiness is gone . I feel that I have aged many years in the last few hours .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>So do I. I 'm sadder , but healthier .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Finishes the beer .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>It 's so much worse for me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Oh , of course our own troubles are always the worst . That is what has been called “ The vanity of grief . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Well , Miss Woodward , I 'll say good-bye . I bear you no ill-will now — really I do n't ; and I shall always be glad to hear that you are doing well , although naturally under the circumstances I can hold out no hopes of your coming back here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>In amazement .</stage>You , Mrs. Parbury , hold out hopes of my returning here ! Do you think there is enough money in the Bank of England to induce me to do that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I did n't mean it unkindly . I was only trying to say a nice womanly thing , and to show you that I did n't blame you so much for falling in love with my husband .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>I never did .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Miss Woodward , you know I saw you here .<stage>Pointing to PARBURY 'S photograph .</stage>It was the greatest shock of my life .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>You mean I kissed his photograph ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>You know you did .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a little laugh .</stage>I suppose I did .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Then how can you say ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gravely .</stage>It was a motherly kiss .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Turning away .</stage>It seems impossible to talk with you . I used to think you a serious-minded person .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Please do n't go , Mrs. Parbury , I 'm quite serious . I 'd like to explain . I think I owe it to you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Turning .</stage>Well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>You will let me be quite frank ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I shall like it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I 'll take the risk .<stage>Comes down L ., sits on sofa .</stage>Go on , please .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>The interest which I began to take in Mr. Parbury sprang in a way from what has been called the maternal instinct .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>If you go through the world exercising your maternal instinct on other women 's husbands , Miss Woodward , you 'll end badly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>I do n't propose doing so . I 'm going home to try it on my sisters .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>If you had known anything of life , you would have seen that I had sufficient of the maternal instinct for the needs of my husband .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>I 'm very , very sorry ; please do n't be angry , but I did n't think it found the right expression . It was very impudent of me , I know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Very .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>It seemed to me that you smoothed his hair when he 'd rather it was rough , and roughed it when he 'd rather it was smooth .<stage>Demurely .</stage>I think that expresses what I mean . I have a beastly sly way of noticing everything , and I began to feel sorry for Mr. Parbury . And being quite as egotistical as most girls , I began to think I should have made him a better wife than you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Oh .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Rises .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps in the remotest corner of my heart I think so still .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Indignant .</stage>Well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>But I never loved him — never in the least degree .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MRS. PARBURY , during the foregoing , has listened with anger gathering in her face , but at the end , after an apparent momentary struggle with herself , she bursts into laughter .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>I 'm glad you 're not angry .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Still laughing .</stage>It 's impossible to be angry . And so because you thought his wife bored him , you gave his photograph a nice motherly kiss . That was very sweet of you , I 'm sure .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>It was well meant , Mrs. Parbury ; and you must always remember that I did n't know you were looking .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laughing , sits on sofa .</stage>Why do you make me laugh when you must know that my heart is breaking — that I have lost my happiness for ever .<stage>Pause . She begins to laugh again . Rises .</stage>And I thought you a designing hussy , when you are only a very quaint and harmless girl .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Laughs .</stage>
    <stage>Enter GUNNING , L .; keeps the door open .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I 'm afraid I 'm in the way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Not at all . We have said all we had to say to each other . Oh , how that girl has made me laugh !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Exit MRS. PARBURY , L ., laughing . GUNNING shuts the door .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Good-bye , Mr. Gunning .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Gathering her books together .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I want a little talk with you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sorry I can n't give you the time ,</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Oh yes , you will , Miss Woodward .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Indeed ? I admit my position is a lowly one , but that does n't lessen your presumption .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Goes towards the door .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>With conviction .</stage>You wo n't go .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>But I will .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>My dear Miss Woodward , believe me , you will not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>You do n't propose using force , I suppose ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>No ; I think you would like me to , but unfortunately this is not our house , and one must observe the convenances .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Going to door , L .</stage>Good-bye , Mr. Gunning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Moral force will detain you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>What moral force , pray ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Turning .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Curiosity . You know you are dying to know what I have to say .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Indeed I am not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Oh yes , you are . And further , a certain womanly graciousness will prevent your going . You are saying to yourself , “ Mr. Gunning has evinced a genuine interest in me . It would be cattish of me to refuse him a few minutes ’ talk . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Slowly comes to sofa and puts her books down .</stage>I certainly do n't wish to be cattish .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Of course not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sits on sofa .</stage>And anyway I want to eat my piece of cake . Will you pass it , please ?<stage>He passes the plate .</stage>Thank you . I hope you wo n't mind my eating .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Not at all . I like it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Not that I fear it would make any difference if you did .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>No , certainly not . Go on being natural , please .<stage>Pause . He watches her nibbling the cake .</stage>Shall I ring for a fresh piece ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>No , thank you . I 'm used to this piece now .</l>
      <stage>She glances up at him .</stage>
      <l>You need n't be disconcerted , Mr. Gunning .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I 'm not a bit .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>You look it a little .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Do I ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>And you know you did n't detain me here to watch me eating cake .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>No , although you do it very nicely . I want to ask you what you think of me .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Leaning on back of chair , R. C .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>I have n't thought of you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Well , I 'd like you to begin .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>I 'm afraid I have n't time now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>It might be to your interest , though I do n't say positively that it would be .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Explain .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Turns to him .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I think I ought first to tell you something about myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>In mock alarm .</stage>Not the story of your life , surely . My cab will be here soon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>You told me yours last night ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>You asked me to . I have n't asked you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>You need n't reproach me for taking an interest in you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>I do n't ; but you make such a fuss about it , as if it were a sort of miracle .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Crossly takes plate from her lap and cake from her hand ; puts them on table , R .</stage>Oh well , I suppose I ought n't to detain you , Miss Woodward . You are evidently anxious to get back to your twelve sisters and the hat and frock you told me about .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rises .</stage>You need n't throw the family poverty in my face , although it serves me right for giving my confidence to a comparative stranger .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Miss Woodward , I humbly beg your pardon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Although the home may be grubby , I daresay we are as happy as you . We believe in things , anyway — you do n't .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Do n't judge me by a hasty remark . Besides , I had an alternative to suggest .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>You ? You do n't want a secretary , do you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I — I wanted to tell you in a different way , but you wo n't let me . I want you as my wife .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Your wife , Mr. Gunning ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>It may appear sudden and cold-blooded — but your cab is coming .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>You 've taken my breath away . How exciting it is when it does come . I really do n't know what to say . I know there is a usual thing . It is n't “ To what am I indebted for this honour , ” is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know . I 've never asked a girl before .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>We do n't know each other in the least .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>That 's where we would start with a big advantage . We 'd have all the pleasure of finding each other out . Anyway , you are not displeased .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Oh no ; either way I score . If I say yes , I suppose I 'll make a good match .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Pretty good .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>And if I say no , I shall at least be able to boast of a proposal .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>That 's so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Not that there 's much satisfaction in that to a practical mind .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>No ?<stage>Goes to her .</stage>Try the other .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>But we do n't love each other .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Another big advantage . Love is the rock upon which so many well-intentioned young persons split . They engage to marry each other while the intelligence is perverted , the reason unbalanced , and the judgment obscured by an overpowering sentiment . They enter into a solemn life-binding contract in a highly emotional and altogether unnormal moral condition . The disastrous results of such folly we see examples of daily . We will escape that snare .<stage>He comes close to her .</stage>Of course if the sentiment should subsequently come , if that particular kind of emotion should by chance supervene , we 'll deal with it as best we may .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sits on arm of sofa .</stage>Still there must be something in love-making . I remember my sister and the curate seemed to have a very good time . We all thought them fussy , but I know they liked it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I made love to you in the garden this morning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Did you ? I thought it was pity , and resented it</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>You refused me a rose , and gave one ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>I refused you because I thought you pitied me , and gave one to Mr. Parbury because I pitied him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I 'd like you to pity me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>I should if I said yes .<stage>Leaves him .</stage>But I mean to say no .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Following her .</stage>You are afraid .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Of what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Of what people call my “ nasty sneering way , ” for instance .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Confidently .</stage>Oh , I could deal with that all right .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sure you could .<stage>Goes near to her .</stage>Say yes , Hyacinth .</p>

     <p>Your cab is here , Miss .</p>

     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>To MISS WOODWARD , in low voice .</stage>
      <l>Send it away .</l>
      <stage>She hesitates .</stage>
      <l>Do .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Thank you , Evans . Let it wait .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>GUNNING moves away to C. with a satisfied smile .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EVANS</speaker>
     <p>Yes , Miss .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Exit L .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Good-bye , Mr. Gunning . If you were entirely different from what you are , I think I could have liked you ; or if I were entirely different from what I am , I think I might have married you . But you are hopelessly modern and cold-blooded , and I am only an old-fashioned , healthy English girl , and a healthy English girl does n't want to make experiments , she wants to be loved .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Suddenly GUNNING throws his arm round her , and bends forward to kiss her . She quickly raises her clenched hand as if to strike him in the face . He looks her in the eyes without flinching .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps she wants a master .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Softly .</stage>Perhaps .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Her hand slowly drops ; he kisses her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COLONEL</speaker>
     <p><stage>Outside L .</stage>No , my dear ; I can n't wait any longer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a low voice to MISS WOODWARD .</stage>The garden . Will you come and find me a rose ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Enter COLONEL ARMITAGE , L ., MRS. PARBURY , and MR. PARBURY .</stage>
    <stage>MISS WOODWARD and GUNNING exeunt quickly to garden , R .</stage>
    <stage>MRS. PARBURY comes down L. and sits on sofa . PARBURY goes R. and sits , ARMITAGE remains C. They are all silent and uneasy . A considerable pause , during which they are occupied with avoiding each other 's eyes .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COLONEL</speaker>
     <p>A cheerful day .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MR. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Very .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Another uneasy pause .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COLONEL</speaker>
     <p>Well , I must be going .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MR. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Do n't go .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Please stay , father .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Another pause .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COLONEL</speaker>
     <p><stage>With much irritation .</stage>Well , you see I 'm staying .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Thank you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MR. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Thank you , Colonel .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COLONEL</speaker>
     <p>But I should like to know what the devil for ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Father !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MR. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Colonel !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COLONEL</speaker>
     <p>I really think I have cause to be angry . A more depressing function than your luncheon party to-day I 've never experienced . I think I have a right to a little cheerfulness in my middle age . I 'm sure I 've earned it . I 've had a great deal to put up with in my life .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MR. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>No doubt , no doubt .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COLONEL</speaker>
     <p>Of course I have always accepted my full share of the blame . That I have felt to be only right and manly .<stage>Pause . He looks at CLEMENT .</stage>As for my late dear wife , her heart was rarely deaf to a proper expression of regret . The memory of her I feel to be a blessing to this day .<stage>He blows his nose sympathetically .</stage>One thing I can tell you , Mabel , that when your dear mother and I made it up — well , we did make it up . I am not without some very agreeable recollections — most agreeable .<stage>Pause . He comes to MRS. PARBURY .</stage>I trust you wo n't require me tonight , my dear . I have to attend a Masonic Banquet .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>No , father ; I sha n't want you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COLONEL</speaker>
     <p>Then good-bye .<stage>Aside to her .</stage>Be true to your own good heart . Your dear mother was — sometimes .<stage>He kisses her , and then goes to PARBURY .</stage>Good-bye , Clement .<stage>Aside to him .</stage>Bear up ; I 've been there myself .<stage>He goes — aside at door .</stage>Rather tactful , I think — rather tactful .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Exit L .</stage>
    <stage>There is a constrained silence . MRS. PARBURY is particularly uneasy . After a moment PARBURY rises , lights a cigarette , and stands at mantelpiece .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Am I in the way , dear ? Do you want to work ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>No .<stage>Rises , goes up R .</stage>To-day must be a holiday .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Holidays are meant to be happy days .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I suppose so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Our happy days have gone . I suppose they will never come back .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Very sadly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>It would be wiser to look for new ones than to weep over the old ones .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I 'll not cry , dear ; I promise you that .<stage>Pause . Suddenly rises and turns to him .</stage>Clement , can n't we start again ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps . But we must consider first where we now are and the direction in which we should go .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps in your heart you are blaming me more than I deserve — I mean about Miss Woodward .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>You chose to keep the motives of your conduct a secret from me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I may have been wrong . I saw her kiss your photograph .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Starts slightly .</stage>Why did n't you tell me ?<stage>Pause .</stage>Why did n't you tell me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I thought — I thought it would be wiser not to .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>What have I ever done to earn so low an estimate of my character from you — that I am not to be trusted with the knowledge that a foolish girl had kissed my photograph .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Nothing , dear ; nothing . But I was jealous — furious . I am sorry .<stage>She is half-turned from him . He smiles very kindly , and half makes a step forward as if to take her in his arms , then restrains himself .</stage><stage>Drooping .</stage>You are very , very angry with me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I am very , very pained .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Ca n't you forgive ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Yes , that is forgiven .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>You say you forgive , but you do n't make me feel it .<stage>Slight pause . He is obviously tempted to come to her , but does not .</stage>Wo n't you forget too , and let us go back together ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>No , we can never go back .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Love counts for something , Clement .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Comes to her .</stage>Does love without respect count for very much ? Would you like to go back to the old way — the way of petty tyranny — the way of the cowardly , unnecessary tear — the way of gaining your own ends at all costs — the way of being a spoilt child , instead of a thoughtful and considerate woman — the way of my own contemptible weakness ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I never looked upon it in that light . I thought I was happy then .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Because you never dreamed that my love was beginning to wear badly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Startled .</stage>Clement ! . . . Oh ?<stage>Goes to him .</stage>Good God !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I do n't want ever to think or speak of it again ; but to-day I must , for if we are honest with each other , we may be able in time to save ourselves from that most pitiable and hideous of all states of existence — what is called “ a cat and dog life . ” Have you never seen it — that domestic flower with the rotten heart ? The thin outside petals of courtesy , of hollow words of endearment before others , mask the ugly truth from the casual and unobservant ; but the intimate friends know , and the prying eyes of the spiteful are undeceived . That man and woman who appear in public wearing the veneered ghost of a smile , are walking in hell . Think of their private lives — the slow death of love ; the hearts poisoned with bitterness ; the ever-growing rancour ; the bandied insolences ; the swift thoughts , black as murder ; the final dull monotony of aching hatred . Do you think such cases rare ? Every rank of society has its examples . Do you think such a couple have deliberately sought their hell ? Oh no ; they may have started as fairly as we did . Their love has not been slain by a blow , it has been pecked to a cupboard skeleton by littlenesses — little jealousies , little selfishnesses , little insults , little tyrannies , little intolerances .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Clement , you terrify me .<stage>C. R .</stage>Oh , I am ashamed — ashamed . You have made me shudder at the old way . Dear , if I have lost a particle of your love , I 'll win it back . You will show me the new way , wo n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>The new way for us is the old way for the wise . It is a pleasant way strewn with flowers , the flowers of self-abnegation — of sweet reasonableness — of patient tolerance — of enduring trustfulness . Walking in that way we seek diligently for the happiness , not of ourselves , but of each other . Rising in the morning we say , not , I will find happiness to-day , but I will give happiness to-day . In that way lie peace , the fulfilment of our better selves , the full golden harvest of love .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>As he speaks these words with deep sympathy , standing a little away from her , she gradually draws nearer to him .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>I will walk in that way with you , Clement .<stage>She stoops , and taking one of his hands kisses it . Pause .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He stoops and raises her , and takes her in his arms .</stage>
    <stage>Enter MISS WOODWARD and GUNNING . GUNNING wears a rose in his coat .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUNNING</speaker>
     <p>Really — I beg your pardon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. PARBURY</speaker>
     <p>Do n't trouble about us any more . We 're reconciled .<stage>She remains in her husband 's arms .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <stage>GUNNING turns smilingly to MISS WOODWARD and takes her hand .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS WOODWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling back upon GUNNING .</stage>Do n't trouble about us any more . We 're engaged .</p>
