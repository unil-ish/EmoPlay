    <head type="act">THE FIRST ACT</head>
    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>The Scene is a stately drawing-room at Aston-Adey , with fine pictures on the walls and Georgian furniture . Aston-Adey has been described , with many illustrations , in Country Life . It is not a house , but a place . Its owner takes a great pride in it , and there is nothing in the room which is not of the period . Through the French windows at the back can be seen the beautiful gardens which are one of the features .</stage>
     <stage>It is a fine summer morning .</stage>
     <stage>ARNOLD comes in . He is a man of about thirty-five , tall and good-looking , fair , with a clean-cut , sensitive face . He has a look that is intellectual , but somewhat bloodless . He is very well dressed .</stage>
    </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Calling .</stage>Elizabeth !<stage>He goes to the window and calls again .</stage>Elizabeth !<stage>He rings the bell . While he is waiting he gives a look round the room . He slightly alters the position of one of the chairs . He takes an ornament from the chimney-piece and blows the dust from it .</stage><stage>A FOOTMAN comes in .</stage>Oh , George ! see if you can find Mrs. Cheney , and ask her if she 'd be good enough to come here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FOOTMAN</speaker>
     <p>Very good , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The FOOTMAN turns to go .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Who is supposed to look after this room ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FOOTMAN</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I wish when they dust they 'd take care to replace the things exactly as they were before .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FOOTMAN</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Dismissing him .</stage>All right .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The FOOTMAN goes out . He goes again to the window and calls .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Elizabeth !<stage>He sees MRS. SHENSTONE .</stage>Oh , Anna , do you know where Elizabeth is ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MRS. SHENSTONE comes in from the garden . She is a woman of forty , pleasant and of elegant appearance .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>Is n't she playing tennis ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>No , I 've been down to the tennis court . Something very tiresome has happened .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>Oh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I wonder where the deuce she is .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>When do you expect Lord Porteous and Lady Kitty ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>They 're motoring down in time for luncheon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>Are you sure you want me to be here ? It 's not too late yet , you know . I can have my things packed and catch a train for somewhere or other .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>No , of course we want you . It 'll make it so much easier if there are people here . It was exceedingly kind of you to come .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>Oh , nonsense !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>And I think it was a good thing to have Teddie Luton down .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>He is so breezy , is n't he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Yes , that 's his great asset . I do n't know that he 's very intelligent , but , you know , there are occasions when you want a bull in a china shop . I sent one of the servants to find Elizabeth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>I daresay she 's putting on her shoes . She and Teddie were going to have a single .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>It can n't take all this time to change one 's shoes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a smile .</stage>One can n't change one 's shoes without powdering one 's nose , you know .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>ELIZABETH comes in . She is a very pretty creature in the early twenties . She wears a light summer frock .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>My dear , I 've been hunting for you everywhere . What have you been doing ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Nothing ! I 've been standing on my head .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>My father 's here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Startled .</stage>Where ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>At the cottage . He arrived last night .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Damn !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Good-humouredly .</stage>I wish you would n't say that , Elizabeth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>If you 're not going to say “ Damn ” when a thing 's damnable , when are you going to say “ Damn ” ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I should have thought you could say , “ Oh , bother ! ” or something like that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>But that would n't express my sentiments . Besides , at that speech day when you were giving away the prizes you said there were no synonyms in the English language .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>Oh , Elizabeth ! it 's very unfair to expect a politician to live in private up to the statements he makes in public .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I 'm always willing to stand by anything I 've said . There are no synonyms in the English language .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>In that case I shall be regretfully forced to continue to say “ Damn ” whenever I feel like it .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>EDWARD LUTON shows himself at the window . He is an attractive youth in flannels .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I say , what about this tennis ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Come in . We 're having a scene .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Entering .</stage>How splendid ! What about ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>The English language .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Do n't tell me you 've been splitting your infinitives .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>With the shadow of a frown .</stage>
      <l>I wish you 'd be serious ,</l>
      <l>Elizabeth . The situation is none too pleasant .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>I think Teddie and I had better make ourselves scarce .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Nonsense ! You 're both in it . If there 's going to be any unpleasantness we want your moral support . That 's why we asked you to come .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>And I thought I 'd been asked for my blue eyes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Vain beast ! And they happen to be brown .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Is anything up ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Arnold 's father arrived last night .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Did he , by Jove ! I thought he was in Paris .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>So did we all . He told me he 'd be there for the next month .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>Have you seen him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>No ! he rang me up . It 's a mercy he had a telephone put in the cottage . It would have been a pretty kettle of fish if he 'd just walked in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Did you tell him Lady Catherine was coming ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Of course not . I was flabbergasted to know he was here . And then I thought we 'd better talk it over first .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Is he coming along here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Yes . He suggested it , and I could n't think of any excuse to prevent him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Could n't you put the other people off ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>They 're coming by car . They may be here any minute . It 's too late to do that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Besides , it would be beastly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I knew it was silly to have them here . Elizabeth insisted .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>After all , she is your mother , Arnold .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>That meant precious little to her when she — went away . You can n't imagine it means very much to me now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>It 's thirty years ago . It seems so absurd to bear malice after all that time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I do n't bear malice , but the fact remains that she did me the most irreparable harm . I can find no excuse for her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Have you ever tried to ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>My dear Elizabeth , it 's no good going over all that again . The facts are lamentably simple . She had a husband who adored her , a wonderful position , all the money she could want , and a child of five . And she ran away with a married man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Lady Porteous is not a very attractive woman , Arnold .</l>
      <stage>To ANNA .</stage>
      <l>Do you know her ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>“ Forbidding ” is the word , I think .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>If you 're going to make little jokes about it , I have nothing more to say .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sorry , Arnold .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps your mother could n't help herself — if she was in love ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>And had no sense of honour , duty , or decency ? Oh , yes , under those circumstances you can explain a great deal .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>That 's not a very pretty way to speak of your mother .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I can n't look on her as my mother .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>What you can n't get over is that she did n't think of you . Some of us are more mother and some of us more woman . It gives me a little thrill when I think that she loved that man so much . She sacrificed her name , her position , and her child to him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>You really can n't expect the said child to have any great affection for the mother who treated him like that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>No , I do n't think I do . But I think it 's a pity after all these years that you should n't be friends .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I wonder if you realise what it was to grow up under the shadow of that horrible scandal . Everywhere , at school , and at Oxford , and afterwards in London , I was always the son of Lady Kitty Cheney . Oh , it was cruel , cruel !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I know , Arnold . It was beastly for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>It would have been bad enough if it had been an ordinary case , but the position of the people made it ten times worse . My father was in the House then , and Porteous — he had n't succeeded to the title — was in the House too ; he was Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs , and he was very much in the public eye .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>My father always used to say he was the ablest man in the party . Every one was expecting him to be Prime Minister .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>You can imagine what a boon it was to the British public . They had n't had such a treat for a generation . The most popular song of the day was about my mother . Did you ever hear it ? “ Naughty Lady Kitty . Thought it such a pity . . . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Interrupting .</stage>Oh , Arnold , do n't !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>And then they never let people forget them . If they 'd lived quietly in Florence and not made a fuss the scandal would have died down . But those constant actions between Lord and Lady Porteous kept on reminding everyone .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>What were they having actions about ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Of course my father divorced his wife , but Lady Porteous refused to divorce Porteous . He tried to force her by refusing to support her and turning her out of her house , and heaven knows what . They were constantly wrangling in the law courts .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>I think it was monstrous of Lady Porteous .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>She knew he wanted to marry my mother , and she hated my mother . You can n't blame her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>It must have been very difficult for them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>That 's why they 've lived in Florence . Porteous has money . They found people there who were willing to accept the situation .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>This is the first time they 've ever come to England .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>My father will have to be told , Elizabeth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p><stage>To ELIZABETH .</stage>Has he ever spoken to you about Lady Kitty ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Never .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I do n't think her name has passed his lips since she ran away from this house thirty years ago .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , they lived here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Naturally . There was a house-party , and one evening neither Porteous nor my mother came down to dinner . The rest of them waited . They could n't make it out . My father sent up to my mother 's room , and a note was found on the pincushion .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>With a faint smile .</stage>
      <l>That 's what they did in the Dark</l>
      <l>Ages .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I think he took a dislike to this house from that horrible night . He never lived here again , and when I married he handed the place over to me . He just has a cottage now on the estate that he comes to when he feels inclined .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>It 's been very nice for us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I owe everything to my father . I do n't think he 'll ever forgive me for asking these people to come here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I 'm going to take all the blame on myself , Arnold .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Irritably .</stage>The situation was embarrassing enough anyhow . I do n't know how I ought to treat them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Do n't you think that 'll settle itself when you see them ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>After all , they 're my guests . I shall try and behave like a gentleman .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I would n't . We have n't got central heating .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taking no notice .</stage>Will she expect me to kiss her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a smile .</stage>Surely .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>It always makes me uncomfortable when people are effusive .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>But I can n't understand why you never saw her before .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I believe she tried to see me when I was little , but my father thought it better she should n't .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>Yes , but when you were grown up ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>She was always in Italy . I never went to Italy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>It seems to me so pathetic that if you saw one another in the street you would n't recognise each other .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Is it my fault ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>You 've promised to be very gentle with her and very kind .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>The mistake was asking Porteous to come too . It looks as though we condoned the whole thing . And how am I to treat him ? Am I to shake him by the hand and slap him on the back ? He absolutely ruined my father 's life .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>How much would you give for a nice motor accident that prevented them from coming ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I let you persuade me against my better judgment , and I 've regretted it ever since .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Good-humouredly .</stage>
      <l>I think it 's very lucky that Anna and</l>
      <l>Teddie are here . I do n't foresee a very successful party .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I 'm going to do my best . I gave you my promise and I shall keep it . But I can n't answer for my father .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>Here is your father .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MR. CHAMPION-CHENEY shows himself at one of the French windows .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>May I come in through the window , or shall I have myself announced by a supercilious flunkey ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Come in . We 've been expecting you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>Impatiently , I hope , my dear child .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MR. CHAMPION-CHENEY is a tall man in the early sixties , spare , with a fine head of gray hair and an intelligent , somewhat ascetic face . He is very carefully dressed . He is a man who makes the most of himself . He bears his years jauntily . He kisses ELIZABETH and then holds out his hand to ARNOLD .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>We thought you 'd be in Paris for another month .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>How are you , Arnold ? I always reserve to myself the privilege of changing my mind . It 's the only one elderly gentlemen share with pretty women .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>You know Anna .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p><stage>Shaking hands with her .</stage>Of course I do . How very nice to see you here ! Are you staying long ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>As long as I 'm welcome .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>And this is Mr. Luton .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>How do you do ? Do you play bridge ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LUTON</speaker>
     <p>I do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>Capital . Do you declare without top honours ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LUTON</speaker>
     <p>Never .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>Of such is the kingdom of heaven . I see that you are a good young man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LUTON</speaker>
     <p>But , like the good in general , I am poor .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>Never mind ; if your principles are right , you can play ten shillings a hundred without danger . I never play less , and I never play more .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>And you — are you going to stay long , father ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>To luncheon , if you 'll have me .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>ARNOLD gives ELIZABETH a harassed look .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>That 'll be jolly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I did n't mean that . Of course you 're going to stay for luncheon . I meant , how long are you going to stay down here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>A week .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>There is a moment 's pause . Everyone but CHAMPION-CHENEY is slightly embarrassed .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I think we 'd better chuck our tennis .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Yes . I want my father-in-law to tell me what they 're wearing in Paris this week .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I 'll go and put the rackets away .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>TEDDIE goes out .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>It 's nearly one o'clock , Elizabeth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I did n't know it was so late .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p><stage>To ARNOLD .</stage>I wonder if I can persuade you to take a turn in the garden before luncheon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Jumping at the idea .</stage>I 'd love it .<stage>ANNA goes out of the window , and as he follows her he stops irresolutely .</stage>I want you to look at this chair I 've just got . I think it 's rather good .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>Charming .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>About 1750 , I should say . Good design , is n't it ? It has n't been restored or anything .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>Very pretty .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I think it was a good buy , do n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>Oh , my dear boy ! you know I 'm entirely ignorant about these things .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>It 's exactly my period . . . I shall see you at luncheon , then .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He follows ANNA through the window .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>Who is that young man ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Luton . He 's only just been demobilised . He 's the manager of a rubber estate in the F. M. S .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>And what are the F. M. S . when they 're at home ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>The Federated Malay States . He joined up at the beginning of the war . He 's just going back there .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>And why have we been left alone in this very marked manner ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Have we ? I did n't notice it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>I suppose it 's difficult for the young to realise that one may be old without being a fool .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I never thought you that . Everyone knows you 're very intelligent .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>They certainly ought to by now . I 've told them often enough . Are you a little nervous ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Let me feel my pulse .</l>
      <stage>She puts her finger on her wrist .</stage>
      <l>It 's perfectly regular .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>When I suggested staying to luncheon Arnold looked exactly like a dose of castor oil .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I wish you 'd sit down .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>Will it make it easier for you ?<stage>He takes a chair .</stage>You have evidently something very disagreeable to say to me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>You wo n't be cross with me ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>How old are you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Twenty-five .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>I 'm never cross with a woman under thirty .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , then I 've got ten years .</p>

     <p>Mathematics ?</p>

     <p>No . Paint .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>Well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Reflectively .</stage>I think it would be easier if I sat on your knees .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>That is a pleasing taste of yours , but you must take care not to put on weight .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She sits down on his knees .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Am I boney ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>On the contrary . . . . I 'm listening .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Lady Catherine 's coming here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>Who 's Lady Catherine ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Your — Arnold 's mother .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>Is she ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He withdraws himself a little and ELIZABETH gets up .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>You must n't blame Arnold . It 's my fault . I insisted . He was against it . I nagged him till he gave way . And then I wrote and asked her to come .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>I did n't know you knew her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I do n't . But I heard she was in London . She 's staying at Claridge 's . It seemed so heartless not to take the smallest notice of her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>When is she coming ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>We 're expecting her in time for luncheon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>As soon as that ? I understand the embarrassment .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>You see , we never expected you to be here . You said you 'd be in Paris for another month .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>My dear child , this is your house . There 's no reason why you should n't ask whom you please to stay with you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>After all , whatever her faults , she 's Arnold 's mother . It seemed so unnatural that they should never see one another . My heart ached for that poor lonely woman .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>I never heard that she was lonely , and she certainly is n't poor .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>And there 's something else . I could n't ask her by herself . It would have been so — so insulting . I asked Lord Porteous , too .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>I see .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I daresay you 'd rather not meet them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>I daresay they 'd rather not meet me . I shall get a capital luncheon at the cottage . I 've noticed you always get the best food if you come in unexpectedly and have the same as they 're having in the servants ’ hall .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>No one 's ever talked to me about Lady Kitty . It 's always been a subject that everyone has avoided . I 've never even seen a photograph of her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>The house was full of them when she left . I think I told the butler to throw them in the dust-bin . She was very much photographed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Wo n't you tell me what she was like ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>She was very like you , Elizabeth , only she had dark hair instead of red .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Poor dear ! it must be quite white now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>I daresay . She was a pretty little thing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>But she was one of the great beauties of her day . They say she was lovely .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>She had the most adorable little nose , like yours . . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>D'you like my nose ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>And she was very dainty , with a beautiful little figure ; very light on her feet . She was like a marquise in an old French comedy . Yes , she was lovely .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>And I 'm sure she 's lovely still .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>She 's no chicken , you know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>You can n't expect me to look at it as you and Arnold do . When you 've loved as she 's loved you may grow old , but you grow old beautifully .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>You 're very romantic .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>If everyone had n't made such a mystery of it I daresay I should n't feel as I do . I know she did a great wrong to you and a great wrong to Arnold . I 'm willing to acknowledge that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sure it 's very kind of you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>But she loved and she dared . Romance is such an illusive thing . You read of it in books , but it 's seldom you see it face to face . I can n't help it if it thrills me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>I am painfully aware that the husband in these cases is not a romantic object .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>She had the world at her feet . You were rich . She was a figure in society . And she gave up everything for love .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p><stage>Dryly .</stage>I 'm beginning to suspect it was n't only for her sake and for Arnold 's that you asked her to come here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I seem to know her already . I think her face is a little sad , for a love like that does n't leave you gay , it leaves you grave , but I think her pale face is unlined . It 's like a child 's .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>My dear , how you let your imagination run away with you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I imagine her slight and frail .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>Frail , certainly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>With beautiful thin hands and white hair . I 've pictured her so often in that Renaissance Palace that they live in , with old Masters on the walls and lovely carved things all round , sitting in a black silk dress with old lace round her neck and old-fashioned diamonds . You see , I never knew my mother ; she died when I was a baby . You can n't confide in aunts with huge families of their own . I want Arnold 's mother to be a mother to me . I 've got so much to say to her .</p>

     <p>Are you happy with Arnold ?</p>

     <p>Why have n't you got any babies ?</p>

     <p>Lord Porteous ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>He wore his clothes better than any man in London . You know he 'd have been Prime Minister if he 'd remained in politics .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>What was he like then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>He was a nice-looking fellow . Fine horseman . I suppose there was something very fascinating about him . Yellow hair and blue eyes , you know . He had a very good figure . I liked him . I was his parliamentary secretary . He was Arnold 's godfather .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>I wonder if he ever regrets !</p>

     <p>I would n't .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Well , I must be strolling back to my cottage .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>You 're not angry with me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>Not a bit .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She puts up her face for him to kiss . He kisses her on both cheeks and then goes out . In a moment TEDDIE is seen at the window .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I saw the old blighter go .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Come in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Everything all right ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , quite , as far as he 's concerned . He 's going to keep out of the way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Was it beastly ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>No , he made it very easy for me . He 's a nice old thing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>You were rather scared .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>A little . I am still . I do n't know why .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I guessed you were . I thought I 'd come and give you a little moral support . It 's ripping here , is n't it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>It is rather nice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>It 'll be jolly to think of it when I 'm back in the F. M. S .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Are n't you homesick sometimes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , everyone is now and then , you know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>You could have got a job in England if you 'd wanted to , could n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , but I love it out there . England 's ripping to come back to , but I could n't live here now . It 's like a woman you 're desperately in love with as long as you do n't see her , but when you 're with her she maddens you so that you can n't bear her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>What 's wrong with England ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I do n't think anything 's wrong with England . I expect something 's wrong with me . I 've been away too long . England seems to me full of people doing things they do n't want to because other people expect it of them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Is n't that what you call a high degree of civilisation ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>People seem to me so insincere . When you go to parties in London they 're all babbling about art , and you feel that in their hearts they do n't care twopence about it . They read the books that everybody is talking about because they do n't want to be out of it . In the F. M. S . we do n't get very many books , and we read those we have over and over again . They mean so much to us . I do n't think the people over there are half so clever as the people at home , but one gets to know them better . You see , there are so few of us that we have to make the best of one another .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I imagine that frills are not much worn in the F. M. S . It must be a comfort .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>It 's not much good being pretentious where everyone knows exactly who you are and what your income is .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I do n't think you want too much sincerity in society . It would be like an iron girder in a house of cards .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>And then , you know , the place is ripping . You get used to a blue sky and you miss it in England .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>What do you do with yourself all the time ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , one works like blazes . You have to be a pretty hefty fellow to be a planter . And then there 's ripping bathing . You know , it 's lovely , with palm trees all along the beach . And there 's shooting . And now and then we have a little dance to a gramophone .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pretending to tease him .</stage>I think you 've got a young woman out there , Teddie .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Vehemently .</stage>Oh , no !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She is a little taken aback by the earnestness of his disclaimer . There is a moment 's silence , then she recovers herself .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>But you 'll have to marry and settle down one of these days , you know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I want to , but it 's not a thing you can do lightly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know why there more than elsewhere .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>In England if people do n't get on they go their own ways and jog along after a fashion . In a place like that you 're thrown a great deal on your own resources .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Of course .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Lots of girls come out because they think they 're going to have a good time . But if they 're empty-headed , then they 're just faced with their own emptiness and they 're done . If their husbands can afford it they go home and settle down as grass-widows .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I 've met them . They seem to find it a very pleasant occupation .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>It 's rotten for their husbands , though .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>And if the husbands can n't afford it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , then they tipple .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>It 's not a very alluring prospect .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>But if the woman 's the right sort she would n't exchange it for any life in the world . When all 's said and done it 's we who 've made the Empire .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>What sort is the right sort ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>A woman of courage and endurance and sincerity . Of course , it 's hopeless unless she 's in love with her husband .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He is looking at her earnestly and she , raising her eyes , gives him a long look . There is silence between them .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>My house stands on the side of a hill , and the cocoanut trees wind down to the shore . Azaleas grow in my garden , and camellias , and all sorts of ripping flowers . And in front of me is the winding coast line , and then the blue sea .<stage>A pause .</stage>Do you know that I 'm awfully in love with you ?</p>
    </sp>

    <stage>LADY KITTY comes in followed by PORTEOUS , and the BUTLER goes out . LADY KITTY is a gay little lady , with dyed red hair and painted cheeks . She is somewhat outrageously dressed . She never forgets that she has been a pretty woman and she still behaves as if she were twenty-five . LORD PORTEOUS is a very bald , elderly gentleman in loose , rather eccentric clothes . He is snappy and gruff . This is not at all the couple that ELIZABETH expected , and for a moment she stares at them with round , startled eyes . LADY KITTY goes up to her with outstretched hands .</stage>

I think it 's because they 're always playing different parts . Hughie , do you think Arnold takes after me or after his father ? Of course I think he 's the very image of me . Arnold , I think I ought to tell you that I was received into the Catholic Church last winter . I 'd been thinking about it for years , and last time we were at Monte Carlo I met such a nice monsignore . I told him what my difficulties were and he was too wonderful .

     <p>I thought he was a very nice dentist . He told me my teeth would last till I was fifty . He has a Chinese room . It 's so interesting ; while he scrapes your teeth he tells you all about the dear Empress Dowager . Are you interested in China ? I think it 's too wonderful . You know they 've cut off their pigtails . I think it 's such a pity . They were so picturesque .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>How slangy the young women of the present day are ! I suppose the fact that Arnold is a purist leads you to the contrary extravagance .</p>

     <p>You promised to keep away . Why did you come back the moment they arrived ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>Curiosity , my dear child . A surely pardonable curiosity .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>And since then you 've been here all the time . You do n't generally favour us with so much of your company when you 're down at your cottage .</p>

     <p>I 've been excessively amused .</p>

     <p>It has struck me that whenever they started fripping you took a malicious pleasure in goading them on .</p>

     <p>I do n't think there 's much love lost between them now , do you ?</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>No , please do n't . I 'm only staying a minute . We were talking about Lady Kitty just before she arrived .<stage>To ELIZABETH .</stage>Do you remember ? The pale , frail lady in black satin and old lace .</p>
    </sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>Ah , well , he 's always had the reputation of being a humorist and a gentleman .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Did you expect her to be like that , poor dear ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>My dear child , I had n't the vaguest idea . You were asking me the other day what she was like when she ran away . I did n't tell you half . She was so gay and so natural . Who would have thought that animation would turn into such frivolity , and that charming impulsiveness lead to such a ridiculous affectation ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>It rather sets my nerves on edge to hear the way you talk of her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>It 's the truth that sets your nerves on edge , not I .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>You loved her once . Have you no feeling for her at all ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>None . Why should I ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>She 's the mother of your son .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>My dear child , you have a charming nature , as simple , frank , and artless as hers was . Do n't let pure humbug obscure your common sense .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>We have no right to judge . She 's only been here two days . We know nothing about her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>My dear , her soul is as thickly rouged as her face . She has n't an emotion that 's sincere . She 's tinsel . You think I 'm a cruel , cynical old man . Why , when I think of what she was , if I did n't laugh at what she has become I should cry .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>How do you know she would n't be just the same now if she 'd remained your wife ? Do you think your influence would have had such a salutary effect on her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p><stage>Good-humouredly .</stage>I like you when you 're bitter and rather insolent .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>D'you like me enough to answer my question ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>She was only twenty-seven when she went away . She might have become anything . She might have become the woman you expected her to be . There are very few of us who are strong enough to make circumstances serve us . We are the creatures of our environment . She 's a silly , worthless woman because she 's led a silly , worthless life .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Disturbed .</stage>You 're horrible to-day .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>I do n't say it 's I who could have prevented her from becoming this ridiculous caricature of a pretty woman grown old . But life could . Here she would have had the friends fit to her station , and a decent activity , and worthy interests . Ask her what her life has been all these years among divorced women and kept women and the men who consort with them . There is no more lamentable pursuit than a life of pleasure .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>At all events she loved and she loved greatly . I have only pity and affection for her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>And if she loved what d'you think she felt when she saw that she had ruined Hughie ? Look at him . He was tight last night after dinner and tight the night before .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>And she took it as a matter of course . How long do you suppose he 's been getting tight every night ? Do you think he was like that thirty years ago ? Can you imagine that that was a brilliant young man , whom everyone expected to be Prime Minister ? Look at him now . A grumpy sodden old fellow with false teeth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>You have false teeth , too .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>Yes , but damn it all , they fit . She 's ruined him and she knows she 's ruined him .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Am I hurting your feelings ?</p>
    </sp>

     <p>When are you going back to the F. M. S . ?</p>

    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I wonder what he has at the back of his head .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>D'you think he was talking at you ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>He 's as clever as a bagful of monkeys .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>There is a moment 's pause . TEDDIE hesitates a little and when he speaks it is in a different tone . He is grave and somewhat nervous .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>It seems very difficult to get a few minutes alone with you . I wonder if you 've been making it difficult ?</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Why ?</p>
    </sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Frowning .</stage>It makes me feel rather shy and awkward . I 've repeated to myself over and over again exactly what I want to say to you , and now all I 'd prepared seems rather footling .</p>

     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I 'm so afraid I 'm going to cry .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I feel it 's all so tremendously serious and I think we ought to keep emotion out of it . You 're rather emotional , are n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Half smiling and half in tears .</stage>So are you for the matter of that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>That 's why I wanted to have everything I meant to say to you cut and dried . I think it would be awfully unfair if I made love to you and all that sort of thing , and you were carried away . I wrote it all down and thought I 'd send it you as a letter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Why did n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>

I think I 'll have a cigarette .<stage>She watches him in silence while he lights a cigarette .</stage>You see , I 've never been in love with anyone before , not really . It 's knocked me endways .

    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sure that 's very considerate of him , but I do n't happen to have one to smash . I wish I had . It 's the only time in my life I 've wished I were a hell of a swell so that I could chuck it all and show you how much more you are to me than anything else in the world .</p>

     <p>You see , it 's not just because you 're awfully pretty that I love you . I 'd love you just as much if you were old and ugly . It 's you I love , not what you look like . And it 's not only love ; love be blowed ! It 's that I like you so tremendously . I think you 're such a ripping good sort . I just want to be with you .

     <p>I 'll teach you . You do n't know how ripping it is to start out from your camp at dawn and travel through the jungle . And you 're so tired at night and the sky 's all starry . It 's a fair treat . Of course I did n't want to say anything about all that till you 'd decided . I 'd made up my mind to be absolutely practical .</p>

     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>

     <p>But I 'm so interested to see him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I was afraid that you and Lord Porteous must find it embarrassing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , no . Hughie was his greatest friend . They were at Eton and Oxford together . I think your father has improved so much since I saw him last . He was n't good-looking as a young man , but now he 's quite handsome .</p>

     <p>Do you take sugar ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>No . I gave it up during the war .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>So wise of you . It 's so bad for the figure . Besides being patriotic , of course . Is n't it absurd that I should ask my son if he takes sugar or not ? Life is really very quaint . Sad , of course , but oh , so quaint ! Often I lie in bed at night and have a good laugh to myself as I think how quaint life is .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Are you really ? Of course , I was a child when I married your father .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Really . He always told me you were twenty-two .</p>

     <p>Oh , what nonsense ! Why , I was married out of the nursery . I put my hair up for the first time on my wedding-day .</p>

     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Where is Lord Porteous ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>My dear , it sounds too absurd to hear you call him Lord</l>
      <l>Porteous . Why do n't you call him — Uncle Hughie ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>He does n't happen to be my uncle .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>No , but he 's your godfather . You know , I 'm sure you 'll like him when you know him better . I 'm so hoping that you and Elizabeth will come and stay with us in Florence . I simply adore Elizabeth . She 's too beautiful .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Her hair is very pretty .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>It 's not touched up , is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Oh , no .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>I just wondered . It 's rather a coincidence that her hair should be the same colour as mine . I suppose it shows that your father and you are attracted by just the same thing . So interesting , heredity , is n't it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Very .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>Of course , since I joined the Catholic Church I do n't believe in it any more . Darwin and all that sort of thing . Too dreadful . Wicked , you know . Besides , it 's not very good form , is it ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>What are they doing ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>It 's an almost perfect Georgian house and they 've got a lot of dreadful Victorian furniture . I gave them my ideas on the subject , but it 's quite hopeless . They said they were attached to their furniture .</p>

     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>He only said that because he was in a bad temper .</p>

    </sp>

     <p>Really , Kitty , I 'm sick of hearing of the sacrifices you made . I suppose you think I sacrificed nothing . I should have been Prime Minister by now if it had n't been for you .</p>

     <p>They 'd have found you out just as I 've found you out . I 'm sick of hearing that I ruined your career . You never had a career to ruin . Prime Minister ! You have n't the brain . You have n't the character .</p>

     <p>Cheek , push , and a gift of the gab will serve very well instead , you know .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>Besides , in politics it 's not the men that matter . It 's the women at the back of them . I could have made Clive a Cabinet Minister if I 'd wanted to .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>One moment , Arnold . Your father and I are busy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I 'm so sorry .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out into the garden .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>Explain yourself , Clive .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>When you ran away from me , Kitty , I was sore and angry and miserable . But above all I felt a fool .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>Men are so vain .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>But I was a student of history , and presently I reflected that I shared my misfortune with very nearly all the greatest men .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>I 'm a great reader myself . It has always struck me as peculiar .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>The explanation is very simple . Women dislike intelligence , and when they find it in their husbands they revenge themselves on them in the only way they can , by making them — well , what you made me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>It 's ingenious . It may be true .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>I felt I had done my duty by society and I determined to devote the rest of my life to my own entertainment . The House of Commons had always bored me excessively and the scandal of our divorce gave me an opportunity to resign my seat . I have been relieved to find that the country got on perfectly well without me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>But has love never entered your life ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>Tell me frankly , Kitty , do n't you think people make a lot of unnecessary fuss about love ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>It 's the most wonderful thing in the world .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>You 're incorrigible . Do you really think it was worth sacrificing so much for ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>My dear Clive , I do n't mind telling you that if I had my time over again I should be unfaithful to you , but I should not leave you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>For some years I was notoriously the prey of a secret sorrow . But I found so many charming creatures who were anxious to console that in the end it grew rather fatiguing . Out of regard to my health I ceased to frequent the drawing-rooms of Mayfair .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>And since then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>Since then I have allowed myself the luxury of assisting financially a succession of dear little things , in a somewhat humble sphere , between the ages of twenty and twenty-five .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>I cannot understand the infatuation of men for young girls . I think they 're so dull .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>It 's a matter of taste . I love old wine , old friends and old books , but I like young women . On their twenty-fifth birthday I give them a diamond ring and tell them they must no longer waste their youth and beauty on an old fogey like me . We have a most affecting scene , my technique on these occasions is perfect , and then I start all over again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>You 're a wicked old man , Clive .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>That 's what I told you . But , by George ! I 'm a happy one .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>There 's only one course open to me now .</p>

     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>That 's very interesting .</p>

     <p>It must be maddening for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>It is . You are the worst offender . I can n't think why you do n't take the pride that I do in the house . After all , it 's one of the show places in the county .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I 'm afraid you find me very unsatisfactory .</p>

     <p><stage>Good-humouredly .</stage>I do n't know about that . But my two subjects are politics and decoration . I should be a perfect fool if I did n't see that you do n't care two straws about either .</p>

     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>We have n't very much in common , Arnold , have we ?</p>

     <p>I do n't . I blame you for nothing . I have no fault to find with you .</p>

     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I want to be free .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Amused rather than disconcerted .</stage>Do n't be ridiculous , darling . I daresay you 're run down and want a change . I 'll take you over to Paris for a fortnight if you like .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I should n't have spoken to you if I had n't quite made up my mind . We 've been married for three years and I do n't think it 's been a great success . I 'm frankly bored by the life you want me to lead .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Well , if you 'll allow me to say so , the fault is yours . We lead a very distinguished , useful life . We know a lot of extremely nice people .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I 'm quite willing to allow that the fault is mine . But how does that make it any better ? I 'm only twenty-five . If I 've made a mistake I have time to correct it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I can n't bring myself to take you very seriously .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>You see , I do n't love you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Well , I 'm awfully sorry . But you were n't obliged to marry me . You 've made your bed and I 'm afraid you must lie on it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>That 's one of the falsest proverbs in the English language . Why should you lie on the bed you 've made if you do n't want to ? There 's always the floor .</p>

     <p>For goodness ’ sake do n't be funny , Elizabeth .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Come , come , Elizabeth , you must be sensible . You have n't any reason to leave me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Why should you wish to keep a woman tied to you who wants to be free ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I happen to be in love with you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>You might have said that before .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I thought you 'd take it for granted . You can n't expect a man to go on making love to his wife after three years . I 'm very busy . I 'm awfully keen on politics and I 've worked like a dog to make this house a thing of beauty . After all , a man marries to have a home , but also because he does n't want to be bothered with sex and all that sort of thing . I fell in love with you the first time I saw you and I 've been in love ever since .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sorry , but if you 're not in love with a man his love does n't mean very much to you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>It 's so ungrateful . I 've done everything in the world for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>You 've been very kind to me . But you 've asked me to lead a life I do n't like and that I 'm not suited for . I 'm awfully sorry to cause you pain , but now you must let me go .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Nonsense ! I 'm a good deal older than you are and I think I have a little more sense . In your interests as well as in mine I 'm not going to do anything of the sort .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a smile .</stage>How can you prevent me ? You can n't keep me under lock and key .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Please do n't talk to me as if I were a foolish child . You 're my wife and you 're going to remain my wife .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>What sort of a life do you think we should lead ? Do you think there 'd be any more happiness for you than for me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>But what is it precisely that you suggest ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Well , I want you to let me divorce you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Astounded .</stage>Me ? Thank you very much . Are you under the impression I 'm going to sacrifice my career for a whim of yours ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>How will it do that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>My seat 's wobbly enough as it is . Do you think I 'd be able to hold it if I were in a divorce case ? Even if it were a put-up job , as most divorces are nowadays , it would damn me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>It 's rather hard on a woman to be divorced .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p><stage>With sudden suspicion .</stage>What do you mean by that ? Are you in love with some one ?</p>

     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Who ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Teddie Luton .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He is astonished for a moment , then bursts into a laugh .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>My poor child , how can you be so ridiculous ? Why , he has n't a bob . He 's a perfectly commonplace young man . It 's so absurd I can n't even be angry with you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I 've fallen desperately in love with him , Arnold .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Well , you 'd better fall desperately out .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>He wants to marry me .</p>

     <p>I daresay he does . He can go to hell .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>It 's no good talking like that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Is he your lover ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>No , certainly not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>It shows that he 's a mean skunk to take advantage of my hospitality to make love to you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>He 's never even kissed me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I 'd try telling that to the horse marines if I were you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>It 's because I wanted to do nothing shabby that I told you straight out how things were .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>How long have you been thinking of this ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I 've been in love with Teddie ever since I knew him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>And you never thought of me at all , I suppose .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , yes , I did . I was miserable . But I can n't help myself . I wish I loved you , but I do n't .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I recommend you to think very carefully before you do anything foolish .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I have thought very carefully .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>By God ! I do n't know why I do n't give you a sound hiding . I 'm not sure if that would n't be the best thing to bring you to your senses .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Arnold , do n't take it like that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>How do you expect me to take it ? You come to me quite calmly and say : “ I 've had enough of you . We 've been married three years and I think I 'd like to marry somebody else now . Shall I break up your home ? What a bore for you ! Do you mind my divorcing you ? It 'll smash up your career , will it ? What a pity ! ” Oh , no , my girl , I may be a fool , but I 'm not a damned fool .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Teddie is leaving here by the first train to-morrow . I warn you that I mean to join him as soon as he can make the necessary arrangements .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Where is he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know . I suppose he 's in his room .</p>

     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>George !</p>

    <stage>For a moment he walks up and down the room impatiently . ELIZABETH watches him . The FOOTMAN comes in .</stage>

     <speaker>FOOTMAN</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Tell Mr. Luton to come here at once .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Ask Mr. Luton if he would n't mind coming here for a moment .</p>

     <p>That 's my business .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I would n't make a scene if I were you .</p>

      <l>I 'm not going to make a scene .</l>
<stage>They wait in silence .</stage>      <l>Why did you insist on my mother coming here ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>It seemed to me rather absurd to take up the attitude that</l>
      <l>I should be contaminated by her when . . .</l>

     <p><stage>Interrupting .</stage>When you were proposing to do exactly the same thing . Well , now you 've seen her what do you think of her ? Do you think it 's been a success ? Is that the sort of woman a man would like his mother to be ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I 've been ashamed . I 've been so sorry . It all seemed dreadful and horrible . This morning I happened to notice a rose in the garden . It was all overblown and bedraggled . It looked like a painted old woman . And I remembered that I 'd looked at it a day or two ago . It was lovely then , fresh and blooming and fragrant . It may be hideous now , but that does n't take away from the beauty it had once . That was real .</p>

     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>To ELIZABETH .</stage>Did you want me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I sent for you .<stage>TEDDIE looks from ARNOLD to ELIZABETH . He sees that something has happened .</stage>When would it be convenient for you to leave this house ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I was proposing to go to-morrow morning . But I can very well go at once if you like .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I do like .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Very well . Is there anything else you wish to say to me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Do you think it was a very honourable thing to come down here and make love to my wife ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>No , I do n't . I have n't been very happy about it . That 's why I wanted to go away .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Upon my word you 're cool .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I 'm afraid it 's no good saying I 'm sorry and that sort of thing . You know what the situation is .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Is it true that you want to marry Elizabeth ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes . I should like to marry her as soon as ever I can .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Have you thought of me at all ? Has it struck you that you 're destroying my home and breaking up my happiness ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I do n't see how there could be much happiness for you if</l>
      <l>Elizabeth does n't care for you .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Let me tell you that I refuse to have my home broken up by a twopenny-halfpenny adventurer who takes advantage of a foolish woman . I refuse to allow myself to be divorced . I can n't prevent my wife from going off with you if she 's determined to make a damned fool of herself , but this I tell you : nothing will induce me to divorce her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Arnold , that would be monstrous .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>We could force you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>How ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>If we went away together openly you 'd have to bring an action .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Twenty-four hours after you leave this house I shall go down to Brighton with a chorus-girl . And neither you nor I will be able to get a divorce . We 've had enough divorces in our family . And now get out , get out , get out !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>TEDDIE looks uncertainly at ELIZABETH .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>

     <p>I do n't like it , you know . It 's against all my principles .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>My dear Arnold , we all hope that you have before you a distinguished political career . You can n't learn too soon that the most useful thing about a principle is that it can always be sacrificed to expediency .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>But supposing it does n't come off ? Women are incalculable .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>Nonsense ! Men are romantic . A woman will always sacrifice herself if you give her the opportunity . It is her favourite form of self-indulgence .</p>

    <stage>When PORTEOUS comes in LADY KITTY with a very haughty air purses her lips and takes up an illustrated paper . PORTEOUS gives her an irritated look , takes another illustrated paper and sits himself down at the other end of the room . They are not on speaking terms .</stage>

     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , do let me see it ! I love old photographs .</p>

    <stage>He gives her the album , and she , sitting down , puts it on her knees and begins to turn over the pages . He stands over her . LADY KITTY and PORTEOUS take surreptitious glances at one another .</stage>

     <p>Do you think they were more beautiful then than they are now ?</p>

     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>Oh , much . Now you see lots of pretty little things , but very few beautiful women .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>She was the most wonderful thing you ever saw . Dowagers used to jump on chairs in order to get a good look at her when she came into a drawing-room . I was riding with her once , and we had to have the gates of the livery stable closed when she was getting on her horse because the crowd was so great .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>And who 's that ?</p>

     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>That 's Mary Anderson . I wish you could have seen her in “ A</l>
      <l>Winter 's Tale . ” Her beauty just took your breath away . And look !</l>
      <l>There 's Lady Randolph . Bernal Osborne — the wittiest man I ever knew .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I think it 's too sweet . I love their absurd bustles and those tight sleeves .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>What figures they had ! In those days a woman was n't supposed to be as thin as a rail and as flat as a pancake .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , but are n't they laced in ? How could they bear it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>They did n't play golf then , and nonsense like that , you know . They hunted , in a tall hat and a long black habit , and they were very gracious and charitable to the poor in the village .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Did the poor like it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>They had a very thin time if they did n't . When they were in London they drove in the Park every afternoon , and they went to ten-course dinners , where they never met anybody they did n't know . And they had their box at the opera when Patti was singing or Madame Albani .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , what a lovely little thing ! Who on earth is that ?</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>Yes , there was quite a rage at that time for being taken in an artificial snowstorm .</p>

     <lg>
      <l>What a sweet smile , so roguish and frank , and debonair ! Oh ,</l>

     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Lady Kitty !<stage>To LADY KITTY .</stage>Oh , my dear , do look ! It 's too ravishing .<stage>She takes the album over to her impulsively .</stage>Why did n't you tell me you looked like that ? Everybody must have been in love with you .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>LADY KITTY takes the album and looks at it . Then she lets it slip from her hands and covers her face with her hands . She is crying .</stage>
    <stage>In consternation . ] My dear , what 's the matter ? Oh , what have I done ? I 'm so sorry .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>Do n't , do n't talk to me . Leave me alone . It 's stupid of me .</p>

     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p><stage>As they are going , in a whisper .</stage>Did you do that on purpose ?</p>

    <stage>PORTEOUS gets up and goes over to LADY KITTY . He puts his hand on her shoulder . They remain thus for a little while .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PORTEOUS</speaker>
     <p>I 'm afraid I was very rude to you before dinner , Kitty .</p>

     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taking his hand which is on her shoulder .</stage>It does n't matter . I 'm sure I was very exasperating .</p>

     <p>Neither did I .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Of course I know that I 'd never have been Prime Minister .</p>

     <p>Oh , but I should have been so proud of you . Of course you 'd have been Prime Minister .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PORTEOUS</speaker>
     <p>I 'd have given you India , you know . I think it would have been a very popular appointment .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I do n't expect you to have much sympathy for me . Arnold is your son .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>So pitifully little .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I 'm not suited for this sort of existence . Arnold wants me to take what he calls my place in Society . Oh , I get so bored with those parties in London . All those middle-aged painted women , in beautiful clothes , lolloping round ball-rooms with rather old young men . And the endless luncheons where they gossip about so-and-so 's love affairs .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>Are you very much in love with Mr. Luton ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>Will Arnold let you divorce him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>No , he wo n't hear of it . He refuses even to divorce me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>Why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>He thinks a scandal will revive all the old gossip .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , my poor child !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>It can n't be helped . I 'm quite willing to accept the consequences .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>You do n't know what it is to have a man tied to you only by his honour . When married people do n't get on they can separate , but if they 're not married it 's impossible . It 's a tie that only death can sever .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>If Teddie stopped caring for me I should n't want him to stay with me for five minutes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>One says that when one 's sure of a man 's love , but when one is n't any more — oh , it 's so different . In those circumstances one 's got to keep a man 's love . It 's the only thing one has .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I 'm a human being . I can stand on my own feet .</p>

     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>None .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>Then how can you stand on your own feet ? You think I 'm a silly , frivolous woman , but I 've learned something in a bitter school . They can make what laws they like , they can give us the suffrage , but when you come down to bedrock it 's the man who pays the piper who calls the tune . Woman will only be the equal of man when she earns her living in the same way that he does .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>It sounds rather funny to hear you talk like that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>A cook who marries a butler can snap her fingers in his face because she can earn just as much as he can . But a woman in your position and a woman in mine will always be dependent on the men who keep them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I do n't want luxury . You do n't know how sick I am of all this beautiful furniture . These over-decorated houses are like a prison in which I can n't breathe . When I drive about in a Callot frock and a Rolls-Royce I envy the shop-girl in a coat and skirt whom I see jumping on the tailboard of a bus .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>You mean that if need be you could earn your own living ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>What could you be ? A nurse or a typist . It 's nonsense . Luxury saps a woman 's nerve . And when she 's known it once it becomes a necessity .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>That depends on the woman .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>When we 're young we think we 're different from everyone else , but when we grow a little older we discover we 're all very much of a muchness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>You 're very kind to take so much trouble about me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>It breaks my heart to think that you 're going to make the same pitiful mistake that I made .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , do n't say it was that , do n't , do n't .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>Look at me , Elizabeth , and look at Hughie . Do you think it 's been a success ? If I had my time over again do you think I 'd do it again ? Do you think he would ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>You see , you do n't know how much I love Teddie .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>And do you think I did n't love Hughie ? Do you think he did n't love me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sure he did .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , of course in the beginning it was heavenly . We felt so brave and adventurous and we were so much in love . The first two years were wonderful . People cut me , you know , but I did n't mind . I thought love was everything . It is a little uncomfortable when you come upon an old friend and go towards her eagerly , so glad to see her , and are met with an icy stare .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Do you think friends like that are worth having ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps they 're not very sure of themselves . Perhaps they 're honestly shocked . It 's a test one had better not put one 's friends to if one can help it . It 's rather bitter to find how few one has .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>But one has some .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>Yes , they ask you to come and see them when they 're quite certain no one will be there who might object to meeting you . Or else they say to you : “ My dear , you know I 'm devoted to you , and I would n't mind at all , but my girl 's growing up — I 'm sure you understand ; you wo n't think it unkind of me if I do n't ask you to the house ? ”</p>

     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>That does n't seem to me very serious .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>At first I thought it rather a relief , because it threw Hughie and me together more . But you know , men are very funny . Even when they are in love they 're not in love all day long . They want change and recreation .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I 'm not inclined to blame them for that , poor dears .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>Then we settled in Florence . And because we could n't get the society we 'd been used to we became used to the society we could get . Loose women and vicious men . Snobs who liked to patronise people with a handle to their names . Vague Italian Princes who were glad to borrow a few francs from Hughie and seedy countesses who liked to drive with me in the Cascine . And then Hughie began to hanker after his old life . He wanted to go big game shooting , but I dared not let him go . I was afraid he 'd never come back .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>But you knew he loved you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , my dear , what a blessed institution marriage is — for women , and what fools they are to meddle with it ! The Church is so wise to take its stand on the indi — indi —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Solu —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>Bility of marriage . Believe me , it 's no joke when you have to rely only on yourself to keep a man . I could never afford to grow old . My dear , I 'll tell you a secret that I 've never told a living soul .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>What is that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>My hair is not naturally this colour .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Really .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>I touch it up . You would never have guessed , would you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Never .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>Nobody does . My dear , it 's white , prematurely of course , but white . I always think it 's a symbol of my life . Are you interested in symbolism ? I think it 's too wonderful .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I do n't think I know very much about it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>However tired I 've been I 've had to be brilliant and gay . I 've never let Hughie see the aching heart behind my smiling eyes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Amused and touched .</stage>You poor dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>And when I saw he was attracted by some one else the fear and the jealousy that seized me ! You see , I did n't dare make a scene as I should have done if I 'd been married — I had to pretend not to notice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taken aback .</stage>But do you mean to say he fell in love with anyone else ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>Of course he did eventually .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hardly knowing what to say .</stage>You must have been very unhappy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I was , dreadfully . Night after night I sobbed my heart out when Hughie told me he was going to play cards at the club and I knew he was with that odious woman . Of course , it was n't as if there were n't plenty of men who were only too anxious to console me . Men have always been attracted by me , you know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , of course , I can quite understand it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>But I had my self-respect to think of . I felt that whatever Hughie did I would do nothing that I should regret .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>You must be very glad now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , yes . Notwithstanding all my temptations I 've been absolutely faithful to Hughie in spirit .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I do n't think I quite understand what you mean .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>Well , there was a poor Italian boy , young Count Castel Giovanni , who was so desperately in love with me that his mother begged me not to be too cruel . She was afraid he 'd go into a consumption . What could I do ? And then , oh , years later , there was Antonio Melita . He said he 'd shoot himself unless I — well , you understand I could n't let the poor boy shoot himself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>D'you think he really would have shot himself ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , one never knows , you know . Those Italians are so passionate . He was really rather a lamb . He had such beautiful eyes .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>ELIZABETH looks at her for a long time and a certain horror seizes her of this dissolute , painted old woman .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hoarsely .</stage>Oh , but I think that 's — dreadful .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>Are you shocked ? One sacrifices one 's life for love and then one finds that love does n't last . The tragedy of love is n't death or separation . One gets over them . The tragedy of love is indifference .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>ARNOLD comes in .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Can I have a little talk with you , Elizabeth ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Of course .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Shall we go for a stroll in the garden ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>If you like .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>No , stay here . I 'm going out anyway .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Exit LADY KITTY .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I want you to listen to me for a few minutes , Elizabeth . I was so taken aback by what you told me just now that I lost my head . I was rather absurd and I beg your pardon . I said things I regret .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , do n't blame yourself . I 'm sorry that I should have given you occasion to say them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I want to ask you if you 've quite made up your mind to go .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Quite .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Just now I seem to have said all that I did n't want to say and nothing that I did . I 'm stupid and tongue-tied . I never told you how deeply I loved you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Arnold !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Please let me speak now . It 's so very difficult . If I seemed absorbed in politics and the house , and so on , to the exclusion of my interest in you , I 'm dreadfully sorry . I suppose it was absurd of me to think you would take my great love for granted .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>But , Arnold , I 'm not reproaching you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I 'm reproaching myself . I 've been tactless and neglectful . But</l>
      <l>I do ask you to believe that it has n't been because I did n't love you .</l>
      <l>Can you forgive me ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I do n't think that there 's anything to forgive .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>It was n't till to-day when you talked of leaving me that I realised how desperately in love with you I was .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>After three years ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I 'm so proud of you . I admire you so much . When I see you at a party , so fresh and lovely , and everybody wondering at you , I have a sort of little thrill because you 're mine , and afterwards I shall take you home .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Arnold , you 're exaggerating .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I can n't imagine this house without you . Life seems on a sudden all empty and meaningless . Oh , Elizabeth , do n't you love me at all ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>It 's much better to be honest . No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Does n't my love mean anything to you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I 'm very grateful to you . I 'm sorry to cause you pain . What would be the good of my staying with you when I should be wretched all the time ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Do you love that man as much as all that ? Does my unhappiness mean nothing to you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Of course it does . It breaks my heart . You see , I never knew I meant so much to you . I 'm so touched . And I 'm so sorry , Arnold , really sorry . But I can n't help myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Poor child , it 's cruel of me to torture you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Arnold , believe me , I have tried to make the best of it . I 've tried to love you , but I can n't . After all , one either loves or one does n't . Trying is no help . And now I 'm at the end of my tether . I can n't help the consequences — I must do what my whole self yearns for .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>My poor child , I 'm so afraid you 'll be unhappy . I 'm so afraid you 'll regret .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>You must leave me to my fate . I hope you 'll forget me and all the unhappiness I 've caused you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p><stage>There is a pause . ARNOLD walks up and down the room reflectively . He stops and faces her .</stage>If you love this man and want to go to him I 'll do nothing to prevent you . My only wish is to do what is best for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Arnold , that 's awfully kind of you . If I 'm treating you badly at least I want you to know that I 'm grateful for all your kindness to me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>But there 's one favour I should like you to do me . Will you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Arnold , of course I 'll do anything I can .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Teddie has n't very much money . You 've been used to a certain amount of luxury , and I can n't bear to think that you should do without anything you 've had . It would kill me to think that you were suffering any hardship or privation .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , but Teddie can earn enough for our needs . After all , we do n't want much money .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I 'm afraid my mother 's life has n't been very easy , but it 's obvious that the only thing that 's made it possible is that Porteous was rich . I want you to let me make you an allowance of two thousand a year .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , no , I could n't think of it . It 's absurd .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>I beg you to accept it . You do n't know what a difference it will make .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>It 's awfully kind of you , Arnold . It humiliates me to speak about it . Nothing would induce me to take a penny from you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Well , you can n't prevent me from opening an account at my bank in your name . The money shall be paid in every quarter whether you touch it or not , and if you happen to want it , it will be there waiting for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>You overwhelm me , Arnold . There 's only one thing I want you to do for me . I should be very grateful if you would divorce me as soon as you possibly can .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>No , I wo n't do that . But I 'll give you cause to divorce me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>You !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Yes . But of course you 'll have to be very careful for a bit . I 'll put it through as quickly as possible , but I 'm afraid you can n't hope to be free for over six months .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>But , Arnold , your seat and your political career !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Oh , well , my father gave up his seat under similar circumstances . He 's got along very comfortably without politics .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>But they 're your whole life .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>After all one can n't have it both ways . You can n't serve God and Mammon . If you want to do the decent thing you have to be prepared to suffer for it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>But I do n't want you to suffer for it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>At first I rather hesitated at the scandal . But I daresay that was only weakness on my part . Under the circumstances I should have liked to keep out of the Divorce Court if I could .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Arnold , you 're making me absolutely miserable .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>What you said before dinner was quite right . It 's nothing for a man , but it makes so much difference to a woman . Naturally I must think of you first .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>That 's absurd . It 's out of the question . Whatever there 's to pay I must pay it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>It 's not very much I 'm asking you , Elizabeth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I 'm taking everything from you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>It 's the only condition I make . My mind is absolutely made up . I will never divorce you , but I will enable you to divorce me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Arnold , it 's cruel to be so generous .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>It 's not generous at all . It 's the only way I have of showing you how deep and passionate and sincere my love is for you .<stage>There is a silence . He holds out his hand .</stage>Good-night . I have a great deal of work to do before I go to bed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Good-night .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARNOLD</speaker>
     <p>Do you mind if I kiss you ?</p>

     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p><stage>With agony .</stage>Oh , Arnold !</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>You 're alone , Elizabeth ?</p>

     <p>Yes ?</p>

     <p>He wanted to have a talk with me before he went away . He 's waiting for me in the summer house by the tennis court . Would Lord Porteous mind going down and asking him to come here ?</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Certainly . Certainly .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I shall say exactly what I like to you .</p>

     <p>I wo n't be bullied .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Now look here , Elizabeth , you know perfectly well that I 'm in love with you , and I know perfectly well that you 're in love with me . So what are you talking nonsense for ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Her voice breaking .</stage>I can n't say it if you 're cross with me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling very tenderly .</stage>I 'm not cross with you , silly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>It 's harder still when you 're being rather an owl .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a chuckle .</stage>Am I mistaken in thinking you 're not very easy to please ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , it 's monstrous . I was all wrought up and ready to do anything , and now you 've thoroughly put me out . I feel like a great big fat balloon that some one has put a long pin into .<stage>With a sudden look at him .</stage>Have you done it on purpose ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Upon my soul I do n't know what you 're talking about .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I wonder if you 're really much cleverer than I think you are .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taking her hands and making her sit down .</stage>Now tell me exactly what you want to say . By the way , do you want Lady Kitty and Lord Porteous to be here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>Elizabeth asked us to stay .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I do n't mind , bless you . I only thought you might feel rather in the way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Frigidly .</stage>A gentlewoman never feels in the way , Mr. Luton .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Wo n't you call me Teddie ? Everybody does , you know .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>LADY KITTY tries to give him a withering look , but she finds it very difficult to prevent herself from smiling . TEDDIE strokes ELIZABETH 'S hands . She draws them away .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>No , do n't do that . Teddie , it was n't true when I said I did n't love you . Of course I love you . But Arnold loves me , too . I did n't know how much .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>What has he been saying to you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>He 's been very good to me , and so kind . I did n't know he could be so kind . He offered to let me divorce him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>That 's very decent of him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>But do n't you see , it ties my hands . How can I accept such a sacrifice ? I should never forgive myself if I profited by his generosity .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>If another man and I were devilish hungry and there was only one mutton chop between us , and he said , “ You eat it , ” I would n't waste a lot of time arguing . I 'd wolf it before he changed his mind .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>Do n't talk like that . It maddens me . I 'm trying to do the right thing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>You 're not in love with Arnold ; you 're in love with me . It 's idiotic to sacrifice your life for a slushy sentiment .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>After all , I did marry him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Well , you made a mistake . A marriage without love is no marriage at all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I made the mistake . Why should he suffer for it ? If anyone has to suffer it 's only right that I should .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>What sort of a life do you think it would be with him ? When two people are married it 's very difficult for one of them to be unhappy without making the other unhappy too .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I can n't take advantage of his generosity .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I daresay he 'll get a lot of satisfaction out of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>You 're being beastly , Teddie . He was simply wonderful . I never knew he had it in him . He was really noble .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>You are talking rot , Elizabeth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I wonder if you 'd be capable of acting like that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Acting like what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>What would you do if I were married to you and came and told you I loved somebody else and wanted to leave you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>You have very pretty blue eyes , Elizabeth . I 'd black first one and then the other . And after that we 'd see .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>You damned brute !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I 've often thought I was n't quite a gentleman . Had it ever struck you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They look at one another for a while .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>You know , you are taking an unfair advantage of me . I feel as if I came to you quite unsuspectingly and when I was n't looking you kicked me on the shins .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Do n't you think we 'd get on rather well together ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PORTEOUS</speaker>
     <p>Elizabeth 's a fool if she do n't stick to her husband . It 's bad enough for the man , but for the woman — it 's damnable . I hold no brief for Arnold . He plays bridge like a foot . Saving your presence , Kitty , I think he 's a prig .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>Poor dear , his father was at his age . I daresay he 'll grow out of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PORTEOUS</speaker>
     <p>But you stick to him , Elizabeth , stick to him . Man is a gregarious animal . We 're members of a herd . If we break the herd 's laws we suffer for it . And we suffer damnably .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Elizabeth , my dear child , do n't go . It 's not worth it . It 's not worth it . I tell you that , and I 've sacrificed everything to love .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>A pause .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I 'm afraid .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a whisper .</stage>Elizabeth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p>I can n't face it . It 's asking too much of me . Let 's say good-bye to one another , Teddie . It 's the only thing to do . And have pity on me . I 'm giving up all my hope of happiness .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes up to her and looks into her eyes .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TEDDIE</speaker>
     <p>But I was n't offering you happiness . I do n't think my sort of love tends to happiness . I 'm jealous . I 'm not a very easy man to get on with . I 'm often out of temper and irritable . I should be fed to the teeth with you sometimes , and so would you be with me . I daresay we 'd fight like cat and dog , and sometimes we 'd hate each other . Often you 'd be wretched and bored stiff and lonely , and often you 'd be frightfully homesick , and then you 'd regret all you 'd lost . Stupid women would be rude to you because we 'd run away together . And some of them would cut you . I do n't offer you peace and quietness . I offer you unrest and anxiety . I do n't offer you happiness . I offer you love .</p>

     <speaker>ELIZABETH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Stretching out her arms .</stage>You hateful creature , I absolutely adore you !</p>

    <stage>He throws his arms round her and kisses her passionately on the lips .</stage>

     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>Of course the moment he said he 'd give her a black eye I knew it was finished .</p>

     <p>That 's awfully kind of you . As a matter of fact I got it out of the garage . It 's just along the drive .</p>

     <p>Do you mean to say you were going to steal my car ?</p>

     <speaker>PORTEOUS</speaker>
     <p>My dear , I do n't know that in life it matters so much what you do as what you are . No one can learn by the experience of another because no circumstances are quite the same . If we made rather a hash of things perhaps it was because we were rather trivial people . You can do anything in this world if you 're prepared to take the consequences , and consequences depend on character .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Enter CHAMPION-CHENEY , rubbing his hands . He is as pleased as Punch .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>Well , I think I 've settled the hash of that young man .</p>

     <p>Oh !</p>

     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>What is that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>It sounds like a car . I expect it 's your chauffeur taking one of the maids for a joy-ride .</p>

     <speaker>PORTEOUS</speaker>
     <p>Whose hash are you talking about ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Edward Luton 's , my dear Hughie . I told Arnold exactly what to do and he 's done it . What makes a prison ? Why , bars and bolts . Remove them and a prisoner wo n't want to escape . Clever , I flatter myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PORTEOUS</speaker>
     <p>You were always that , Clive , but at the moment you 're obscure .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>I told Arnold to go to Elizabeth and tell her she could have her freedom . I told him to sacrifice himself all along the line . I know what women are . The moment every obstacle was removed to her marriage with Teddie Luton , half the allurement was gone .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY KITTY</speaker>
     <p>Arnold did that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>C. - C</speaker>
     <p>He followed my instructions to the letter . I 've just seen him . She 's shaken . I 'm willing to bet five hundred pounds to a penny that she wo n't bolt . A downy old bird , eh ? Downy 's the word . Downy .</p>
