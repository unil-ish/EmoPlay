   <stage type="setting">
    <stage>The play takes place in MRS. WARREN 'S little living room during the early Victorian period . At the left is a door leading to another part of the house . A door at the back opens into the entrance hall . As the curtain rises , MRS. WARREN , seated in a large chair , is talking to her maid , CLARA .</stage>
   </stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Gossip is malicious , my dear girl , positively malicious . Does n't the Bible say —<stage>The knocker sounds .</stage>There , is n't that the door ?<stage>CLARA starts to go .</stage>Oh , Clara , before you open the door , be sure and dust off the table in the hall and ——</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>CLARA goes out . MRS. WARREN arranges her dress and the little lace cap on her head .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
    <p><stage>From the door</stage>It 's Mrs. Lawty , ma'am .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Oh , the dear soul ! Have her come right in — right in ,</l>
     <l>Clara .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <stage>CLARA goes out . MRS. LAWTY enters .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p>Good afternoon — good afternoon , Mrs. Warren .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Good afternoon , my dear . Do sit down , Mrs. Lawty — do sit down .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p>Oh , thank you . I have just dropped in for a moment . I am on my way to the meeting of the “ Helping Hand Society , ” and as I had to pass this way I just came in to see how you were . I hope I am not interrupting any work you may be doing , my dear .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Oh , dear , no . I was just giving my maid a little lecture ... on gossip .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p>Gossip ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>It is so malicious .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p>Positively unladylike ! One could almost compare a lady who gossips to a ... to a pirate .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>A what , Mrs. Lawty ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p>A pirate . They are sort of wild thieves , you know , and steal things from perfectly innocent people , Mrs. Warren . The South Sea Islands are full of them ... pirates , I mean . Why , I read in our missionary paper , just last week , that one poor man was overtaken by pirates who took away his watch and , I hesitate to say it , his trousers !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>His trousers ! Dreadful !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p>The rest of the story is too indelicate to repeat .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Yes ... yes , some things are often better left unsaid .<stage>Pause .</stage>But one need never be ashamed to speak the truth . What is the rest of the story , Mrs. Lawty ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p>The poor man was forced to come into port with a bad cold in his head ... and in his pajamas !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Oh !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p>And that is why I call a woman who gossips a pirate .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Yes ... yes . Though one can hardly think of any woman unlawfully taking a poor gentleman 's trousers .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p>Hardly . But to steal one 's good name is to take one 's cloak of righteousness , so to speak . And , oh , my dear , few people can face the world without it . The soul is so much more important than the body .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>One should keep both properly clothed .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p>Yes ... though on the South Sea Islands the people wear nothing but grass skirts .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>One could hardly do that in England .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p>Oh , but the people there , in the South Seas , are like little children ... pure of mind . And so it is one of the very first rules of the “ Helping Hand Society ” that no gossip shall pass our lips .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Such a worthy organization . I am sure the ladies of</l>
     <l>Northampton are doing a noble work .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p>Oh , yes , indeed , Mrs. Warren . Why , only last week we sent off a large box of soap to the natives of East Africa and now we are getting a box of napkins and tablecloths ready . We are doing such splendid work for our less fortunate brothers and sisters in a far land .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Brothers and sisters ! One hardly feels that way toward them , Mrs. Lawty . I am told they are quite black .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p>Nevertheless they are Gaud 's creatures .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>My dear , I shall have Clara make you a hot cup of tea . It will rest you .<stage>She calls</stage>Clara ... Clara !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p>Oh , no , thank you ... really . I must n't stop . I always like to get to the society meetings early ... otherwise one misses so much that is interesting .<stage>She rises .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <stage>CLARA appears .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Never mind , Clara .</l>
     <stage>CLARA starts to go .</stage>
     <l>Oh , Clara ,</l>
     <l>Clara ——</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
    <p>Yes , ma'am .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Clara , will you put the water on to boil ? And make the tea rather strong ... but not too strong ... just so .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
    <p>Yes , ma'am .<stage>She goes out .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p>By the way , have you met the new doctor and his wife , Mrs. Warren ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Yes , I have called on Mrs. Hunter .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p><stage>She sits down again</stage>Oh , really ? How interesting .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>But , of course , Betty knows both of them . I must call on Mrs. Hunter again . But I get out so seldom now ... so seldom . I am so afraid to walk on the new ... pavement , I believe they call it . Betty is very fond of them both ... the Hunters , I mean .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p>Quite ... though Mrs. Romney told Mrs. Pickering who told me that the Hunters did not get along well together . It seems she is a Church of England woman while the doctor is the son of a Scotch Presbyterian , so of course ——</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Though I believe they have been married all of five or six years .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p>Oh , really , I did not know that . How interesting ! I must tell Mrs. Romney . But Mrs. Lawer told me that the doctor calls Mrs. Hunter “ Dearest ” ... in public !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Such poor taste .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p>I always suspect a man who is over-demonstrative ... in public .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>But of course one ——</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>BETTY comes running in , her arms full of daisies .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
    <p>Mother dear —— Oh , good afternoon , Mrs. Lawty . See the wonderful flowers Doctor Hunter just gave me .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Doctor Hunter gave you those ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p>Doctor Hunter !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
    <p>Yes , his garden is full of them ! Are n't they beauties ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>But you hardly know him well enough to ——</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
    <p>You see we are getting acquainted . He was on his way to see Mrs. Hallway and ——</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p>Is she ill again ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
    <p>Rheumatism ... not really serious .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p>Oh , really ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
    <p>And as the doctor was coming this way , he walked to the gate with me ... we had a lovely chat . Doctor Hunter is such an interesting conversationalist .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p><stage>Coldly</stage>Walking ! Has n't he a carriage ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
    <p>Oh , yes , but it is such a wonderful day for walking .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p>I daresay that all depends upon with whom one is walking .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Betty , you do n't really mean to tell me that you walked ... walked down a public highway with a strange man !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
    <p>Why , Mother , he is n't a strange man . I know both Doctor and Mrs. Hunter .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>But such a short acquaintance ... and to be walking with him ... walking with him in broad daylight .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
    <p>What would you have me do ? Walk with him after dark ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Oh !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p><stage>When she recovers her breath</stage>I — I really must be going , Mrs. Warren . I must not be late to the meeting , you know .<stage>She pauses .</stage>And perhaps you would rather be alone with your daughter at this time .<stage>She rises .</stage>Good afternoon , Mrs. Warren . Good afternoon .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Good afternoon , Mrs. Lawty .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
    <p>Good-bye .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>MRS. LAWTY goes out . MRS. WARREN waits until the front door slams before she speaks .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p><stage>Much concerned</stage>Betty , how could you ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
    <p>But , Mother ——</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Walking with a man , a man who is married and not on the best terms with his wife , accepting flowers from him , a Presbyterian , unchaperoned . Oh ! It is so unbecoming ... so — so unladylike , not to say indiscreet . Oh ! Why , when I was a girl ——</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
    <p>I know .<stage>She goes close to her mother .</stage>But things have changed so since then , dear .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Not in Northampton , thank heaven . Here , at least , we still keep some of the old propriety . Oh , Betty , this bold indiscretion of yours would have killed your poor , dear father !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
    <p><stage>Turning away</stage>Perhaps that 's what did ... too much propriety .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Did you say something , Betty ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
    <p>I am sorry , dear ... truly sorry if I have caused you any anxiety .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>We must cultivate the doctor 's wife at once . There must be no room for gossip among the ladies of Northampton .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
    <p>Cultivate Mrs. Hunter ? Oh , I would love to . She is a delightful person . Do n't you like her , Mother ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>She seems very nice , but , of course , one must be very careful about strangers .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
    <p>She is very fond of outdoor life , and all that sort of thing . Oh , she is a regular sport !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Betty ! Let me never hear such a remark from you again . Sport ! Am I to understand , then ... am I to understand that Mrs. Hunter is one of those dreadful mannish sort of persons who ——<stage>The knocker sounds .</stage>Oh , dear me ! I wonder who that can be ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
    <p>If you do n't mind , Mother , I shall go up to my room . I want to do a water-color sketch of these flowers while they are still fresh .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Stop here a bit , Betty .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>CLARA enters from the hall .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
    <p>It is Mrs. Romney , ma'am .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Oh , do have her come right in , Clara ... and Clara , serve the tea at once .<stage>CLARA goes out .</stage>Mrs. Romney — oh , dear ... such a bombastic sort of a person , so to speak .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
    <p>She was educated in London , you know .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Yes , poor dear , she has so much to live down . It must be dreadful to have been educated in London ... such a naughty place . Think of the dreadful environment , my dear , London !</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>MRS. ROMNEY enters .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. ROMNEY</speaker>
    <p>Good afternoon , Mrs. Warren . How do you do , Betty , dear ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Do sit down , Mrs. Romney .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. ROMNEY</speaker>
    <p>Did I hear you speaking of London as I came in , Mrs. Warren ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>London ? Speaking of London ? Were we speaking of London ,</l>
     <l>Betty ? Yes , I believe I did say ——</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. ROMNEY</speaker>
    <p>Dear old London ... how I long for it !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>But my dear Mrs. Romney , London surely has n't the ... the refinement of Northampton .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. ROMNEY</speaker>
    <p>Northampton ! Ah ! Why , this place is as far from the world as ... as the South Sea Islands !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Mrs. Romney , how — how can you even think such a thing ? Why , in the South Sea Islands , I am told , the people wear nothing but straw skirts ... and pirates , pirates take things — unmentionable things from innocent travelers . One could not accuse the people of Northampton of such things . Even our shop-keepers are gentlemen compared to those dreadful people who live in the South Seas .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. ROMNEY</speaker>
    <p>The people of the South Sea Islands are at least — interesting .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Perfect savages !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. ROMNEY</speaker>
    <p>But , my dear , all our forefathers were savages , you know ... hitting each other over the head with clubs , hanging from palm trees by their tails , and all that sort of thing .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Oh , dear !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. ROMNEY</speaker>
    <p>And the longer I live in Northampton , my dear , the more I 'm convinced that it was n't so very many generations ago , either .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Oh ... oh ... oh ! Betty , you may go ! You will excuse the dear child , I am sure . She has duties to perform which ——</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. ROMNEY</speaker>
    <p>Oh , yes , certainly .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
    <p><stage>She rises and collects her flowers</stage>Good afternoon , Mrs. Romney . Shall I see you at Mrs. Hunter 's tea Thursday ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. ROMNEY</speaker>
    <p>Yes , dear , charmed .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
    <p>Good-bye .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>MRS. ROMNEY bows . BETTY goes out left . CLARA enters with the tea things .</stage>

    <p>You will have a cup of tea , Mrs. Romney ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. ROMNEY</speaker>
    <p>Yes , thank you so much . So refreshing , nothing like tea for nerves , is there , really ? Half a cup ... I have just come from Mrs. Hunter 's . Both cream and sugar , yes , thank you so much . Such a charming lady , Mrs. Hunter ... perfectly charming , my dear , perfectly charming . So witty , so clever , so vivacious ... but dreadfully jealous .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Jealous ? Jealous of whom ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. ROMNEY</speaker>
    <p>She is very fond of her husband .</p>
   </sp>

    <p><stage>Nervously</stage>Of whom ... of whom is she jealous ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. ROMNEY</speaker>
    <p>No one in particular , at present , I think .</p>

    <p><stage>With a sigh of relief</stage>Oh ——</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. ROMNEY</speaker>
    <p>That is ... oh , is there any cause for her being jealous of any particular person , Mrs. Warren ?</p>

   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. ROMNEY</speaker>
    <p>How uninteresting . The doctor is such a charming gentleman . Dear me , I do hope I will have another attack of indigestion , or something of that sort soon . I am sure Doctor Hunter would be such a splendid physician ... he is so good looking .<stage>She puts down her teacup .</stage>Dear me , I must be going . I am on my way to the meeting of the “ Helping Hand Society ” and ——</p>

   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Yes , Mrs. Lawty has just gone . She dropped in to see me for a moment .</p>

    <speaker>MRS. ROMNEY</speaker>
    <p>Mrs. Lawty ... that one ? I 'm not speaking to her .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Oh , dear , you ... you do n't really mean you have quarrelled ? So unladylike .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. ROMNEY</speaker>
    <p>Ladylike ... ladylike ? Ladylike be damned !</p>

   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. ROMNEY</speaker>
    <p>Mrs. Warren , I beg your pardon . I forgot , for a moment , to whom I was speaking .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>That was quite evident .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. ROMNEY</speaker>
    <p>Quite . But you see , Mrs. Lawty told Mrs. Pickering , who told Mrs. Lawer , who told Lady Bloshire , whose maid told my maid , that Mrs. Lawty said that I dyed my hair ... dyed my hair !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Really ?</p>

    <p>Lovely color , is n't it ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Yes , is n't it ? Mr. Warren , dear man , once told me that the natives of India use tea for dyeing .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. ROMNEY</speaker>
    <p>Hair ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>No ... no ... cloth , I believe , cloth .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. ROMNEY</speaker>
    <p>Oh , how interesting !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>I believe they use the henna berry for dyeing hair in the</l>
     <l>East . I am told it gives a beautiful soft auburn shade .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. ROMNEY</speaker>
    <p>How interesting . Does one procure it from one 's pharmacist ?</p>

    <p>Eh ? Oh , yes , I believe so .</p>

   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>What did you say , Mrs. Romney ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. ROMNEY</speaker>
    <p>I said — I really must be going , my dear . One never seems to realize how fast the time goes when one talks with you . Our little visit has been most interesting ... and most instructive . I do want to stop in for a moment and see Mrs. Hallway before I go to the meeting of the “ Helping Hand . ” Her rheumatism is worse again , poor dear .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Yes , so I heard . I 'm so sorry .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. ROMNEY</speaker>
    <p>Oh , it is not at all serious , just a touch , I believe . Of course she did call in Doctor Hunter . But I really believe it was simply to get acquainted with him more than anything else .<stage>She starts .</stage>Do drop in and see me when you can . Good afternoon , Mrs. Warren .<stage>She goes out .</stage></p>

    <p>Yes , do have her come down and have a cup of tea .</p>

   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. PICKERING</speaker>
    <p>How do you do , Mrs. Warren ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Oh , good afternoon . Do sit down , Mrs. Pickering .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. PICKERING</speaker>
    <p>Oh ... my dear Mrs. Warren , I am so glad to see you looking so well . I thought perhaps — of course there is much sickness in Northampton now .<stage>She sits down .</stage>Much sickness .<stage>Pause .</stage>I just met Mrs. Lawty and she told me that Mrs. Hallway is almost dead with rheumatism ... almost dead . In fact , I think they hardly expect her to live much longer . Of course , Mrs. Lawty did n't say so , but I implied as much from the tone of her voice .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>I heard it was nothing really serious .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. PICKERING</speaker>
    <p>Oh , dear , yes ... very serious . I just had it from Mrs. Lawty , who had it from ... from ... from a most reliable source . Rheumatism is such a painful death , too . Oh , dear , poor soul ... poor soul !<stage>MRS. WARREN hands her a cup of tea .</stage>Thank you so much .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>I believe the new Doctor Hunter is attending her .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. PICKERING</speaker>
    <p>Yes , is n't it too bad ? Mrs. Lawty tells me he is a conversationalist , or something dreadful of that sort . But of course he was educated in London ... and , my dear , London 's standard of morals is not the same as Northampton 's . I was also told that he treats his wife very badly in public , my dear , in public .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>You mean ——</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. PICKERING</speaker>
    <p>My dear Mrs. Warren , I am very sorry to tell you ... but I feel that it is my duty , as wife of your pastor ... to tell you that your daughter Betty has been seen very often ,— that is , at least once — walking with this Doctor Hunter . Also , my dear Mrs. Warren , she accepts presents from him ... flowers and that sort of thing .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Why , Betty hardly knows him !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. PICKERING</speaker>
    <p>That is just it . She hardly knows him ... nor do any of us . Also remember he is a married man , my dear Mrs. Warren , and very good looking ... and I really believe all good-looking people are bad , thoroughly bad .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>I can n't believe that Betty ——</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. PICKERING</speaker>
    <p>Naturally , my dear , naturally ; you are her mother and wish to shield her . But I felt that it was , as I said before , my duty to tell you all I know of the facts of the whole matter .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>You quite alarm me , Mrs. Pickering .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. PICKERING</speaker>
    <p>Young girls , nowadays , are sometimes ... I might say , sometimes indiscreet .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Oh !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. PICKERING</speaker>
    <p>My dear , men are strange beings . Oh , the poor souls that have been lured to their destruction by men . I am always reminded of that beautiful passage in Genesis which says that woman was made after man . And is n't it our dear Mr. Browning who says , “ Second thoughts are always best ” ?<stage>She puts down her teacup .</stage>There , now , I really must be going , Mrs. Warren . I am on my way to the meeting of the “ Helping Hand Society ” and I really must n't be too late . I hope I have not overly alarmed you , Mrs. Warren , but as one of your oldest friends and as the wife of your pastor I feel that I must always do my duty , no matter how painful , when the way lies open before me . I sincerely hope you will not feel that I have been ... been peremptory , so to speak , Mrs. Warren .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>No ... no . It is very kind of you to come to me in this sad moment of trouble .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. PICKERING</speaker>
    <p><stage>Rising</stage>I do hope you will be able to attend the services to-morrow morning . Mr. Pickering has written a beautiful sermon on the evils of gossip ... a beautiful sermon . I feel that it is the best thing he has written in all the forty years of his righteous work . I am sure it will thunder down the ages as his masterpiece . The sentiment , the beautiful English , and even the punctuation ... are really marvelous . Of course , Mr. Pickering and I both realize that there is very little gossip in Northampton ... but it is best to know sin when one encounters it . Good afternoon , Mrs. Warren .</p>
   </sp>

    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p><stage>Weakly</stage>Good afternoon .</p>

    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Did you call Betty ?</p>
   </sp>

    <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
    <p>I knocked at her door , ma'am ... I knocked very loudly , ma'am , but got no answer .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>I am so distressed , Clara . See if she is in the garden . Yes , she must be in the garden .<stage>CLARA starts .</stage>And Clara , do tell her to come in and see me at once . I want to talk to her . It is very important ... oh , most important that I see her at once . Clara .<stage>The knocker sounds .</stage>See who that can be , Clara . Oh , more dreadful news , I fear .<stage>CLARA goes into the hall . MRS. WARREN keeps mumbling to herself :</stage>Most disconcerting ... most dreadfully disconcerting .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>CLARA enters .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
    <p>It is Mrs. Lawer , ma'am .</p>
   </sp>

    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Eh ? What ? Who , did you say ?</p>
   </sp>

    <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
    <p>Mrs. Lawer , ma'am .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Mrs. Lawer ? Oh , do have her come right in , Clara .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>CLARA goes out . MRS. LAWER enters .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWER</speaker>
    <p>Good afternoon , Mrs. Warren , good afternoon .<stage>Breathlessly</stage>How ill , how worried you are looking , Mrs. Warren . Oh , I am so sorry for you ... so very sorry .<stage>She sits down .</stage>I have just seen Mrs. Romney , who had just seen Mrs. Lawty , and had the dreadful news from her . I am so sorry , Mrs. Warren .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>But what ——</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWER</speaker>
    <p>But , of course , we who have known you for all these years will be as silent as the tomb ... you can depend upon us , lean upon us , call upon us . We shall comfort you and be your support in this hour of greatest need .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Why ... why , what do you mean ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWER</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>You really mean to say you do not know about Betty and</l>
     <l>Doctor Hunter ? Oh , dear !</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>But Betty did nothing so very , very improper .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWER</speaker>
    <p>Improper ! Well , of course , we shall not blame poor Betty , she is still very young , but we do blame that wicked Doctor Hunter . Why , he is a married man , my dear ... and oldish . He should have known better .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>But Betty only walked with him .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWER</speaker>
    <p>Only walked with him ? I was told that he sends flowers to Betty ... and flowers have secret meanings . To say the least , they are sentimental . And Mrs. Lawty told Mrs. Romney that she heard Betty say with her own lips that Doctor Hunter was a conversationalist . I believe that means a person with very free ideas about personal matters ... love , and that sort of thing .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>No , indeed ... it simply means that he is a very interesting talker .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWER</speaker>
    <p>That 's just it , Mrs. Warren . What does he find so much to talk about ? I have never met him , but from things I have heard I believe he must be a dreadful person . Most unwholesome , so to speak , to the society — the very refined society of Northampton , where for the last forty years we have all lived in such perfect peace and understanding .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Oh , that this should have come upon me !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWER</speaker>
    <p>Your misfortune is our misfortune , Mrs. Warren . We shall do everything we can to keep this dreadful scandal ——</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Scandal ! Has it — has it gone as far as that ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWER</speaker>
    <p>Let us say , indiscretion . As I was saying , we shall keep it locked in our hearts , no word of it will ever reach foreign ears . Of course I really know very little of the whole affair , but I felt that my first duty was to come to you .</p>

    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Oh , my dear ladies . Do ... do be seated .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>They all sit down quietly . There is a long pause . MRS. PICKERING moves restlessly .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. PICKERING</speaker>
    <p>Mrs. Warren , we have adjourned our meeting of the “ Helping Hand ” until next week in order to come to you ... the poor , dear natives of the South Sea Islands will have to wait another week for their napkins and tablecloths .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. ROMNEY</speaker>
    <p>A very short time ... considering they have not had such necessary luxuries for several centuries .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p>Still , it was with some feeling of ... of regret that we left our work of altruism unfinished , until next week .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. PICKERING</speaker>
    <p>But we feel that our first duty is at home . Yes , we all felt that our duty was toward you , Mrs. Warren , at present .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Ladies , I am overcome with your kindness .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. PICKERING</speaker>
    <p>We shall now consider ... consider ways and means of — of helping you , Mrs. Warren , out of this unspeakable — or , let us say , embarrassing situation .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p>Let us rather call it ... unfortunate situation .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. ROMNEY</speaker>
    <p>No matter what we call it ... let us get on ——</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. PICKERING</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>The facts are these : Mrs. Lawty tells us she heard</l>
     <l>Betty , with her own ears , openly say that the man under consideration ,</l>
     <l>Doctor Hunter , was a revolutionist and ——</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p>I said conversationalist . Though he probably is both .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. ROMNEY</speaker>
    <p>I think she must have meant conventionalist .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. PICKERING</speaker>
    <p>Nevertheless , one is as bad as the other . They all go hand in hand .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>But I believe Betty only said he was a good conversationalist and ——</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p>Anyway , she said he talked a lot about it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. PICKERING</speaker>
    <p>I fear it must be one of those dreadful , sinful new religions one hears so much of nowadays .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. WARREN</speaker>
    <p>Oh !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p>Also , we understand from very reliable sources that Mrs. Hunter is never seen with her husband in public .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. PICKERING</speaker>
    <p>And that he calls her dreadful names .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p>Most suspicious !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. ROMNEY</speaker>
    <p>Oh , I do n't believe a word of it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. LAWTY</speaker>
    <p>Believe it or not , Mrs. Romney ... my information is most reliable .</p>

    <p>Ladies , I am so glad you are all here this afternoon ... so pleased .<stage>The ladies very properly arrange their dresses and bonnets as the curtain falls .</stage>The Touch-Down A comedy in four acts , by Marion Short . 8 males , 6 females , but any number of characters can be introduced in the ensembles . Costumes modern . One interior scene throughout the play . Time , 2-1 / 2 hours . This play , written for the use of clever amateurs , is the story of life in Siddell , a Pennsylvania co-educational college . It deals with the vicissitudes and final triumph of the Siddell Football Eleven , and the humorous and dramatic incidents connected therewith . “ The Touch-Down ” has the true varsity atmosphere , college songs are sung , and the piece is lively and entertaining throughout . High schools will make no mistake in producing this play . We strongly recommend it as a high-class and well-written comedy . Price , 30 Cents . Hurry , Hurry , Hurry A comedy in three acts , by LeRoy Arnold . 5 males , 4 females . One interior scene . Costumes modern . Plays 2-1 / 4 hours . The story is based on the will of an eccentric aunt . It stipulates that her pretty niece must be affianced before she is twenty-one , and married to her fiance within a year , if she is to get her spinster relative 's million . Father has nice notions of honor and fails to tell daughter about the will , so that she may make her choice untrammeled by any other consideration than that of true love . The action all takes place in the evening the midnight of which will see her reach twenty-one . Time is therefore short , and it is hurry , hurry , hurry , if she is to become engaged and thus save her father from impending bankruptcy . The situations are intrinsically funny and the dialogue is sprightly . The characters are natural and unaffected and the action moves with a snap such as should be expected from its title . Price , 30 Cents . The Varsity Coach A three-act play of college life , by Marion Short , specially adapted to performance by amateurs or high school students . 5 males , 6 females , but any number of boys and girls may be introduced in the action of the play . Two settings necessary , a college boy 's room and the university campus . Time , about 2 hours . Like many another college boy , “ Bob ” Selby , an all-round popular college man , becomes possessed of the idea that athletic prowess is more to be desired than scholarship . He is surprised in the midst of a “ spread ” in his room in Regatta week by a visit from his aunt who is putting him through college . Aunt Serena , “ a lady of the old school and the dearest little woman in the whole world , ” has hastened to make this visit to her adored nephew under the mistaken impression that he is about to receive the Fellowes prize for scholarship . Her grief and chagrin when she learns that instead of the prize Robert has received “ a pink card , ” which is equivalent to suspension for poor scholarship , gives a touch of pathos to an otherwise jolly comedy of college life . How the repentant Robert more than redeems himself , carries off honors at the last , and in the end wins Ruth , the faithful little sweetheart of the “ Prom ” and the classroom , makes a story of dramatic interest and brings out very clearly certain phases of modern college life . There are several opportunities for the introduction of college songs and “ stunts . ” Price , 30 Cents .<stage>The Above Are Subject to Royalty When Produced</stage>SAMUEL FRENCH , 28-30 West 38th Street , New York City New and Explicit Descriptive Catalogue Mailed Free on Request The following is a list of changes made to the original .
