    <head type="act">ACT I</head>
    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>A drawing-room at the Hunters ’ , handsomely and artistically furnished . The woodwork and furniture are in the period of Louis XVI . The walls and furniture are covered with yellow brocade , and the curtains are of the same golden material . At the back are two large windows which give out on Fifth Avenue , opposite the Park , the trees of which are seen across the way . At Left is a double doorway , leading into the hall . At Right , opposite , is a door which leads to other rooms , and thence to other parts of the house . In the centre , at back , between the two windows , is the fireplace ; on the mantel are two vases and a clock in dark blue ormolu . There is a white and gold piano on the Right side of the room . The room suggests much wealth , and that it has been done by a professional decorator ; the personal note of taste is lacking .</stage>
     <stage>It is four o'clock in the afternoon . The shades of the windows are drawn down . There are rows and rows of camp-chairs filling the entire room .</stage>
     <stage>The curtain rises slowly . After a moment , JORDAN , the butler , and LEONARD , a footman , enter from the Left and begin to gather together and carry out the camp-chairs . They do this with very serious faces , and take great pains to step softly and to make no noise . They enter a second time for more chairs .</stage>
    </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JORDAN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Whispers to LEONARD .</stage>When are they coming for the chairs ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LEONARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Whispers back .</stage>To-night . Say , it was fine , was n't it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JORDAN</speaker>
     <p>Grand !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They go out with the chairs and immediately reënter for more . They are followed in this time by a lady 's maid , TOMPSON ; she is not a young woman . As she crosses the room she stoops and picks up a faded flower which has fallen from some emblem . She goes to the window at Right , and peeps out . She turns around and looks at the others . They all speak in subdued voices .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TOMPSON</speaker>
     <p>Jordan , what do you think — can we raise the shades now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JORDAN</speaker>
     <p>Yes , of course — after they 've left the house it 's all over as far as we here are concerned .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She raises both shades .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TOMPSON</speaker>
     <p>Phew ! what an odor of flowers !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She opens one of the windows a little .</stage>
    <stage>MARIE , a young , pretty , French woman , enters from the Right .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Will I help you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TOMPSON</speaker>
     <p>Just with this table , thank you , Marie .<stage>They begin to rearrange the room , putting it in its normal condition . They replace the table and put back the ornaments upon it .</stage>Poor Mr. Hunter , and him so fond of mince pie . I shall never forget how that man ate mince pie .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She sighs lugubriously and continues her labor with the room .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LEONARD</speaker>
     <p>I hope as how it 's not going to make any difference with us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JORDAN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pompously .</stage>Of course not ; was n't Mr. Hunter a millionnaire ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TOMPSON</speaker>
     <p>Some millionnaires I 've known turned out poor as Job 's turkey in their coffins !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>What you say ? You tink we shall ‘ ave some of madame 's or ze young ladies ’ dresses ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TOMPSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hopefully .</stage>Perhaps .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I ‘ ave already made my choice . I like ze pale pink of Mees</l>
      <l>Jessie .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LEONARD</speaker>
     <p>Sh ! I heard a carridge .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TOMPSON</speaker>
     <p>Then they 're coming back .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MARIE quickly goes out Right .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JORDAN</speaker>
     <p><stage>To LEONARD , hurriedly , as he quickly goes out Left .</stage>Take them last two chairs !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>LEONARD , with the chairs , follows JORDAN out Left . TOMPSON hastily puts back a last arm-chair to its usual position in the room and goes out Right . MRS. HUNTER enters Left , followed by her three daughters , BLANCHE , JESSICA , and CLARA , and MASTER STERLING , who is a small , attractive child , five years of age . All are in the deepest conventional mourning , MRS. HUNTER in widow 's weeds and CLARA with a heavy , black chiffon veil ; the BOY is also dressed in conventional mourning . As soon as they enter , all four women lift their veils . MRS. HUNTER is a well-preserved woman , with a pretty , rather foolish , and somewhat querulous face . Her figure is the latest mode . BLANCHE STERLING , her oldest daughter , is her antithesis ,— a handsome , dignified woman , young , sincere , and showing , in her attitude to the others and in her own point of view , the warmth of a true , evenly-balanced nature . JESSICA is a typical second child ,— nice , good , self-effacing , sympathetic , unspoiled . CLARA is her opposite ,— spoiled , petulant , pretty , pert , and selfish .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a long sigh .</stage>Oh , I am so glad to be back home and the whole thing over without a hitch !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She sinks with a great sigh of relief into a big chair .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Takes her son to MRS. HUNTER .</stage>Kiss grandmother good-by , and then Leonard will take you home .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>Good-by , dear . Be a good boy . Do n't eat too much candy .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Kisses him carelessly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASTER STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Good-by .<stage>Runs towards the door Left , shouting happily .</stage>Leonard ! Leonard !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Tearfully .</stage>My dears , it was a great success ! Everybody was there !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The three younger women stand and look about the room , as if it were strange to them — as if it were empty . There is a moment 's silence .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Tenderly .</stage>Mother , why do n't you take off your bonnet ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>Take it off for me ; it will be a great relief .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Help me , Jess .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Irritably .</stage>Yes , do something , Jessie . You 've mortified me terribly to-day ! That child has n't shed a tear . People 'll think you did n't love your father .<stage>The two are taking off MRS. HUNTER 'S bonnet . MRS. HUNTER waits for an answer from JESSICA ; none comes .</stage>I never saw any one so heartless !<stage>Tearful again .</stage>And her father adored her . She was one of the things we quarrelled most about !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Over MRS. HUNTER 'S head BLANCHE exchanges a sympathetic look with JESSICA to show she understands .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sure I 've cried enough . I 've cried buckets .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She goes to MRS. HUNTER as BLANCHE and JESSICA take away the bonnet and veil and put them on the piano .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Kissing Clara .</stage>Yes , dear , you are your mother 's own child . And you lose the most by it , too .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Leaning against the side of her mother 's chair , with one arm about her mother .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>Yes , indeed , instead of coming out next month , and having a perfectly lovely winter , I 'll have to mope the whole season , and , if I do n't look out , be a wallflower without ever having been a bud !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Half amused but feeling CLARA 'S remark is perhaps not quite the right thing .</stage>Sh —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>During CLARA 'S speech above , BLANCHE has taken JESSICA in her arms a moment and kissed her tenderly , slowly . They rejoin MRS. HUNTER , BLANCHE wiping her eyes , JESSICA still tearless .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>And think of all the clothes we brought home from Paris last month !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>My dear , do n't think of clothes — think of your poor father ! That street dress of mine will dye very well , and we 'll give the rest to your aunt and cousins .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Mother , do n't you want to go upstairs ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sincerely moved .</stage>Yes , I hate this room now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rising .</stage>Hate this room ! When we 've just had it done ! Louis Kinge !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Louis Quinze , dear ! She means the associations now , mother .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Oh , yes , but that 's weak and foolish , Jessie . No ,</l>
      <l>Blanche —</l>
      <stage>Sitting again .</stage>
      <l>— I 'm too exhausted to move . Ring for tea .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <stage>BLANCHE rings the bell beside the mantel .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Crossing to piano , forgets and starts to play a music-hall song , but MRS. HUNTER stops her .</stage>Oh , yes , tea ! I 'm starved !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>Clara , darling ! As if you could be hungry at such a time !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>JORDAN enters Left .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Tea , Jordan .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JORDAN</speaker>
     <p>Yes , madam .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out Left .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>Girls , everybody in town was there ! I 'm sure even your father himself could n't have complained .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Mother !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>Well , you know he always found fault with my parties being too mixed . He would n't realize I could n't throw over all my old set when I married into his ,— not that I ever acknowledged I was your father 's inferior . I consider my family was just as good as his , only we were Presbyterians !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Mother , dear , take off your gloves .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>I thought I had .<stage>Crying .</stage>I 'm so heartbroken I do n't know what I 'm doing .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Taking off her gloves .</stage>
    <stage>BLANCHE and CLARA comfort their mother .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
     <p>Here 's the tea —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>JORDAN and LEONARD enter with large , silver tray , with tea , cups , and thin bread-and-butter sandwiches . They place them on small tea-table which JESSICA arranges for them .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>I 'm afraid I can n't touch it .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Taking her place behind tea-table and biting eagerly into a sandwich .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Dryly .</stage>Try .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>BLANCHE pours tea for them all , which they take in turn .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Eating .</stage>
      <l>One thing I was furious about ,— did you see the</l>
      <l>Witherspoons here at the house ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>I did .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>The idea ! When I 've never called on them . They are the worst social pushers I 've ever known .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She takes another sandwich .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>Trying to make people think they are on our visiting list ! Using even a funeral to get in !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>But I was glad the Worthings were here , and I thought it sweet of old Mr. Dormer to go even to the cemetery .<stage>Voice breaks a little .</stage>He never goes to balls any more , and , they say , catches cold at the slightest change of temperature .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She takes a third sandwich .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>A great many people loved father .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Irritably .</stage><stage>Spoken very plaintively .</stage>They ought to 've . It was really foolish the way he was always doing something for somebody ! How good these sandwiches are !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
     <p>Shall we have to economize now , mother ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>Of course not ; how dare you suggest such an injustice to your father , and before the flowers are withered on his grave !<stage>Again becoming tearful .</stage><stage>JORDAN enters Left with a small silver tray , heaping full of letters .</stage>Has the new writing paper come ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Who takes the letters and looks through them , giving some to her mother .</stage>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>BLANCHE reads a letter , and passes it to JESSICA .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>Is the black border broad enough ? They said it was the thing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>If you had it any broader , you 'd have to get white ink to write with !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sweetly .</stage>Do n't be impertinent , darling !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Reading another letter .</stage>
    <stage>Enter MISS RUTH HUNTER . She is an unmarried woman between thirty and forty years of age , handsome , distinguished ; an aristocrat , without any pretensions ; simple , unaffected , and direct in her effort to do kindnesses where they are not absolutely undeserved . She enters the room as if she carried with her an atmosphere of pure ozone . This affects all those in it . She is dressed in deep mourning and wears a thick chiffon veil , which she removes as she enters .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Oh ! you 're having tea !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Glad that they are .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taking a second cup .</stage>I thought the children ought to .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Of course they ought and so ought you , if you have n't .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I 've trifled with something .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
     <p>Sit here , Aunt Ruth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Will you have a cup , Aunt Ruth ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Yes , dear , I 'm feeling very hungry .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Sitting on the sofa beside JESSICA and pressing her hand as she does so .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>Hungry ! How can you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Because I 'm not a hypocrite !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Whimpering .</stage>I suppose that 's a slur at me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>If the slipper fits ! But I confess I have n't eaten much for several days ; I could n't touch anything this morning , and I begin to feel exhausted ; I must have food and , thank Heaven , I want it . Thank you .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>To BLANCHE , taking the cup from her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>I think it 's awful , Ruth , and I feel I have a right to say it — I think you owed it to my feelings to have worn a long veil ; people will think you did n't love your brother .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>I can n't remain quiet any longer . George —<stage>She almost breaks down , but she controls herself .</stage>This funeral is enough , with its show and worldliness ! I do n't believe there was a soul in the church you did n't see ! Look at your handkerchief ! Real grief is n't measured by the width of a black border . I 'm ashamed of you , Florence ! I never liked you very much , although I tried to for your husband 's sake , but now I 'm even more ashamed of you . My dear brother is gone , and there need be no further bond between us , but I want you to understand the true reason why , from to-day , I keep away from you . This funeral was revolting to me !— a show spectacle , a social function , and for him who you know hated the very thing .<stage>She stops a moment to control her tears and her anger .</stage>I saw the reporters there , and I heard your message to them , and I contradicted it . I begged them not to use your information , and they were gentlemen and promised me not to . You are , and always have been , a silly , frivolous woman . I do n't doubt you loved your husband as much as you could any man , but it was n't enough for me ; he was worth being adored by the best and noblest woman in the world . I 've stood by all these years , trying with my love and silent sympathy to be some comfort to him — but I saw the disappointment and disillusionment eat away the very hope of happiness out of his heart . I tried to help him by helping you in your foolish ambitions , doing what I could to give my brother 's wife the social position his name entitled her to !</p>

Go , and do it ! and Heaven forgive you for ruining my brother 's life ! I 'm sorry to have said all this before your children . Blanche , you know how dearly I love you , and I hope you have forgiven me by now for my opposition to your marriage .</p>

     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Yes ; I did n't like your husband then , and I did n't believe in him , but I like him better now . And I am going to put all my affairs in his hands . I could n't show — surely — a better proof of confidence and liking than that : to trust him as I did — your father . I hope I shall see much of you and Jessica .

     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>No , he left us at the door when we came back .</p>

     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , yes , he did mention a letter at breakfast , but my thoughts were away . He has been very much worried lately over his affairs ; he does n't confide in me , but I see it . I wish you could advise him , Mr. Mason .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>I cannot advise your husband if he wo n't ask my advice . I do n't think we 'll wait for Mr. Sterling .</p>

    <stage>Gives chair to MRS. HUNTER .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>I suppose you 've come about all the horrid business . Why not just tell us how much our income is , and let all the details go . I really think the details are more than I can bear to-day .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>That can be certainly as you wish ; but I felt — as your business adviser — and besides I promised my old friend , your husband — it was my duty to let you know how matters stand with the least possible delay .</p>

     <p><stage>To MASON .</stage>My good friend , do you mean that literally — that my brother died without leaving any money behind him ?</p>

     <p>For his wife and family ?</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>Yes , tell us the details — every one of them ! You can n't imagine the shock this is to me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>Hunter sent for me two days before he died , and told me things had gone badly with him last year , but it seemed impossible to retrench his expenses .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Are you listening , Florence ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>Yes , of course I am ; your brother was a very extravagant man !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>This year , with his third daughter coming out , there was need of more money than ever . He was harassed nearly to death with financial worries .<stage>RUTH begins to cry softly . MRS. HUNTER gets angrier and angrier .</stage>And finally , in sheer desperation , and trusting to the advice of the Storrings , he risked everything he had with them in the Consolidated Copper . The day after , he was taken ill. You know what happened . The Storrings , Hunter , and others were ruined absolutely ; the next day Hunter died .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Poor George ! Why did n't he come to me ; he must have known that everything I had was his !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>He was too ill when the final blow came to realize it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Angry .</stage>But his life insurance ,— there was a big policy in my name .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>He had been obliged to let that lapse .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>You mean I have n't even my life insurance ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>As I said , there is nothing , except this house , and that is —</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>How can you speak like that ! Surely you know father must have suffered more than we could when he realized he was leaving nothing for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
     <p>Yes , and it was for us too that he lost all . It was our extravagance .</p>

     <p>Yes , typewriting we will consider .</p>

     <p>Jess , you learned enough to teach , did n't you ?— even at that fashionable school your mother sent you to ?</p>

     <p>Oh , yes , I think I could teach .</p>

     <p><stage>With mock humility .</stage>May I speak ?<stage>She waits . All turn to her . A moment 's , silence .</stage>MAY I speak ?</p>

     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes . Go on , Florence ; do n't you see we 're listening ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>I did n't know ! I 've been so completely ignored in this entire conversation . But there is one thing for the girls — the easiest possible way for them to earn their living — which you do n't seem for a moment to have thought of !</p>

    <stage>JESSICA and BLANCHE exchange glances .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>That young Mr. Trotter would be a fine catch for Jess .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
     <p>Who loathes him !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>Do n't be old-fashioned ! He 's very nice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>A little cad , trying to get into society — nice occupation for a man !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
     <p>Mother , you can n't be serious .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>Why would n't he do for me ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>He would ! The very thing !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>We 'll see , darling ; I think Europe is the place for you . I do n't believe all the titles are gobbled up yet .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Jess , I might get you some women friends of mine , to whom you could go mornings and answer their letters .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>I should not allow my daughter to go in that capacity to the house of any woman who had refused to call on her mother , which is the way most of your friends have treated me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Do you realize , Florence , this is a question of bread and butter , a practical suggestion of life , which has nothing whatever to do with the society columns of the daily papers ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>I do not intend that my daughters shall lose their positions because their father has been — what shall we call it — criminally negligent of them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rising .</stage>How dare you ! You are to blame for it all . If you say another word injurious to my brother 's memory , I 'll leave this house and let you starve for all I 'll do for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Aunt Ruth , please , for father 's sake —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>Well , this house is ours , anyway !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>That is what I 've been thinking of . The house is yours . It 's huge . You do n't need it . You must either give it up altogether —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Interrupts .</stage>What ! Leave it ? My house ! Never !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Or — let out floors to one or two friends ,— bachelor friends . Mr. Mason , perhaps —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Interrupts , rising , furious .</stage>Take in boarders !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Who has listened aghast , now rises in outraged dignity ; she stands a moment glaring at BLANCHE , then speaks .</stage>Take —<stage>She chokes .</stage>That is the last straw !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>And she sweeps from the room Right .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>Mama ! Mama !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She goes out after her mother .</stage>
    <stage>The other three women watch the two leave the room , then turn and look at each other .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>We 'll manage somehow , only I think it would be easier for us to discuss all practical matters by ourselves .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>And I want you to understand this , girls ,— I represent your dear father ; half of everything I have is yours , and you must promise me always to come to me for everything .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>STERLING enters suddenly Left .</stage>
    <stage>He is a man of thirty-eight or forty , a singularly attractive personality ; he is handsome and distinguished . His hair is grayer than his years may account for and his manner betrays a nervous system overtaxed and barely under control . At the moment that he enters he is evidently laboring under some especial , and only half-concealed , nervous strain . In spite of his irritability at times with his wife , there is an undercurrent of tenderness which reveals his real love for BLANCHE .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Oh , you 're all here ! Have I missed old Mason ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Yes , but Blanche will tell you what he had to say . I 'm going upstairs to try and pacify your mother . We must n't forget she has a hard time ahead of her .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She goes out Right with JESSICA .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>I suppose Mason came about the will and your father 's affairs ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , you ought to have been here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Irritably .</stage>But I could n't — I told you I could n't !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Do you realize , dear , that you have n't been able to do anything for me for a long time ? Lately , even I hardly ever see you — I stay home night after night alone .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>That 's your own fault , dear ; Ned Warden 's always ready to take you anywhere you like .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With the ghost of a jest .</stage>But do you think it 's quite right for me to take up all Mr . Warden 's time ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Why not , if he likes it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>And do n't you think people will soon talk ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Darling ! People always talk , and who cares !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>It 's months since you showed me any sign of affection , and now when my heart is hungrier than ever for it ,— you know how I loved my father ,— I long for sympathy from you , and you have n't once thought to take me , your wife , in your arms and hold me close and comfort me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sorry , old girl , I 'm really sorry .<stage>Embracing her affectionately .</stage>And surely you know I do n't love any other woman in the world but you .<stage>He kisses her .</stage>It 's only because I 've been terribly worried . I do n't want to bother you with business , but I 've been in an awful hole for money . I tried to make a big coup in Wall Street the other day and only succeeded getting in deeper , and for the last few days I 've been nearly distracted .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Why did n't you tell me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>I thought I 'd get out of it with this Consolidated Copper without worrying you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>You were in that , too ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>How do you mean I , “ too ” ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Mason has just told us father lost everything in it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Aghast .</stage>You do n't mean your father has n't left any money ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Nothing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Forgetting everything but what this means to him .</stage>Nothing ! But I was counting on your share to save me ! What did the damned old fool mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Dick !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Forgive me , I did n't mean to say that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , who are you ! What are you ! You are not the man I thought when I married you ! Every day something new happens to frighten me , to threaten my love for you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>No , no , do n't say that , old girl .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He tries to take her hand .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>What right have you to criticise my father , to curse him — and to-day !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know what I 'm saying , Blanche . Try to forgive me . I would n't have thought of such a thing as his money to-day if it was n't the only thing that can save me from — disgrace .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>His voice sinking almost to a whisper and the man himself sinking into a chair .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Disgrace ! How ? What disgrace ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Going to him .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>I can n't explain it ; you would n't understand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>You must explain it ! Your disgrace is mine .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Alarmed at having said so much , tries to retract a little .</stage>Disgrace was too strong a word — I did n't mean that . I 'm in trouble . I 'm in trouble . Good God , can n't you see it ? And if you love me , why do n't you leave me alone ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>How can I go on loving you without your confidence ?— without ever being suffered to give you any sympathy ? Doll wives are out of fashion , and even if they were n't , I could never be one .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laughing .</stage>My dear , I 'd never accuse you of being stuffed with sawdust .</p>

     <p>Oh , and now you joke about it . Take care , Dick .</p>

     <p>What 's this , a threat ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , if you like to call it that . You 've been putting me more and more completely out of your life ; take care that I do n't finish your work and go the last step .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Seizing her roughly by the wrist .</stage>The last step ! What do you mean by that ?<stage>Holding her hand more roughly .</stage>You dare to be unfaithful to me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>What ! You could think I meant that ! Ugh ! How could you ?</p>

     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Well , what did you mean then ? Eh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Pulling her up close to him , her face close to his . She realizes first by the odor , then by a searching look at his face , that he is partly under the influence of liquor .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With pathetic shame .</stage>Let me go ! I see what 's the matter with you , but the reason is no excuse ; you 've been drinking .</p>
    </sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , only for business . I must have a new business man now to do all that he did for me , and I 'm going to try to make up to you for not having been always your — best friend , by putting my affairs in your hands .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Serious , uneasy , almost frightened .</stage>Aunt Ruth —</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>What , dear ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Nothing .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She gives STERLING a searching , steady look and keeps her eyes upon him , trying to read his real self .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Continues to STERLING .</stage>Mr. Mason is coming to me in the morning , and if you will lunch with me at one , I will then be able to give all the papers over to you .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>STERLING , who up to this time has been almost dumbfounded by this sudden good fortune , now collects himself , and speaks delightedly but with sufficient reserve of his feelings . BLANCHE does not take her eyes from STERLING 'S face .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Aunt Ruth , I thank you from the bottom of my heart , and I will do my best .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quickly .</stage>Promise her , Dick , before me — give her your word of honor — you will be faithful to Aunt Ruth 's trust .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He answers BLANCHE 'S look steadily with a hard gaze of his own .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>His acceptance of my trust is equal to that , Blanche .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>It is of course , is n't it , Dick ?</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Blanche , go to your mother and ask her to see Ned to thank him . I want a minute 's talk with him if you do n't mind .</p>

    <stage>EDWARD WARDEN , though in reality scarcely younger than STERLING , looks at least ten years his junior . He is good-looking , practical , a reasoning being , and self-controlled .

     <p>Yes , please let me thank you all I can ; it wo n't be half what I feel , but I want to know that you know even my silence is full of gratitude for all you 've done for my mother , sisters , and me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Yes , we 're all immensely indebted to you , Ned , old man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>I will tell mother . I know she wants to see you .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She goes out Right .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Speaking with suppressed excitement and uncontrollable gladness , unable to keep it back any longer .</stage>Ned , my wife 's aunt , Miss Hunter , has put all her business in my hands .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Made you her agent ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Yes ! What a godsend ! Hunter did n't leave a cent .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>A moment 's pause of astonishment .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>What do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>It seems he 's been losing for a long time . Everything he had he lost in the copper crash .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>But this is awful ! What will Mrs. Hunter and her two young daughters do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know . I had n't thought of that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>You 'll have to think of it . STERLING . I ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Of course you 'll have to help them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>I can n't ! Look here , I did n't tell you the truth about my affairs last week , when I struck you for that loan .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>You do n't mean to say you were n't straight with me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I only did n't want to frighten you till I 'd got the money ; if you had made me the loan , I 'd have owned up afterwards all right enough .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Owned up what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>That I told you a pack of lies — that I have n't any security !— that I have n't anything but debts .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Strongly .</stage>Good things to borrow on ! Look here , Dick , how long have we been friends ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Since that day at boarding school when you took a licking for something I did .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>What I mean is we were pals at school , chums at college , stanch friends for twenty years .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Hell ! Are we as old as all that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Inseparable friends till the last two years .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>STERLING 'S eyes shift .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>I 've been overworked lately , and everything has gone wrong !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Comes up to him , and speaks firmly but still friendly .</stage>You yourself have gone wrong !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>On the defensive .</stage>What do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Why did you take your business out of my hands ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>The law did n't pay me enough . I thought I 'd try a little amateur stockbroking .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Smiling insincerely .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>You did n't want me to know what you were doing !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Rats !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>You did n't want me to know what funds — whose funds — you were using — misusing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Ugly .</stage>What !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Whose money you were gambling with !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Have you been spying on me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Your wife 's money !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Well , she 's my wife , and you do n't know what you 're talking about !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He turns from him and picks up a book from the table upside down and pretends to read it .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>You stole from me once when you were a boy !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>No ! I did n't !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Throwing the book down .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>You lie ! Do you hear me ? You lie !<stage>He waits a second . STERLING does nothing .</stage>I was never sure till to-day ! I fought against ever thinking it , believing my suspicions were an injustice to you , but little things were always disappearing out of my rooms — finally , even money . Lately , that old suspicion has come back with a fuller force , and to-day it became a certainty .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>How to-day ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Because if it were n't true , you 'd have knocked me down just now when I called you first a thief and twice a liar !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He stands squarely facing him . STERLING stands facing him also , surprised , taken off his guard .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Oh , come , you 're joking !<stage>WARDEN makes an angry exclamation .</stage>Why 're you telling me all this now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Because I want you to be careful . I want you to know some one is watching you ! Some one who knows what you 've come to ! Some one who knows you can n't resist temptation ! Some one who knows money not yours has stuck to your fingers !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>You mind your own business .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>I 'll mind yours if it 's necessary to protect people who are dear to me !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>STERLING looks at him with a sudden suspicion .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Insinuatingly .</stage>I did n't know you were particularly attached to Mrs. Hunter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>I 'm not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Or to her two unmarried daughters !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Nor am I !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>With whispered intensity .</stage>By God , if you are in love with my wife !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>If you thought that out loud , I 'd knock you down !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Huh ! you talk as if you thought I were a coward !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>No , not a physical coward — I 've seen you do too many plucky things — but a moral coward — yes , you are one !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Straight to him , standing close and looking him squarely in the eyes .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Wavering .</stage>Oh , you 're too damned preachy !</p>

    <stage>MRS. HUNTER enters Right with CLARA . MRS. HUNTER shakes hands with WARDEN silently , happy in the feeling that she is in great affliction , and satisfied with the appearance and impression she is making . She carries her handkerchief , with its black border , ready in her hand . CLARA has silently shaken hands with WARDEN , after her mother . She afterwards goes to STERLING and hands him several of the letters of condolence . She then goes to the window at Left , pulling aside the curtain , and stands looking out , rather bored , wishing she could go out and take a walk .</stage>

     <p><stage>Not looking at CLARA .</stage>Charming ! We 'll go upstairs and come down again ; I do n't think it nice to be found here as if we were expecting visitors .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They go out Right .</stage>
    <stage>JORDAN steps into the room to announce the visitors , and seeing no one there , bows as the three pass him .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JORDAN</speaker>
     <p>The ladies will be down at once .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out Right .</stage>
    <stage>The three turn , looking about the room with curiosity , as if the funeral might have made some difference in the house .</stage>
    <stage>MISS SILLERTON is a handsome , attractive woman , most fashionably dressed and perfectly conventional in character and intelligence . MISS GODESBY is a little slow , more assertive , sharper of tongue , more acutely intelligent , and equally smartly dressed . She has still a remnant of real , sincere feeling buried under a cynical mask which her life in a fast set has developed for her self-preservation . TROTTER is a foolish young person , meaning well enough according to his lights , which are not of the biggest and brightest .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>Classy house altogether !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS SILLERTON</speaker>
     <p>Mrs. Hunter went to the most expensive decorator in town , and told him , no matter what it cost , to go ahead and do his worst !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They all laugh and seat themselves comfortably .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>Say ! The youngest daughter is a good looker — very classy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS SILLERTON</speaker>
     <p>That 's the one we told you about , the one we want you to marry .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Yes , with your money and her cleverness , she 'll rubber neck you into the smartest push in town !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>You 've promised I shall know the whole classy lot before spring .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>So you will if you do as we tell you . But you must n't let society see that you know you 're getting in ; nothing pleases society so much as to think you 're a blatant idiot . It makes everybody feel you 're their equal — that 's why you get in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>I 've got a coach and can drive four-in-hand . I 've an automobile drag , and the biggest private yacht in the world building . I 'm going to have the most expensive house in Long Island , where the oysters come from , and I 've bought a lot in Newport twice as big as the swellest fellow 's there . I 've got a house in London and a flat in Paris , and I make money fly . I think I ought to be a cinch as a classy success .</p>
    </sp>

    </sp>
    <stage>Sitting .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>A good thing for you , for he would never have stood for you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>He 'd have had to — or do without me as a son-in-law — I would n't marry the Venus of Milo if her father did n't think I was good enough . I 'm no Dodo bird !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>It 's up to you now , Trotter ! Go in and win .</p>

     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Only stay a minute or two , Trotty — we 're doing our best for you , but we must look out for ourselves , too , and we 've come here to-day on business .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS SILLERTON</speaker>
     <p>How 'll we ever get the subject on to clothes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Humph ! Do you think you can talk five minutes with Mrs. Hunter and not hit that topic ? It 's a bull 's eye !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>I do n't see where I 'm going to come into this classy conversation .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>You see , Trotty , they brought over piles of clothes from Europe this year , and we want to get hold of them before any one else has a chance — get ‘ em cheap before they have an idea anybody else 'll buy them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>Who buy what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS SILLERTON</speaker>
     <p>We — buy their winter clothes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>For Heaven 's sake !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Laugh , you silly ! I heard the Reed girls planning to come to-morrow . They did n't dare come to-day . Those girls have n't any sand ! They 're always getting left .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>You two are Dodo birds !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>I say , Eleanor , you 're such a lobster about prices and Mrs. Hunter 's no idiot , we 'd better agree on some sort of a signal ! Listen ! if you like a gown very much , ask the price , then say to me , “ My dear , your hat pin is coming out . ” And if I think it 's a bargain , I 'll say , “ So it is , thank you ; wo n't you put it in for me ? ” And if I think Mrs. Hunter 's trying to stick you , I 'll say “ No , it is n't ; it 's always like that . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS SILLERTON</speaker>
     <p>All right .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MRS. HUNTER and CLARA enter Right . The manner of MISS SILLERTON and MISS GODESBY changes immediately . They speak with rather subdued voices , in the tone of conventional sympathy which is usually adopted on such occasions . MRS. HUNTER also assumes the manner of a martyr to grief . CLARA is casual and hard .</stage>

     <p>Not at all .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>But every one has been most kind . Lady Hopeton sent me a beautiful long letter to-day .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>And I 'm glad to find you looking so well . Black suits you !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She exchanges a knowing glance with MISS SILLERTON .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I do n't know , Julia ; I 've always thought black very trying for me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , no ! every one 's saying just the reverse !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>But — I suppose clothes do n't interest you , Mr. Trotter ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>Oh , yes , they do , out of sight !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>Well , I wish you could have seen the beautiful things we brought over with us !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS SILLERTON</speaker>
     <p>Julia and I were just speaking about it , and pitying you from the bottom of our hearts .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MISS SILLERTON and MISS GODESBY again exchange surreptitious glances .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>Every one 's been most kind .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>There is an awkward pause for a moment , no one knowing quite what to say . Both MISS GODESBY and MISS SILLERTON have started the conversation in the direction of clothing and are fearful of the topic being changed . As the pause becomes embarrassing , they look helplessly from one to the other , and all five , suddenly and at once , make an ineffectual effort to say something — or nothing . Out of the general confusion MRS. HUNTER comes to the front , mistress of the situation . ] Are you going to stay in New York this winter , Mr. Trotter ?</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I 'm negotiating for one of the biggest classy building plots on upper Fifth Avenue .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p><stage>To MISS GODESBY .</stage>I saw in the papers you were at the dance last night .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MISS GODESBY nods and motions surreptitiously to TROTTER to go . He , however , does n't understand .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p><stage>With interest again in life .</stage>Oh , were you ? What did you wear ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , dowdy old things . I have n't bought my winter frocks yet .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She repeats this casually as if to herself .</stage>
    <stage>MISS SILLERTON motions to TROTTER to go , but he has forgotten and still does n't understand .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>What ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>You warned us not to let you forget your engagement !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>What engagement ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS SILLERTON</speaker>
     <p>How do we know ! we only know you said you had to go !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>Never said so ! Oh !<stage>As it dawns upon him .</stage>Oh , yes ! of course .<stage>He rises .</stage>Very sorry — must be off . Only dropped in — er — that is , came in to express my respectful sympathy .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Shaking hands with MRS. HUNTER .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Who rises .</stage>I hope you will come and see us again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>Do ! It 'll be a godsend ! We 'll be dull as ditchwater here this winter !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>I shall be delighted to call again . Good-by .<stage>He bows to Clara . In his embarrassment he starts to shake hands all over again , but , realizing his mistake , laughs nervously .</stage>Oh , I have already .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS SILLERTON</speaker>
     <p>Good-by , Trotter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Do n't forget we 're booked with you at Sherry 's .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>Whose treat ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Oh ! Yours , of course —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>I say , why can n't I stay ? I wo n't interfere .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>Oh , do stay , Mr. Trotter !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , do stay !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Suggesting by her tone that he must n't dare to remain .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>Good !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>TROTTER remains , and they all settle themselves again for a long stay .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>By the way , you were speaking just now of your winter frocks . It occurs to me — of course I do n't know as I really want to dispose of them , but — er —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She hesitates purposely .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Oh , would you ?</l>
      <stage>Rising , she takes a chair nearer to MRS. HUNTER .</stage>
      <l>You dear thing !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>The dresses are no use to us now , and when we 're out of mourning — they 'll be out of style . You could wear Jess ’ things perfectly , Julia .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS SILLERTON</speaker>
     <p>And even something of yours could be made over for us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>But I 'm so much older than you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS SILLERTON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Thoughtlessly .</stage>Yes , but you never dress appropriately to your age .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laughing delightedly .</stage>That 's pretty good !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS SILLERTON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Saves herself .</stage>You know what I mean , you always look so youthful , you can n't dress any older .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rising .</stage>Clara , dear , go upstairs and have Tompson bring down my Worth dress and Jess ’ Doucet and your Paquin .<stage>She goes with CLARA to the door , Right , and then whispers to her .</stage>If you remember , do n't tell what we paid — we ought to get nearly double out of these girls — and warn Tompson not to be surprised at anything she hears .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MISS GODESBY and MISS SILLERTON exchange glances . CLARA goes out Right .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>It seems as if I had no further interest in clothes , anyway .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Do n't say that . Every one I 've seen this afternoon is wildly enthusiastic over your mourning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>Well , I went straight to Madame O'Hoolihan and gave her carte blank !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>I would n't like to be the ice man when your bill comes in !— and clothes abroad are so much cheaper .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Thoughtlessly .</stage>Oh , half !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quickly .</stage>You see you 'll be doing us a really great favor letting us have some of your things !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Realizing her nearly fatal error .</stage>Oh ! Oh , yes — but — er — I must say that we found prices while in Paris this year rather atrocious !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>CLARA reënters Right .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sighs .</stage>O dear ! It breaks my heart not to wear my ball dress , my dear Julia ; it was designed specially for me . I told Marie to put it on , mama ; my clothes fit her perfectly , and I thought it would show so much better what it is .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>Here they are .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Rises as TOMPSON enters Right .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TOMPSON</speaker>
     <p>Mrs. Hunter 's reception gown .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Displaying it .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>Oh , this is a beauty !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She takes the costume and drapes it over a chair . MISS GODESBY and MISS SILLERTON come closer to examine .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>Tompson .—<stage>Taking her to one side , whispers .</stage>— I forget ; do you remember what I paid for this dress ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TOMPSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Whispers back .</stage>One hundred and sixty dollars , madam .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Oh , yes . Do n't say anything .</l>
      <stage>Returning to the others .</stage>
      <l>Do you like it ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS SILLERTON</speaker>
     <lg>
<stage>At the same time . MISS GODESBY . Immensely . It 's great ! }</stage>      <l>Perfectly lovely ! }</l>
      <l>}</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hesitates .</stage>I forget just what I paid for it , but I believe it was two hundred dollars .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>CLARA half exclaims in astonishment , but on being pinched surreptitiously on the arm by MRS. HUNTER she grasps the situation and starts in to do her share .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>Oh , no , mama ! I 'm sure it was more than that !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>Well , perhaps it was two — twenty or two — twenty-five .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>That 's cheap , is n't it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Shut up .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>TOMPSON 'S face is always a perfect blank , showing no expression or surprise ; she has lived with MRS. HUNTER for many years and “ knows her business . ”</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a very different tone of voice , influenced by the big price .</stage>Of course , I see it 's made of the best material . But it is n't my color .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>It 's the very latest shade .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I know ; but I think as you said a little while ago , perhaps it is a trifle too old for me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>I might let you have it for a little less ; say one hundred and eighty .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Thank you very much . I 'll think it over .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS SILLERTON</speaker>
     <p>What 's the other ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>This is a dinner dress of Jess ’ .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Holding it up to her own waist .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS SILLERTON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Carried away by the dress .</stage>Oh , lovely ,— perfectly charming ,— an adorable gown !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MISS GODESBY pulls her arm and tries to make her less enthusiastic .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p><stage>To CLARA and MRS. HUNTER .</stage>Excuse me .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She takes MISS SILLERTON to one side and whispers in her ear .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS SILLERTON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Aloud .</stage>I can n't help it . I 'm crazy about the dress !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Meanwhile MRS. HUNTER and TOMPSON have whispered together .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>They said themselves this was the most successful frock they turned out this autumn .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS SILLERTON</speaker>
     <p>And how much is this one ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Very quickly , trying not to speak consciously .</stage>This was two hundred and seventy-five .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>CLARA bites her lips in surprise and winks visibly to TOMPSON , who gives no sign and is otherwise imperturbable .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS SILLERTON</speaker>
     <p><stage>To MISS GODESBY , looking hard at her .</stage>My dear , your hat pin is coming out !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking hard at her .</stage>No , it is n't ; it 's always like that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS SILLERTON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Going closer to her , whispers .</stage>Which does that mean ? I forget !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>It 's a gouge !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS SILLERTON</speaker>
     <p>I can n't help it ; I can n't resist .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS HUNTER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Whispers to CLARA .</stage>She 's going to take it ; I wish I 'd asked more .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS SILLERTON</speaker>
     <p>Mrs. Hunter , I 'll take the dinner dress ! I 'm crazy about it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>I 'm glad to have you have it ; I 'm glad to be able to do you , in a way , a favor .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MARIE at this moment enters dressed in the most exquisite ball dress of the very latest fashion and looks extremely lovely .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>Here 's mine ! I could cry to think I 'll never wear it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Voila , madame !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>A short silence , while the women sit down and drink in the gown .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS SILLERTON</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a subdued voice of awed admiration .</stage>Beautiful !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Great !</p>

     <p><stage>To MISS GODESBY .</stage>I 'm stuck on the girl ; introduce me . She 's out of sight !</p>

    <stage>MRS. HUNTER sighs long and loud ,— a sigh of appreciation and admiration . MARIE stands in the centre of the stage facing the audience .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>May we see her back ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>Her entire back , if she turns around !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Oui , madame .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She turns her back — the dress is cut extremely in the back .</stage>

     <speaker>MISS SILLERTON</speaker>
     <p>Oh !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>The way everything is made this year .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>I 'm afraid my back is rather full of bones .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>They told us in Paris , bones were coming in !<stage>She takes a large American beauty rose from a vase on the piano and slips it down MARIE 'S back so that the dress seems much less décolleté .</stage>There , never too late to mend !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>How much is this one ?</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>I would n't part with it for a penny less . I could n't afford to .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The manners and voices of all become a little strained .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>That is of course your affair .</p>

     <p>Forgive my intruding so soon again , but did Mr. Mason leave a letter case of Mr. Hunter 's here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>BLANCHE begins looking for the case .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>I have n't seen it ; I 'll ask the servants to look . Excuse me , I 'm quite tired out ; we 've been receiving a long visit of condolence .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She goes out , Right , with CLARA , who links her arm in her mother 's .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Finding the case , which has fallen beneath the table .</stage>Here it is . Dear old pocket-book —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Her voice breaks on the last word , and turning her face away to hide her tears , she hands him the well-worn letter case .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Mrs. Sterling , I 'm glad they left us alone , because Mr. Mason said he had n't been able to manage it — to see you alone — and yet he wanted you only to examine these . They are private papers of Mr. Hunter ; he thought they ought not to be destroyed without being read , and yet he hesitated to read them . We thought that duty devolved best upon you .<stage>He hands back the letter case .</stage>Shall I wait and take back the case to Mr. Mason with the papers you wish him to have ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , no , I will send them ; I must n't keep you while I read them . I 'm always taking more of your time than I ought .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Speaks with sincerity , but without any suggestion of love-making .</stage>But never as much as I want to give you ! Do n't forget , Mrs. Sterling , what you promised me at your wedding ,— that your husband 's best man should be your best friend .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>And nobody knows what it means to a woman , even a happily married woman like me —<stage>This is spoken with a slight effort , as if she is persuading herself that she is a happily married woman .</stage>— to have an honest friend like you . It 's those people who have failed that say there is no such thing as a platonic friendship .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>We 'll prove them wrong .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>We will . Good-by , and thank you .</p>

     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>And thank you !<stage>Starting to go , he turns .</stage>Shall I bring that Russian pianist around to play for you some day next week ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Do — I want some music .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Only let me know what day .<stage>He goes out Left . BLANCHE sits by the table and opens the case . She looks first at a memoranda and reads what is on the outside .</stage>A business memoranda . Lists of bonds .<stage>She opens and looks at the next paper only a second , and then closes it .</stage>This , Mr. Mason will understand better than I .<stage>She puts it back in the pocket case . She finds a photograph in the case .</stage>My picture !—<stage>She looks for others , but finds none .</stage>— and only mine ! Oh , father !...<stage>She wipes away tears from her eyes so as to see the picture , which is an old one .</stage>Father , I returned your love .<stage>She reads on the back of photograph .</stage>“ Blanche , my darling daughter , at fourteen years of age ! ” That 's mine ! that 's my own !<stage>And she puts the picture away separately . She takes up a small packet of very old love-letters tied with faded old pink tape .</stage>Old letters from mother ; they must be her love-letters . She shall have them ,— they may soften her .<stage>She takes up a slip of paper and reads on the outside .</stage>This is something for Mason , too .<stage>She puts it back in the case . She takes up a sealed envelope , blank .</stage>Nothing on it , and sealed .<stage>She looks at it a moment , thinking .</stage>Father , did you want this opened ? If you did n't , why not have destroyed it ? Ah ! I need n't be afraid ; you had nothing to hide from the world .<stage>Tearing it open , she reads .</stage>“ I have discovered my son-in-law , Richard Sterling , in irregular business dealing . He is not honest . I will watch him as long as I live ; but when you read this , Mason , keep your eye upon him for my daughter 's sake . He has been warned by me — he may never trip again , and her happiness lies in ignorance . ”<stage>She starts , and looks about her to make sure she is alone . She then sits staring ahead for a few seconds ; then she speaks .</stage>My boy 's father dishonest ! Disgrace — he owned it — threatening my boy ! It must n't come ! It must n't ! I 'll watch now .<stage>She goes to the fireplace , tearing the paper as she crosses the room , she burns the letter ; then she gathers up the other letters and the pocket case .</stage>He must give me his word of honor over Richard 's little bed to-night that he will do nothing to ever make the boy ashamed of bearing his father 's name !<stage>She watches to see that every piece of the paper burns , as</stage>THE CURTAIN FALLS</p>

     <stage>Christmas Eve ; fourteen months later ; the dining room of the Hunters ’ house , which is now lived in jointly by the STERLINGS and MRS. HUNTER and her daughters . It is a dark wainscoted room , with curtains of crimson brocade . It is decorated with laurel roping , mistletoe , and holly , for Christmas . It is the end of a successful dinner party , fourteen happy and more or less congenial persons being seated at a table , as follows : WARDEN , RUTH , MASON , CLARA , TROTTER , MRS. HUNTER , BLANCHE , STERLING , MISS SILLERTON , MR. GODESBY , JESSICA , DOCTOR STEINHART , and MISS GODESBY . The room is dark on all sides , only a subdued light being shed on the table by two large , full candelabra with red shaded candles . As the curtain rises the bare backs of the three women nearest the footlights gleam out white . Candied fruit and other sweetmeats are being passed by four men servants , including JORDAN and LEONARD .</stage>

     <p><stage>To MISS GODESBY .</stage>Julia , do tell me how Mr. Tomlins takes his wife 's divorce ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>He takes it with a grain of salt !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>But is n't he going to bring a counter suit ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>I hope not . I am an old-fashioned woman and do n't believe in divorce !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Really ! But then you 're not married !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS SILLERTON</speaker>
     <p>What is the reason for so much divorce nowadays ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Marriage is the principal one .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>I do n't believe in divorce , either .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS SILLERTON</speaker>
     <p>My dear , no woman married to as handsome a man as Mr. Sterling would .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>You people are all out of date ! More people get divorced nowadays than get married .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Too many people do — that 's the trouble . I meant what I said when I was married — “ for better , for worse , till death us do part . ” — What is the opera Monday ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>Something of Wagner 's . He 's a Dodo bird ! Bores me to death ! Not catchy enough music for me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>You 'd adore him if you went to Bayreuth . Which was that opera , Clara , we heard at Bayreuth last summer ? Was it Faust or Lohengrin ! They play those two so much here I 'm always getting them mixed !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS SILLERTON</speaker>
     <p>Wagner did n't write Faust !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>Did n't he ? I thought he had ; he 's written so many operas the last few seasons !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>I like Tannhäuser , because as soon as you hear the “ twinkle , twinkle , little stars ” song , you can cheer up and think of your wraps and fur boots .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>My favorite operas are San Toy and the Roger Brothers , though I saw Florodora thirty-six times !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Mother would have gone with you every one of those thirty-six</l>
      <l>Florodora times . She 's not really fond of music .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>Not fond of music ! Did n't I have an opera box for four years ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>Why does n't Conried make some arrangement with Weber and Fields and introduce their chorus into Faust and Carmen ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. STEINHART</speaker>
     <p>Great idea !<stage>To MISS GODESBY .</stage>Did you get a lot of jolly presents ?</p>

     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Give it to me for cigarettes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>It 's too long for cigarettes . Then I had something that 's either a mouchoir or a handkerchief case , or for neckties , or shaving papers , or something or other .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I know , I got one of those , too .</p>

    </sp>
    <stage>They go out at back .</stage>
    <stage>As they pass out , JORDAN stands by the doorway holding the curtains back . The other three men stand stiffly at the Right . As MASON and RUTH go out , the SERVANTS relax and exchange glances , each giving a little laugh out loud , except JORDAN . During the following dialogue they empty the table preparatory to arranging the room for the Christmas tree .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JORDAN</speaker>
     <p>Sh ! A very dull dinner , not an interesting word spoke .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FIRST FOOTMAN</speaker>
     <p>The widder seemed chipper like !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LEONARD</speaker>
     <p>And did you get on to the old lady 's rig-out ; mourning do n't hang very heavy on her shoulders .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>One chair is moved back .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JORDAN</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>To FIRST FOOTMAN .</stage>
      <l>Get the coffee .</l>
      <stage>He goes out Right . To LEONARD .</stage>
      <l>Get the smoking lay-out !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <stage>LEONARD goes out Right and brings back a silver tray laden with cigarettes , cigar boxes , and a burning alcohol lamp .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LEONARD</speaker>
     <p>If you ask me , I think she 's going to put a bit more on the matrimonial mare if she gets the chance .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JORDAN</speaker>
     <p>It 's none of your business . You 're Mrs. Sterling 's servant now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LEONARD</speaker>
     <p>Good thing , too ; it was a happy day for us when they moved in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FIRST FOOTMAN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Reënters with the coffee .</stage>Say , did you see how that young feller over there<stage>Motioning to the lower right-hand corner of the table .</stage>shovelled the food in ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LEONARD</speaker>
     <p>And the way he poured down the liquid — regular hog ! My arm 's tired a-filling of his glass .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>And he drinks a glass of champagne which has been left untouched by a guest .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JORDAN</speaker>
     <p>He ai n't nobody ; he has n't any money ; he was just asked to fill up . He 's one of these yere singing chaps what 's asked to pass the time after dinner with a song or two gratis . This dinner 'll last him for food for a week ! Their manners suddenly change as the men reënter and take seats about the two ends of the table . STERLING , MASON , and DOCTOR down Left form one group . The other men are in a group between the window and the other end . On entering STERLING speaks .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Jordan , for heaven 's sake , give us something to see by ! You can n't tell which end of your cigar to light in this confounded woman 's candle-light . If I had my way , I 'd have candelabras made of Welsbachs !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>Bright idea , Sterling .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>STERLING , laughing , joins his group , who laugh gently with him . JORDAN turns on the electric light . The servants pass the coffee , liqueurs , and the cigars and cigarettes . Meanwhile the following dialogue takes place , the men beginning to talk at once on their entrance .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Mason , I 'd like to ask your honest opinion on something if you 'll give it me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>Certainly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>This Hudson Electric Company .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. STEINHART</speaker>
     <p>Oh ! Dropped fearfully to-day .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>But that can happen easily with the best thing . To-morrow —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Interrupting .</stage>To-morrow it will drop to its very bottom !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>I do n't believe it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. STEINHART</speaker>
     <p>Surely , Mr. Mason , the men who floated that are too clever to ruin themselves ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>They 're out of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Out of it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>They got out last week quietly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>But —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>Mark my words , the day after to-morrow there 'll be several foolish people ruined , and not one of the promoters of that company will lose a penny !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>I do n't believe it !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The crowd at the other end of the table , who have been listening to a tale from TROTTER , laugh heartily .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Delighted with his success .</stage>I 'm no Dodo bird !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>WARDEN leaves this group casually and joins the other .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p><stage>To STERLING .</stage>Do n't tell me you 're in it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Ugly .</stage>Yes , I am in it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>Not much ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Yes , much !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Much what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Oh , nothing ; we were just discussing stocks .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>And up there they 're discussing Jeffreys and Fitzsimmons .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>Listen , Dick , after a lifelong experience in Wall Street , I defy any broker to produce one customer who can show a profit after three consecutive years of speculation .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Oh , you 're too conservative ; nothing venture , nothing have . Excuse me , I think Jeffreys and Fitzsimmons more amusing topics . Come along .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>STERLING and DR. STEINHART join the other group Right .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p><stage>To WARDEN .</stage>You 're Sterling 's broker .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>No , not for over a year .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>Then you can n't tell me how deep he is in this Hudson Electric swindle ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Is he in it at all ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>Yes , he says , deep .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>I suspected it yesterday .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>But what with — his wife 's money ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>That went fourteen months ago . I put him on his feet then , gave him some tips that enabled him to take this house with her mother , so that with his regular law business he ought to have done very well , but his living could not leave one cent over to speculate with .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p><stage>To himself .</stage>Good God !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>I know what you 're afraid of .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>No !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Yes . The reason I 'm no longer his broker is he was ashamed to let me know about his dealings .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>But you do n't mean you think he 'd actually steal !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>His aunt 's money ? Why not ? He did his wife 's !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>Does he handle any one else 's affairs ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>I know he takes care of that Godesby woman 's property .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>And she would n't hold her tongue if a crash came !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Not for a minute ! Is Miss Hunter suspicious ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>Yes . Does Sterling realize that to-morrow he will most probably be a ruined cheat ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Very likely .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>If he made up his mind to-night it was all up with him , he might do — what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Run away with whatever money he has left , or kill himself . I do n't know if he 's enough of a coward for that or not . There 's one hold on him — he loves his wife .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>Which will make him all the more ashamed of discovery . Do you believe she suspects ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Not a bit . She loves him too dearly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>Can we do anything ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Nothing but watch him closely till the people go . Then force him to make a clean breast of it , so we can all know where we stand ; how we can best protect his aunt from ruin and his wife and boy from public disgrace .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>He is watching us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>He knows I know him ; we must be careful . He 's coming toward us .<stage>He then speaks in a different tone , but no louder .</stage>You 're certain of the trustworthiness of your information ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>Absolutely . Every man left in that concern will be ruined before the ‘ Change closes after to-morrow .<stage>STERLING has joined them in time to hear the end of MASON 'S speech . MASON continues .</stage>I am telling Warden what I told you about the Hudson Electric Company .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>Ca n't you talk of something pleasanter ?</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Oh , nothing . I forgot to send them up to her , that 's all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>But she says she sent three times .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>One time too late to get into the vault ; and the other , her letter was mislaid — I mean not given to me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>You have n't broken your word to me ?</p>

     <p>What if I had ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>I would let the law take its course .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>You must love me very little .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>I live with you . First you robbed me of my respect for you ; then you dried up my heart with neglect .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>And our boy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Your blood runs in his veins ; your shame and disgrace would be a fearful warning to him . It might kill me ; but never mind , if it saved him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Oh , well , I have n't broken my word ! So you need n't worry . I 've been honest enough .</p>
    </sp>

     <p><stage>With a long sigh of relief .</stage>Oh ! I hope so !</p>

     <p><stage>Appearing in doorway at back .</stage>The men are in the drawing-room — shall we come here ?</p>

     <p>Yes , sir ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Go up to my library at the top of the house , get a railroad guide you will find there , and bring it down and put it on the table in the hall just outside the drawing-room door .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LEONARD</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Then go to my room and pack my bag and dressing case . Do you understand ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LEONARD</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir .</p>

    <stage>The women are heard singing “ Follow the Man from Cook 's , ” and gradually coming nearer .</stage>

     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Be quick , and say nothing to any one .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LEONARD</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out quickly Right . STERLING goes up stage and stands beside the door at back as the women dance in , singing “ Follow the Man from Cook 's . ” They are led by CLARA , with MRS. HUNTER on the end . BLANCHE and RUTH follow alone , not dancing . The others dance around the chairs and CLARA jumps on and off one of them ; this stops the rest , who balk at it . STERLING goes out at back . The SERVANTS enter Right .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>I do n't care for this dinner party at all . The women are all the time being chased away from the men ! I prefer being with Mr. Trotter . Do n't you , mama ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS SILLERTON</speaker>
     <p>He does n't seem able to give a dinner party any more without you to chaperone , Mrs. Hunter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Mother , how can you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I do n't know as it 's chaperoning ! I like Mr. Trotter very much .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS SILLERTON</speaker>
     <p>But he 's such a little cad . I tried to give him a lift , but he was too heavy for me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>Oh , well , you ought just to pretend it 's the money in his pocket makes him so heavy ; then you 'd find him dead easy .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Meanwhile the SERVANTS have arranged the table , taken out the extra leaves and made it square , and left the room . They now reënter , bringing in a gorgeously decorated and lighted Christmas tree . There is at once a loud chorus of delighted approval from the women . The SERVANTS place the tree in the centre of the table . The women who are sitting rise and come near to examine the tree .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>What a beautiful tree , Blanche !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>The boy is to have it to-morrow morning — it 's really his tree !<stage>TOMPSON brings in a large basket containing seven small stockings and six small boys ’ socks — very small stockings and very small socks . They are made of bright and different colors and are stuffed into absurd , bulgy shapes .</stage>There 's a name on each one . Come along now !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Taking out a little sock . The women crowd around the basket and each hangs a sock on the tree , MISS GODESBY and CLARA standing on chairs .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Reading the name on her sock .</stage>Oh ! mine 's for Mr. Mason . What 's in it , Blanche ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>I really can n't tell you . I asked the clerk where I bought it what it was for , and he said he did n't know ; it was a “ Christmas present . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Laughing .</stage>
      <l>Oh , I know the kind ! Mine 's for Howard</l>
      <l>Godesby . What 's his present ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>A silver golf marker .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>But he does n't play golf !</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Well , he ought to ; it 'll keep him young .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>It will be all right , anyway , Julia ! You can give it away to some one next Christmas .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS SILLERTON</speaker>
     <p>What 's in Mr. Trotter 's ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , that present has almost been my death ! Men are so hard to find things for ! I had put in a gold pencil for his key chain , but to-night while we were eating our oysters , I saw him show a beauty that his mother had given him this morning ! So I whispered to Jordan between the soup and fish to change Mr. Ryder 's name to Mr. Trotter 's stocking , and put Mr. Trotter 's name on the one that had a cigarette case in it . I sneaked a message down to Dick on my dinner card — was it all right ?— and he sent back word during the game that Trotter only smoked cigars ; so before the ices were passed I shuffled Mr. Trotter 's and Mr. Mason 's names ,— I 'd given Mason the cigar case ,— and just as Jordan signalled to me the transfer had been successfully effected , I heard Trotter casually observe he 'd been obliged to give up smoking entirely — doctor 's orders !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They laugh punctiliously , rather bored by BLANCHE 'S long account .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>Is n't the tree stunning ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Getting down from her chair .</stage>It makes the table look like one of Mr. Trotter 's “ informal little dinners . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>They say he has one of those men who arrange shop windows decorate his dinner table for him !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>The only time I ever dined with him I was really ashamed to go home with my dinner favor — it was so gorgeous ! And there were such big bunches of violets in the finger bowls there was n't room for your little finger .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>You never saw such a lot of decoration ! The game have ribbon garters on their legs , and even the raw oysters wear corsage bouquets !<stage>To MRS. HUNTER .</stage>I hope you do n't mind what we 're saying , Mrs. Hunter ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Offended .</stage>I must say I do mind very much .—<stage>A pause .</stage>— because —<stage>A second pause .</stage>— well , I am going to marry Mr. Trotter —<stage>All , not believing her , laugh merrily .</stage>You are all very rude !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Not on the level ! Not Trotter !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS SILLERTON</speaker>
     <p>Not really !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>No , no , of course not !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She rings bell .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>But I am ! And I thought here at my daughter 's table , among my own friends<stage>I was allowed to name the guests to-night</stage>, I could count on good wishes and congratulations .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>There is a dead silence .</stage>
    <stage>The musicians , a band of Neapolitan players , enter and take their places in a recess at Left .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>To the musicians .</stage>You may play .<stage>To JORDAN , who has brought in the Neapolitans .</stage>We are ready , Jordan .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>JORDAN goes out at back .</stage>
    <stage>RUTH goes to BLANCHE .</stage>
    <stage>The guitars and mandolins begin a popular song .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p><stage>To MRS. HUNTER .</stage>Oh , well , Mrs. Hunter , we were only codding ! There 's lots of good in Trotter , and I 'm sure you 'll bring it out . Good luck !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Shaking her hand .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p><stage>To BLANCHE , aside .</stage>You wo n't allow this !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Certainly not .<stage>BLANCHE crosses to her mother and they go to one side together ; BLANCHE speaks in a lowered voice .</stage>You 've amazed and shocked me ! I will not tolerate such a thing ; we 'll talk it over to-night .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She leaves her and returns to her guests , MRS. HUNTER standing where she is left , biting her lips and almost crying with rage and mortification .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Before the musicians , to BLANCHE as she joins her .</stage>I 'm crazy about these men , Mrs. Sterling ; they play so awfully well — especially that one with the lovely legs !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>JORDAN pulls aside the curtains at back and all the men reënter except WARDEN . They all join hands and dance around the tree , singing with the musicians ; they break , and go up to a side table , where everything to drink is displayed . WARDEN enters at this moment and motions to MASON and leads him down stage .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>There was a railway guide in the hall — that 's what he went there for ; he 's going to run away to-night .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>How 'll we prevent it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>First , we must break up this party !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>How ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>I have n't quite thought yet . Go back to the others ; send Jordan to me ; do n't lose sight of Dick . Jordan !<stage>He takes him aside .</stage>I want you to go out of this room for a minute , pretend to go upstairs , then come back and tell Mrs. Sterling , loud enough for the others to hear you , that Master Richard is very ill , and say the maid is frightened .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JORDAN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hesitating .</stage>But —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quickly and firmly .</stage>Do as I tell you . I am responsible for whatever happens .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>JORDAN goes out at back . The men and women are laughing and talking about the sideboard .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Come now , everybody ! Let 's have the presents . Dick , you know you are to be Santa Claus .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>STERLING looks nervously at his watch .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Just a minute , dear ! Ned !<stage>Takes WARDEN to one side . The women move about the tree , hunting for their own names on the stockings on the table at the foot of the tree .</stage>Ned , I 've been suddenly called out of town on business — must catch the eleven-twenty train . I do n't want to break up the party , so you empty the tree , and when the time comes for me to go , I 'll slip out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>And when your guests go ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Oh , then you can explain for me .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>JORDAN enters at back .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JORDAN</speaker>
     <p><stage>To BLANCHE .</stage>Beg pardon , madam , but Master Richard is very ill .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Alarmed .</stage>Richard !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JORDAN</speaker>
     <p>Yes , ma'am , and Droves is very frightened , ma'am .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Richard ill ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>All give exclamations of surprise and regret and sympathy .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>My little boy ill ? Excuse me , I must go to him .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She hurries out at back . RUTH speaks to the musicians , who stop playing .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Moved .</stage>My boy ill — why , I can n't — I can n't —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>“ Ca n't ” what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>How can I go away ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Surely you wo n't let business take you away from your boy who may be dying .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>No ! I wo n't go ! I 'll face it out ! I can n't leave my boy like this —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coming to STERLING .</stage>I 'm going to take these women away ; tell Blanche not to give them a thought . Their evening up to now has been charming .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>During RUTH 'S speech , WARDEN has spoken aside with MASON .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Aside to MASON .</stage>Do n't let Miss Hunter go .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p><stage>To the other guests .</stage>Come to the drawing-room .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>I was crazy to see what was in my stocking .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>All pass out talking , expressing conventional sympathy on account of RICHARD , but evidently resenting the breaking up of the party . STERLING and WARDEN are left alone in the room . STERLING moves to go up to back ; WARDEN interrupts him .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>To STERLING .</stage>Where are you going ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>To my boy and my wife .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Wait a minute ; I want to speak to you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Speak to me later ; I can n't wait now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Off stage , at back , excitedly .</stage>Jordan !<stage>She enters , excited , half hysterical .</stage>Jordan ! Where is Jordan ? It was a lie ! What did he mean ? Richard is sleeping sweetly . The maid knows nothing of being alarmed ! Where is Jordan ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She starts to go toward the door Right .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Stops her .</stage>Mrs. Sterling , he had nothing to do with it ! I told Jordan to say what he said .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>BLANCHE turns and looks at WARDEN in astonishment .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Stunned and at once suspicious .</stage>What ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>But —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Forgive me for so cruelly alarming you ; it was the only way I could think of for getting rid at once of your guests !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Angry .</stage>You 'll interfere once too often in the affairs of this house .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Indignant .</stage>But what excuse can you make , Mr . Warden ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Will you be so good as to ask Miss Hunter and Mr. Mason to come here ? They will explain what I have done , partly , and your husband will tell you the rest when you come back .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>STERLING sneers aloud .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>I do n't understand , I do n't understand .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She goes out at back .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Well , I do understand , at least enough .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Good ! That spares me a very disagreeable speech .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>No , it does n't ! Come out with it ! What is it you want ? What is it you 've found out ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>From betraying a trust , you 've come , in less than two years , to an outright embezzlement .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Speak out — give us facts !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>You 've stolen your aunt 's fortune .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Prove that !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>It 's her money that 's lost in the Hudson Electric Company ! STERLING . PROVE IT !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Easy enough , to-morrow .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>You 've got to excuse your action to-night or be kicked out of my house !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Strong .</stage>Is n't what I say the truth ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Equally strong .</stage>No ! And now get out !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looks at his watch .</stage>I 'll not leave this house till it 's too late for you to take that eleven-twenty .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>More ugly .</stage>Yes , you will and mighty —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>No , I 'll not !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He is interrupted by the entrance of BLANCHE , RUTH , and MASON .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>To BLANCHE .</stage>I hope you forgive me now —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pathetically .</stage>You did right ; I thank you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Heartbroken .</stage>Blanche — without hearing a word from me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>No , I 've come now to hear what you have to say .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>A deep-toned clock strikes eleven . STERLING , at the second stroke , takes out his watch with a hurried movement .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quickly .</stage>Eleven o'clock .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>I wish Warden to leave the room .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Firmly .</stage>And I wish him to stay .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>A short pause .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Well , of what am I accused ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Nobody wants to accuse you . We want you to make a clean breast of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Do n't you talk to me ; let my wife do the talking if you want me to answer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Sit down , Aunt Ruth .<stage>RUTH sits by the table , WARDEN stands at back . STERLING stands at Right and BLANCHE and MASON sit near the centre .</stage>Aunt Ruth asks you to give her a true account of her trust in you . Mr. Mason is here as her friend and my father 's .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>I have n't said I betrayed her trust . I told her she should have the bonds she wants to-morrow .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>But will she ? That 's what I want to know . I ask you if you have n't her bonds , to tell us here now ,— tell us , who have been and must be still the best friends , perhaps the only friends , you can have . Tell us where we all stand — are we the only ones to suffer or are there others who will perhaps be less generous in their treatment of you ? Tell us now while there is time perhaps to save us from public scandal , from the disgrace which would stamp your wife as the wife of a thief , and send your boy out into the world the son of a convict cheat .<stage>She breaks down , but in a moment controls herself . There is no answer . STERLING sinks into a chair , his arms on the table , his head on his arms . A moment 's silence .</stage>You love me — I know that . I appeal to your love ; let your love of me persuade you to do what I ask . I ask it for your sake and for mine ! Tell us here the truth now — it will spare me much to-morrow , perhaps — me whom you love — for love of me —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>In an agony .</stage>I 'm afraid I 'll lose you —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>No , I 'll promise to stand by you if you 'll only tell us all the truth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a low , shamed voice .</stage>I 'll tell you , but not now — not before all these others .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>BLANCHE looks up questioningly to MASON . MASON shakes his head .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>It must be now , Dick .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>No ! no ! I can n't look you in the face and tell it ! Let me tell it to you alone , later , in the dark .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>BLANCHE looks up questioningly to MASON . He shakes his head .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>It must be now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>No , no , I 'm too ashamed , I can n't face you ; in the dark I 'll make a clean breast of it — let me tell you in the dark .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>WARDEN moves and puts his hand on the electric-light button beside the doorway at back .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>In the DARK , then , tell it !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He presses the button and all the lights go out . The stage is in complete darkness ; only the voices are heard from the different places in which the actors are last seen .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quickly .</stage>Remember , to help you to help ourselves , we must know everything . Go on .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>It began fourteen months ago , after Ned Warden put me on my feet ; I got a little ahead — why not get way ahead ? There were plenty of men around me making their fortunes ! I wanted to equal them — climb as high as they ; it seemed easy enough for them , and luck had begun to come my way . We 're all climbers of some sort in this world . I was a climber after wealth and everything it brings —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He stops a moment .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Her voice comes throbbing with pathetic emotion through the darkness .</stage>And I after happiness and all it brings .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Deeply moved , his voice trembles for a moment , but only for a moment .</stage>Do n't , Blanche , or I can n't finish . Well , I borrowed on some of Aunt Ruth 's bonds and speculated — I made a hundred thousand in a week ! I put back the bonds . But it had been so easy ! I could see those bonds grinning at me through the iron side of the vault box . They seemed to smile and beckon , to beg me to take them out into the air again ! They grew to be like living things to me , servants of mine to get me gold — and finally I determined to make one bigger coup than ever ! I took Aunt Ruth 's bonds out and all the money available in my trust , and put it all into this new company ! It seemed so safe . I stood to be a prince among the richest ! And , for a day or so , I 've known nothing short of a miracle could save me from being wanted by the police ! To-night I gave up even the miracle . That 's all . It 's no use saying I 'm sorry .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>A moment 's pause .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>Have others suffered besides Miss Hunter ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>There is some money of Aunt Ruth 's left — stock I could n't transfer . But I used the money of others — Miss Godesby and Ryder 's .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>Miss Ruth , a large part of your fortune is gone , used unlawfully by this man . Will you resort to the law ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Very quietly .</stage>No !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a voice broken with emotion and gratitude .</stage>Aunt Ruth !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>We can n't hope Miss Godesby and Ryder will be as lenient ! You must go to them in the morning — tell them everything , put yourself at their mercy , ask for time and their silence .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Never ! I could n't do it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>It is the only honorable way out of your dishonorable action — the least you can do !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Confess to their faces , and probably to no good ? Eat the dust at their feet , and most likely be clapped into prison for it ? No , thank you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Suppose I went to them ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>You ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>No ! Why should you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Yes ! Why not ? They might keep silent for her !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>I would do it for my boy 's sake . Yes , I 'll go .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Yes ! You go , Blanche .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>No , you sha n't go — you sha n't humiliate yourself in his place !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>Certainly not ; and if your husband is willing , we are not willing ! He must go .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>But if he wo n't ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>He must !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>You must demand his going , Blanche , and I demand it , too , as something due to me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Very well . I demand it . Will you go ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>A moment 's silence .</stage>

     <p>Why do n't you speak ?<stage>He presses the electric button and all the lights come on . STERLING is at the doorway at back , about to steal out . There is an exclamation aloud from all of surprise and disgust . The clock strikes the quarter ; WARDEN catches hold of STERLING 'S arm .</stage>What 's your hurry , Dick ? There goes the quarter hour ; you could never catch the eleven-twenty .</p>

     <stage>At “ The Hermitage , ” on the Bronx River , the next afternoon . The house is on the Left , and on the Right and at the back are the green lattice arches . Snow lies thick everywhere , on the benches at the Right and on the little iron table beside it , on the swing between two trees at the Right , in the red boxes of dead shrubs , on the rocks and dried grass of a “ rookery ” in the centre , and on the branches of the trees . CLARA comes out from the house , followed by TROTTER .</stage>
    </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>Come on and let mama rest awhile — naturally she 's excited and tired out , being married so suddenly and away from home .<stage>She stops beside the swing , taking hold of its side rope with her hand .</stage>It is n't every mother who can elope without her oldest child 's consent and have her youngest daughter for a bridesmaid .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Laughing .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>I hope Mrs. Sterling will forgive me . Perhaps she will when she sees how my money can help your mother and me to get right in with all the smarties !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>Oh , do n't you be too sure about your getting in ; it is n't as easy as the papers say ! But , anyway , that would n't make any difference to Blanche . She was never a climber like mama and me . I suppose that 's why she is asked to all sorts of houses through Aunt Ruth that would n't let mama and me even leave our cards on the butler !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>I thought your mother could go anywhere she liked .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>Oh , no , she could n't ! if she made you think that , it was only a jolly ! Blanche is the only one of us who really went everywhere . Come along , “ Poppa , ” give me a swing ! I have n't had one for years !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She sweeps off the snow from the seat of the swing with her hand .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>Your mother certainly did represent —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sitting in the swing .</stage>Oh , well , now do n't blame mama ! She could n't help herself ; she always thought you dreadfully handsome ! Swing me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>I do n't care , anyway . I 'm deucedly proud of your mother ,— I mean of my wife ,— and I 'd just as lief throw up the whole society business and go off and live happily by ourselves .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>O dear ! I think mama would find that awfully dull . Go on , swing me !<stage>TROTTER swings her .</stage>Of course , you 'll find mama a little different when you see her all the time . You really wo n't see much more of her , though , than you do now . She does n't get up till noon , and has her masseuse for an hour every morning , her manicure and her mental science visitor every other day , and her face steamed three times a week ! She has to lie down a lot , too , but you must n't mind that ; you must remember she is n't our age !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Swings her .</stage>She suits me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>That 's just what I feel ! You 'll take care of her , and me , too , all our lives , and that 's what makes me so happy . I 'm full of plans ! We 'll go abroad soon and stay two years .<stage>He has stopped swinging her .</stage>Go on , swing me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Holding the swing still .</stage>Say ! if you think you are going to run me and the whole family , you 're a Dodo bird ! Remember that you 're my daughter ; you must wait a little if you want to be a mother-in-law .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Sleigh-bells are heard in the distance , coming nearer .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>Good gracious ! If you ask me , I think mama has got her hands full . What 's become of Miss Godesby and her brother ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>When you went upstairs with your mother , they went down the road .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>You know originally the idea was I was to marry you .</p>

     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>Really —</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laughingly .</stage>Yes , and mama cut me out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>Oh , well , it can n't be helped ; we can n't marry everybody .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Noticing the bells .</stage>Somebody else arriving ! That 's queer — nobody comes here in the winter ; that 's why we chose it , because it would be quiet ! Let 's play this game .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Going to an iron frog on a box which stands near the house .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps it 's Mrs. Sterling .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>No ; if she was coming at all , she 'd have come in time for the wedding .<stage>She takes up the disks which lie beside the frog .</stage>I should hate to get married like you and mama — no splurge and no presents ! Why , the presents 'd be half the fun ! And think of all those you and she 've given in your life , and have lost now a good chance of getting back .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Throws a disk into the frog 's open mouth .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>I 'll give your mother all the presents she wants . I can afford it ; I do n't want anybody to give us anything !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>You talk like Jess !<stage>Throws another disk .</stage>You know Jess earns her own living . She goes around to smart women 's houses answering their invitations and letters for ‘ em . She calls it being a visiting secretary , but I tell her she 's a co-respon-dent !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Throws a disk .</stage>
    <stage>WARDEN and MASON enter from behind the house quickly , with a manner of suppressed excitement . They are surprised to find CLARA and TROTTER .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Why , here they are !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>No , only Miss Clara and Trotter .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Lucky I met you — you must take me back in your sleigh .</p>

     <p>Yes , the riding 's beastly .</p>

     <p>Yes — er — er — a — many happy returns , Mr. Trotter .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>It 's a great day for me , Mr. Mason !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Wish you joy , Trotter !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Embarrassed and not going near him . TROTTER rushes eagerly to him and grasps his hand warmly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>Thank you , old man ! I say ! Thank you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>Miss Clara , would you do me the great favor of going down the road and hurrying the Godesbys back if you see them ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I do n't mind ; come along , Trotty !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>You must excuse Trotter . I want a talk with him if he will give me five minutes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>Oh , certainly .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She goes out Left behind the house .</stage>

     <p><stage>To MASON .</stage>Will you see Mrs. Hunter ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>I beg your pardon , Mrs. Trotter !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Politely .</stage>I beg yours .<stage>To MASON .</stage>See Mrs. Trotter .</p>

     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Aside to WARDEN .</stage>You 're going to ask him to go on Dick 's note for Ryder ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a low voice .</stage>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>You 're a wonder ! As if he would !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Somebody must , and there 's nobody else . That boy and that mother have got to be saved !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sorry my name 's no good for us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>And mine must n't be used .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>No , indeed ! The minute that was done , there 'd be a new complication , and more trouble would tumble down on Mrs. Sterling 's head . Good luck .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Shakes his hand and enters the house .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>What 's up ? You have n't come to kick about my wedding , have you ? I would n't stand for that , you know !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>It 's not that , Mr. Trotter . Your wife 's son-in-law , Sterling , has turned out a blackguard ; he has had intrusted to him Miss Ruth Hunter 's money and several other people 's , and he 's used it all for speculation of his own .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>Then he 's a damned thief !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He sits on the bench with the manner that he has settled the subject .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>So he is , and he 's ruined .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>Well , prison is the place for him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>We wo n't argue that , but how about his family — they get punished for what he has done ; they must share his disgrace .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>Oh , well , my wife is out of all that now — she 's Mrs. Trotter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Yes , but her own daughter suffers .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p><stage>On the defensive .</stage>She is n't very chummy with her classy eldest daughter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Never mind that ; you know without my telling you that Mrs. Sterling is a fine woman .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>She 's always snubbed me right and left , but , by George , I must own she is a fine woman .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>That 's right !<stage>Clapping him on the back and putting his arm around his shoulder .</stage>Look here — help us save her !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>How ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Indorse a note of Sterling 's to give Ryder to keep him quiet .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>I 'd have to ask my wife .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>No ! Do n't start off like that ! Keep the reins in your own hands at the very beginning ,— make her realize from this very day that you 're raised up on the cushion beside her ; that she 's sitting lower down admiring the scenery , while you do the driving through life !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Half laughing .</stage>Ha ! I guess you 're right . Box seat and reins are good enough for me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Good boy ! Then we can count on you to sign this note ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>Where 's my security ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>I can get you security if you want it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>Of course I want it ! And I say , where are you ? Why are n't you in it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>There are reasons why my name had better not appear ; you are in the family . But I 'll tell you what I 'll do , Trotter ; I 'll secure you with a note of my own — only you must keep it dark ; you must n't even let Mason know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>All right , perhaps I 'm a Dodo bird , but I 'll do it . Say , I seem to have married a good many of this classy family !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Trotter , no one 's done you justice ! And , by George ! you deserve a better fate — er — I mean — my best wishes on your wedding day .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>TROTTER shakes his hand delightedly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TROTTER</speaker>
     <p>Great day for me ! What I wanted was style and position , and some one classy who would know how to spend my money for me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Well , you 've got that , surely !</p>

    </sp>
    <stage>Comes forward .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Both of you trusted Dick Sterling .</p>

     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>What 's he done ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Misused your funds .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>How d'you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>I mean that the money you intrusted to him is gone , and I 've come to make a proposition to you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Gone ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>GODESBY and MISS GODESBY are aghast . A second 's silence , during which GODESBY and MISS GODESBY look at each other , then back at WARDEN .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Do you mean to say —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>The money is gone , every penny of it , and I want you to accept a note from Sterling to cover the amount .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>I can n't grasp it !</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Where is Sterling ? Why did n't he come ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>He was ashamed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>I should hope so !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Several of us are going to stick by him ; we 'll manage to put him on his feet again , and we want you to accept his note .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GODESBY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Incredulous .</stage>Accept his note ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Also incredulous .</stage>On what security ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GODESBY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quickly .</stage>You 'll do nothing of the sort , Julia !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>That would n't bring you back your money .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Neither will his note !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>If I get it indorsed ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GODESBY</speaker>

     <p>Rather !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>I want your silence to keep it from the public for the family 's sake . I 've secured a satisfactory indorser for a note to satisfy Ryder 's claim .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Why did n't you give him to me instead of Ryder ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>I felt you would be willing , out of friendship —</p>

     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Out of friendship for his wife .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Blanche Sterling ! I never could bear her ! She 's always treated me like the dirt under her feet !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>That was to please her mother . No , if my money 's gone , Sterling 's got to suffer , and the one slight consolation I shall have will be that Blanche Sterling will have to come off her high horse .</p>

     <p>I 've had it out with Sterling ! I am here as his representative . I give you my word of honor Sterling will not run away . It is under such an understanding with him that I am pleading his case in his stead . He will stay here and work till he has paid you back , every cent .</p>

     <p>Sterling ? Gone ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Gone ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>That 's good !</p>

     <p>Do n't be a fool , Godesby . How do you mean “ gone , ” Miss Hunter ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
     <p>I do n't altogether know . While I was out this morning , Blanche received a message from mother saying she 'd been —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She hesitates , looking toward GODESBY and MISS GODESBY .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>They know . They 're your mother 's guests here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
     <p>She told Blanche they would be glad to have her here at one o'clock for breakfast . Blanche ordered the sleigh at once and went away , leaving word for me I was to open any message which might come for her .</p>

     <p><stage>To GODESBY .</stage>Has she been here ?</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
     <p>No , they say not . She probably went first to Aunt Ruth 's . Before I got back , Dick , who 'd been out —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>He was at my house .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
     <p>Yes . He came back , questioned Jordan as to where Blanche was , went upstairs , and then went away again , leaving a note for Blanche , which I found when I came home —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Eagerly .</stage>Yes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
     <p>It simply said , “ Good-by . Dick . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Very angry .</stage>Oh !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GODESBY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quickly .</stage>He 's taken a train ! He 's cleared out !</p>

     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Do you know if he took a bag or anything with him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
     <p>No , he took nothing of that sort . Jordan went into his room and found a drawer open and empty , a drawer in which Dick kept — a pistol !—</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She drops her voice almost to a whisper .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Good God , he 's shot himself !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps not — he left the house .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Yes , if he were really determined to shoot himself , why would n't he have done it there in his own room ?</p>

     <speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
     <p>What can we do ? What can we do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>

     <speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
     <p>He can go with me ; I 'd better be at the house . Some one must be there .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Good !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes into the house .</stage>
    <stage>MISS GODESBY and her brother ignore and apparently forget the presence of JESSICA in their excitement . They both speak and move excitedly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>I ought to have suspected something when Sterling told me he was getting ten per cent for my money ,— the blackguard !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>I always told you you were a fool not to take care of your money yourself ! You know more about business than most men .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>I did n't want to be bothered ; besides , there was always something very attractive about Sterling . I do n't mind telling you that if he had fallen in love with me instead of the stiff-necked woman he married , I 'd have tumbled over myself to get him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>How do you feel about him now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Now ! Thank God , I 'm saved such a waking up ! It 's going to make a big difference with my income , Howard ! I wonder if his wife knew he was crooked ! I 'll bet you she 's got a pot of money stowed away all right in her own name .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Not till you 've given me your promise , both of you , that you will keep silent about the embezzlement of your bonds for the sake of Mrs. Sterling and her son .</p>

     <p><stage>Half laughs .</stage>Huh !</p>

    <stage>Sleigh-bells start up loud and die off quickly ; JESSICA has gone .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , come , you know what sort of friends we are ,— for the amusement we can get out of each other . This is the case ,— I trusted this man with my affairs . He was very attractive — I do n't deny that ; business with Dick Sterling became more or less of a pleasure — but that does n't cut any ice with me ; he 's stolen my money . To put it plainly , he 's a common thief , and he ought to be punished ; why should he go scot free and a lot of others not ? You know perfectly well his note would n't be worth the paper it was written on ; and , anyway , if he has n't gone and sneaked out of the world , I wo n't lift my little finger to keep him from the punishment he deserves !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Good for you , Julia !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Do n't you put your oar in , Godesby ; just let this matter rest between your sister and me ! She 's always been known as the best man in your family .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>You do n't choose a very conciliatory way of bringing us around !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>I 'm not choosing any way at all ; I 'm striking right out from the shoulder . There is n't time for beating round the bush ! I 'm pleading for the good name and honorable position of a perfectly innocent , a fine , woman , and for the reputation and unimpeded career of her son ! And I make that appeal as man to man and woman !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>I have nothing to do with any one in this matter but Sterling himself , who has robbed me , and I 'll gladly see him suffer for it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Now look here , Miss Godesby , you belong to a pretty tough crowd in society , but I know at heart you 're not a bad sort ! What good will it do you ? Granted even that you do n't care for Mrs. Sterling , still do n't tell me you 're the kind of woman to take a cruel pleasure in seeing another woman suffer ! I would n't believe it ! You 're not one of those catty creatures ! You 're a clever woman , and I do n't doubt you can be a pretty hard one , too , at times ; but you 're just — that 's the point now — you 're JUST —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Interrupting .</stage>Exactly ! I 'm just , an eye for an eye ! Sterling is a thief , let him get the deserts of one !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She sits on the bench determinedly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>But you can n't look at only one side ! You can n't shut your eyes to his wife 's suffering , too , and she does n't deserve it ! Neither does her boy deserve to share his disgrace .<stage>He sits beside her .</stage>Why , you have it in your power to handicap that boy through his whole life by publishing his father a criminal ; or you can give that boy a fair show to prove himself more his mother 's son than his father 's , and to live an honest — who knows — perhaps a noble life !</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>I refuse to accept such a responsibility . Ryder —</p>

     <p>You 'll have many a heart wrench , I 'll bet you ! You 'll have to run across the results of the harm you do to Mrs. Sterling and Richard day in and day out , year after year ! I do n't believe you realize what it means ! Why , I know you can n't bear to see a dog suffer ! I met you last week on the street carrying a mangy , crippled brute of a little dog in your arms , afraid lest he 'd get into the hands of the vivisectionists , and yet here you 'll let a boy and his mother —</p>

     <p><stage>Follows her .</stage>I 'm only knocking at the door of your heart . And now because it 's opened just a tiny way , you want to shut it in my face again . Will you leave this woman 's name fit for her to use ? Wo n't you make that boy 's life worth living to him ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p><stage>After a moment 's pause , looks straight into WARDEN 'S face .</stage>I 'll tell you what I 'll do . Get me some security , some sort of indorsement of Sterling 's note —</p>

I 'm going to tell you something I 've never even told myself . I 'm going to put you to a big test , because I 've got to . Apparently , I can n't help myself ; but after all , somehow I believe in the human nature in you , and you 've got it in your power to help or hurt the woman I love — I say those words aloud for the first time — the woman I love !</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>Never ; and you show how little you really know her when you ask that question ! She loves her husband .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>I 'm not so sure about that !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>I am , and I love her . But surely the silent love of a man , like mine , is no insult to a good woman — cannot harm her ! A love that is never spoken , not even whispered , can n't hurt any one , except , perhaps , the one who loves . You must acknowledge even you have never heard a hint ; you showed just now your real surprise at what circumstances revealed to you ! I 'd die sooner than bring the slightest shadow of a scandal on her , and I 've hugged my secret tight . Have you any idea what such a love means ? How it grows and grows , its strength shut in , held back , doubling and redoubling its powers !— its ideality increasing , the passion suppressed , locked up ! Good God ! I tremble sometimes when I think — suppose some day it should burst out , break my control , MASTER ME !<stage>A pause .</stage>And here , now , I 've told you ; I 'm sorry , but I had to for her sake again . Will you help me keep my secret ?</p>

This SERVANT speaks with a slight French accent . As he reaches the house , WARDEN stops him with a question , and the GODESBYS ’ sleigh-bells start up and quickly die away .

    </sp>
    <stage>He goes into the house .</stage>
    <stage>The sun grows red , and the colors of sunset creep over the sky during the scene which follows . After a moment the SERVANT shows BLANCHE out from the house .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Surprised and depressed .</stage>Good morning , Mr . Warden , have you been asked to these funeral baked meats ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>No , I 'll explain why I am here in a few minutes . Only let me ask you first when you last saw your husband ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Early this morning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>And you have come just now from where ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Aunt Ruth 's . Of course you know about my mother ? When I heard it I started to come here , but my heart failed me and I turned back to my aunt 's . She has persuaded me that I ought to come and put the best face on the matter possible , but it seems as if I 'd had now a little more than I can bear !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Her voice breaks and her eyes fill with tears .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Almost tenderly .</stage>Shall we go inside ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>No , no ! Let us stay out in the air ; my head would burst in one of these close little rooms . Have you seen mother ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>No , not yet .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Where is Dick ? Did he go to Ryder 's ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>No , but I have some good news to tell you all the same — Ryder has promised silence .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With tremendous relief .</stage>Oh ! that 's too good , too good to be true ! To whom did he promise ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>I want you not to ask me that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>I can guess , it was —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Lying .</stage>No , it was — Mason .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Doubting him .</stage>Mr. Mason ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>And I 've more good news for you , Mrs. Sterling — the Godesbys , too ; they will be silent .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>You 're sure ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>We have their word !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pointedly .</stage>Mr. Mason again ?—</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>WARDEN bows his head in assent . ] He was here ?</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Some time ago , but only for a minute . He did n't stay ; he went to find your husband .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>But the Godesbys ? I just met them now on the road going back . How could Mr. Mason , if he did n't stay —<stage>WARDEN is embarrassed , and is silent , searching a way out of it .</stage>Oh , no ! no ! it was n't Mr. Mason ! I see the whole thing clearly . Dick was too great a coward , and you did it ! It was you who won over Ryder ! It was you who persuaded the Godesbys !—</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>WARDEN shakes his head and makes a movement to deny it . BLANCHE continues speaking , the words rushing to her lips , as her pent-up heart opens and lets all her emotions suddenly free . ] Do n't try to deny it ; you can n't make me believe you ! It 's to you I owe whatever promise the future has for me ! It is you who have given me all the happiness I 've had for years . It is you who have watched over , taken care of , me — you , the best friend any woman in this world ever had . It is you now who have saved my boy 's honor . It is you who lift the weight off my shoulders , the weight off my heart ! You !— you !— you !</stage>
    <stage>She sinks sobbing on the bench . It begins to snow very quietly and slowly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>All his love bursting out into his face and into his voice , cries .</stage>Blanche ! Blanche !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Leaning over her as if to protect her from her trouble and take her to his breast .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rising and looking straight into his eyes with a suddenly revealed great love in her own .</stage>Ned !—</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They hold this position some moments , gazing into each other 's eyes ; then finally WARDEN makes a movement towards her , crying out more triumphantly , having read and realized her love for him .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Blanche !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>No ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Look — look , it 's beginning to snow !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Very softly .</stage>What do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Desperately .</stage>I mean to speak of anything except what is in your thoughts at this moment ! Help me not to forget that no matter what he has done , Dick is still my husband .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>You do n't know all he has done !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>How not “ all ” ? What else ? Where is he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>With a sudden new alarm .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>He has left you .</p>

     <p><stage>Echoes .</stage>Left me ?—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Mason is searching for him . He left a note at your house which</l>
      <l>Jess read ; it was only one word “ Good-by . ”</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Echoes again .</stage>Good-by !<stage>Sleigh-bells are heard in the distance , coming quickly nearer .</stage>What does it mean ? You 're hiding something from me ! Tell me what else you know ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>He left the house , but took something with him — something from a drawer in his room .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>After a second 's pause she whispers .</stage>His pistol ?</p>

     <p>Yes .</p>

     <p><stage>Aghast , still whispers .</stage>Has he done it ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know ; I 'm waiting word from Mason .</p>

    <stage>The sleigh-bells stop .</stage>

     <p><stage>Excited .</stage>But we can n't wait here doing nothing ; we must go , too !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Mason is doing all that can be done ; we 'd better wait here .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He takes her hand in sympathy , but without suggesting the passion of a few moments before . STERLING enters hurriedly Left . He is wild with drink and jealousy .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Drop my wife 's hand !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They turn in great surprise .</stage>

    <stage>Fright at his appearance is mingled with her surprise .</stage>

     <p><stage>At the same time as BLANCHE .</stage>Sterling !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They do not drop hands .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coming nearer , very strong .</stage>Drop my wife 's hand !<stage>They do so quickly , not understanding yet .</stage>So I 've caught you !</p>

     <p><stage>Angry .</stage>Caught us !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I had my suspicions roused some time ago !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Of what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>I could go to the devil — what did you two care ! I could go to State 's Prison ! All the better — out of your way !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>You 're speaking like a madman !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>I went back to my house this morning ; my wife was gone — no message left where to ! But I questioned the servant . She 'd driven here ! Why ? Ha !<stage>A bitter half laugh ; he turns to BLANCHE .</stage>You 've come here once too often !</p>

     <p><stage>To WARDEN , but ignoring his exclamation .</stage>Then I went to your house . They knew where you 'd gone ! You ought to train your servants better ! Both here !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>If you 're not careful , I 'll ram your insinuations down your throat .</p>

     <p><stage>Seizing STERLING by the throat .</stage>Do n't you finish !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Sh !— for Heaven 's sake !<stage>To WARDEN .</stage>Let him alone ; I 'm not afraid of what he says .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>WARDEN leaves STERLING .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>No , you never were a liar , I 'll give you credit for that ,— so confess the truth — you 're his —</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Excited beyond her control .</stage>Listen ! And you shall have the truth if you want it ! These years that he 's been befriending me I never dreamed of loving him nor thought of his loving me .<stage>DICK sneers .</stage>Wait ! No , not even the day my father was buried , when I learned outright you were dishonest !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Surprised .</stage>What do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>What I say — I learned it then from a paper of my father 's . I should n't have kept my knowledge to myself — I see that now ; but I did , for your sake , not for love of you — the love went for good that day . But here , a moment ago , I realized for the first time that my old friend did love me , love me with an ideal devotion the noblest woman in the world might be proud of ! I did n't tell him then I loved him , but now I take this chance , I take it GLADLY before you !— forced by you ! I tell him now , what perhaps he has already guessed , I love him with all my heart — I love him ! I LOVE HIM !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Damn you both ! then it 's the end of me !</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Seizes STERLING , catches his arm , and wrenches the pistol from him .</stage>So that 's what you planned to do , is it — make a wretched scene like that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>It begins to snow more heavily .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>In utter collapse and shame .</stage>Why did you stop me ? I 'm better out of the world . I 'm crazy with shame . First I disgraced and now I 've insulted — degraded — the only living thing I care for ,— that 's my wife .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>A moment 's pause .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Speaks quietly .</stage>Come back to the house . Mr. Mason is looking for you ; he has something to tell you .</p>

     <stage>The following morning ; at the STERLINGS ’ ; the library ; a warm , livable , and lovable room , full of pictures , photographs , and books ; mistletoe and holly decorate everywhere . In the bow-window at back there is a large bird-cage with half a dozen birds in it . The furniture is comfortable and heavily upholstered . At Left there is a fireplace with logs ready , but the fire is not lit . There a big table near the centre , full of magazines , illustrated papers , and books . A big arm-chair is beside the table , and other chairs conversationally close . There is a table near the door at Right , piled with Christmas gifts , still wrapped in white paper ; they are tied with many colored ribbons and bunches of holly . There are doors Right and Left . After the curtain rises on an empty stage , RUTH enters quickly ; while she has her buoyant manner , she is , of course , more serious than usual . She carries a bunch of fresh violets in her hand . She looks about the room with a sort of curiosity . She is waiting for some one to appear . She takes up a silver-framed photograph of her brother which stands on a table and speaks aloud to it .</stage>

      <l>Is n't it awful ! What are you going to do ?</l>

    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know yet , mother .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Do n't know ? Absolute divorce — no legal separation !</l>
      <stage>To RUTH .</stage>
      <l>We 're staying at the Waldorf .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <stage>BLANCHE sits discouragedly on the sofa .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sitting beside her .</stage>I shall advise against , and do everything in my power to prevent , Blanche 's getting a divorce !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>You do n't mean to say you 'll carry those ridiculous notions of yours into practice ?— now that a scandal has come into our very family ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I know selfish , cynical , and worldly people wo n't agree with me , and I pity and sympathize with Blanche from the bottom of my heart .<stage>Taking and holding BLANCHE 'S hand .</stage>But I want her not to decide anything now ; wait till the first blows over , and then — well , then I feel sure she will do the strong , noble thing — the difficult thing — not the easy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Withdraws her hand from RUTH 'S .</stage>No , you ask too much of me , Aunt Ruth ; I can n't do it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>I say do n't decide now — wait .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>I do n't want to wait . I want to decide now and to cut my life free , entirely , from Dick 's .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>You used to agree with me . I 've heard you decry these snapshot , rapid-transit , tunnel divorces many a time . I 've heard you say when a woman has made her bed , she must lie in it — make the best of her bad bargain .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>I always sympathized with a woman who sought a divorce in this state .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , yes , but you can n't , can you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>No , but I 'm not strong enough to fight out an unhappy life for the sake of setting an example to other women — women who do n't want the example set !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Blanche , I counted on you to be strong , to be big —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a voice full of emotion .</stage>But I love Ned Warden . He loves me — life stretches out long before us . Dick has disgraced us all . I do n't love him — should I give my happiness and Mr . Warden 's happiness for him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>Absurd ! We all have a right to happiness if we can get it . I have chosen ; let Blanche follow my example .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Disgusted .</stage>Yours ?<stage>Rises .</stage>Oh !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Following up the advantage .</stage>Yes , Blanche , do you want to follow your mother 's example ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>No ! But the cases are not analogous !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>Not what ? You need n't fling any innuendoes at Mr. Trotter ; it 's he who said it was my duty to stand by you , advise you , and all that sort of thing . I 'm not here to please myself ! Goodness knows , a divorce court is n't a very pleasant place to spend your honeymoon !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Thank both you and Mr. Trotter , mother ; but I ask you to allow</l>
      <l>Aunt Ruth and me to decide this matter between us .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>Trotter says divorce was made for woman !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>And what was made for man , please ? Polygamy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know anything about politics ! But I could count a dozen women in a breath , all divorced , or trying to be , or ought to be !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>And each one of them getting a cold shoulder .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>What of it if their hearts are warm — poor climbers after happiness !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Believe me , dear , the chill spreads . You 're going to be selfish ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>She 's going to be sensible .</p>

     <p>He is n't what I thought him !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>The day the sun shone on you as a bride , in God 's presence , you said you took him for better for worse —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>Dear me , is that in it ? The marriage service ought to be expurgated !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p><stage>To CLARA .</stage>I 'm ashamed of you .</p>

     <p>That 's nothing new !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Aunt Ruth , let us talk some other time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>Oh , if we are in the way , we 'll go !</p>

     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>Yes , come on , let 's go to Atlantic City .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>No , I 'd rather go to Lakewood .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Oh , pshaw , Lakewood 's no fun ! I 'm surprised you do n't say go to</l>
      <l>Aiken , North Carolina .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Trotter says we can n't leave town anyway while Blanche is in this trouble .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Mother , please discuss your affairs somewhere else .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>And if I may be permitted to suggest , you will find Mr. Trotter 's advice always pretty good to follow . That young man has better qualities than we have suspected . I have some thing to thank him for ; will you be good enough to ask him to come and see me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>He will not go to your house with my permission . I shall tell him you have never asked me inside your door .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>Mother , if you ask me —<stage>MRS. HUNTER interjects “ Which I do n't , ” but CLARA continues without paying any attention to the interruption .</stage>— I do n't think Mr. Trotter is going to cry himself to sleep for your permission about anything !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p><stage>To BLANCHE .</stage>Good-by , my dear ; if you want me , let me know ; I 'll be glad to do anything I can . I 'm staying at the Waldorf .</p>

     <p>It 's full of people from Kansas and Wyoming Territory come to hear the Opera !</p>

     <p>Ah ! Got you there ! The west is the place where the divorces come from !</p>

     <p>Oh , very well , good-by !<stage>LEONARD enters Right with a Christmas parcel , which he places on the table Right .</stage>Dear me , have you had all these Christmas presents and not opened them ?</p>

      <l>Christmas to-day .</l>
     </lg>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. HUNTER</speaker>
     <p>It 's a terrible affair ; I only hope the newspapers wo n't get hold of it .<stage>To LEONARD .</stage>If any women come here asking for me who look like ladies , do n't let ‘ em in ! They ai n't my friends ; they 're reporters .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>LEONARD bows and goes out .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARA</speaker>
     <p>I 'm awfully sorry , Blanche , I honestly am ; but I think you 'll have only yourself to blame if you do n't strike out now and throw Dick over . Good-by !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MRS. HUNTER and CLARA go out Right .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>I wish they would n't advise me to do what I want to .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Ah !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>But who do I harm by it ? Surely , it would n't be for his good to be brought up under the influence of his father !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>If he saw you patiently bearing a cross for the sake of duty , can you imagine a stronger force for good on the boy 's character ? What an example you will set him ! What a chance for a mother !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>But my own life , my own happiness ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Ah , my dear , that 's just it ! The watchword of our age is self ! We are all for ourselves ; the twentieth century is to be a glorification of selfishness , the Era of Egotism ! Forget yourself , and what would you do ? The dignified thing . You would live quietly beside your husband if not with him . And your son would be worthy of such a mother !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>And I ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>You would be glad in the end .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Surely ! Blanche , for twenty years Mr. Mason and I have loved each other .<stage>BLANCHE is astonished . There is a pause .</stage><stage>RUTH smiles while she speaks , though her voice breaks .</stage>You never guessed ! Ah , well , your father knew .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>But Mrs. Mason is hopelessly insane ; surely —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>A principle is a principle ; I took my stand against divorce . What can you do for a principle if you do n't give up everything for it ? Nothing ! And that is what I mean . To-day I am not sorry — I am happy .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>There is another slight pause . RICHARD is heard upstairs singing a Christmas carol , “ Once in Royal David 's City , ” etc .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With great emotion .</stage>But if it breaks my heart — if it breaks my heart ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Hearts do n't break from the pain that comes of doing right , but from the sorrow of doing wrong !<stage>Neither woman speaks for a minute ; in the silence RUTH hears RICHARD .</stage>What 's that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hearing now for the first time .</stage>Richard singing one of his carols .</p>

     <p>Doctor Steinhart is here to see Mr. Sterling . Where shall I show him , madame ?</p>

     <p>Here ; we 'll go —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Rising .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LEONARD</speaker>
     <p>Yes , madame .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Well ? What are you going to do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>I 'm thinking —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>May I come with you , or shall I —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>No , come .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The two women start to leave the room together Right , with their arms around each other . They meet STERLING , who enters ; he starts , they stop .</stage>

    <stage>The women go out Right . At the same moment DR. STEINHART is shown in by LEONARD Left .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. STEINHART</speaker>
     <p>Good morning , Sterling .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>Good morning , doctor ; sit down .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. STEINHART</speaker>
     <p>No , thanks , I 'm very rushed this morning . What can I do for you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>I 've been drinking too much for some time ; I can n't eat — my nerves are all gone to pieces . I 've some — some business troubles , and I have n't slept for a week .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. STEINHART</speaker>
     <p>Is that all ! Brace up , help yourself a little , and we can soon make a man of you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>I 'm afraid it would take more than a doctor to do that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. STEINHART</speaker>
     <p>Oh , come , we must get rid of melancholy . Come and drive with me to 79th Street .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>No , I 'm too worn out . Look at my hand !<stage>Holds out a trembling hand .</stage>I tell you literally I have n't slept for weeks — I thought you 'd give me some chloral or something .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. STEINHART</speaker>
     <p>What ? Now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Yes ; I 've tried sulphonal and all that rot ; if does n't have any effect on me . Give me a hypodermic —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. STEINHART</speaker>
     <p>Nonsense ! Come out into the air !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>I 've been out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. STEINHART</speaker>
     <p>Good ! Then try lying down again , and perhaps you 'll go to sleep now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Very well , but give me something to take to-night in case I can n't sleep then .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. STEINHART</speaker>
     <p><stage>Takes out a note-book and writes with a stylographic pen .</stage>Be careful what you eat to-day . How about this drinking — did your business trouble come after it began , or did the whiskey come after the business trouble ?</p>

     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>That 's it .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Um —<stage>Giving STERLING the paper which he tears out of his note-book .</stage>Look here , I 've a busy day before me ; but I 'll look in to-morrow , and we 'll have a good talk .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Thank you . I say , what is this ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. STEINHART</speaker>
     <p>It 's all right . Sulphate of morphia — one-quarter-grain tablets .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Is n't that very little ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. STEINHART</speaker>
     <p>Oh , no ; you try one , and repeat in an hour if it has n't done its work .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>But you 've only given me two tablets , and I tell you I 'm awfully hard to influence !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. STEINHART</speaker>
     <p>Two 's enough ; we do n't give a lot of drugs to a man in a nervous condition like yours . Do n't let them wake you for luncheon if you 're asleep . Sleep 's best for you . Good-by — pleasant dreams .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out Left .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Reads off the prescription .</stage>“ Two one-quarter-grain tablets sulphate of morphia , Wm . B. Steinhart — ” And in ink ! Why did n't he write it with a lead-pencil ? How can I make it more ? Two — wait a minute ! Two !<stage>Taking out his own stylographic pen .</stage>What 's his ink ?<stage>Makes a mark with his pen on his cuff .</stage>Good ! the same ! Why not make it twelve ?<stage>Marking a one before the two .</stage>Just in case — I might as well be on the safe side !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He rings an electric bell beside the mantel , and waves the paper in the air to dry it . BLANCHE enters Right .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>I heard the doctor go . Is anything serious the matter ?</p>

     <p>Yes , sir .</p>

     <speaker>LEONARD</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out Left .</stage>
    <stage>BLANCHE is still standing . STERLING sinks into a chair , and puts his head in his hands , his elbows on the table . He lifts his head and looks at her .</stage>

     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>

     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>What !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>His hands drop to the table ; he looks her straight in the face , doubting what he hears .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking back into his eyes .</stage>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Cries .</stage>Blanche !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>In a tone of amazement and joy .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>I give you one more chance , for your sake only as my boy 's father . But — do n't make it impossible for me — do you understand ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Yes ! I must take the true advantage of this chance your goodness gives me . I must right myself , so that people need not hesitate to speak of his father in Richard 's presence . And this I will do .<stage>With great conviction he rises .</stage>I know I am at the cross-roads , and I know the way ; but I do n't choose it for your reasons ; I choose for my own reason — which is that , unfit as I am , I love you .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He speaks deliberately and with real feeling , bending over her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>I tell you truly my love for you is gone for good .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I 'll win it back — you did love me , you did , did n't you ,</l>
      <l>Blanche ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>I loved the man I thought you were . Do you remember that day in the mountains when we first really came to know each other , when we walked many , many miles without dreaming of being tired ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>And found ourselves at sunset at the top instead of below , by our hotel ! Oh , yes , I remember ! The world changed for me that day .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He sinks back into the arm-chair , overcome , in his weakened state , by his memories and his realization of what he has made of the present .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>And for me ! I knew then for the first time you loved me , and that I loved you . Oh ! how short life of a sudden seemed ! Not half long enough for the happiness it held for me !<stage>She turns upon him with a vivid change of feeling .</stage>Has it turned out so ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>How different ! Oh , what a beast ! what a fool !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Speaking with pathetic emotion , tears in her throat and in her eyes .</stage>And that early summer 's day you asked me to be your wife !<stage>She gives a little exclamation , half a sob , half a laugh .</stage>It was in the corner of the garden ; I can smell the lilacs now ! And the raindrops fell from the branches as my happy tears did on father 's shoulder that night , when I said , “ Father , he will make me the happiest woman in the world ! ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>O God ! to have your love back !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>You can n't breathe life back into a dead thing ; how different the world would be if one could !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>You can bring back life to the drowned ; perhaps your love is only drowned in the sorrow I 've caused .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiles sadly and shakes her head ; the smile dies away .</stage>Life to me then was like a glorious staircase , and I mounted happy step after step led by your hand till everything seemed to culminate on the day of our wedding . You men do n't , can n't realize , what that service means to a girl . In those few moments she parts from all that have cherished her , made her life , and gives her whole self , her love , her body , and even her soul sometimes — for love often overwhelms us women — to the man who , she believes , wants , starves , for her gifts . All that a woman who marries for love feels at the altar I tell you a man can n't understand ! You treated this gift of mine , Dick , like a child does a Santa Claus plaything — for a while you were never happy away from it , then you grew accustomed to it , then you broke it , and now you have even lost the broken pieces !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Comes to her , growing more and more determined .</stage>I will find them , and put them together again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Again smiles sadly and shakes her head .</stage>First we made of every Tuesday a festival — our wedding anniversary . After a while we kept the twenty-eighth of every month ! The second year you were satisfied with the twenty-eighth of April only , and last year you forgot the day altogether . And yet what a happy first year it was !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Ah , you see I did make you happy once !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Blessedly happy ! Our long silences in those days were not broken by an oath and a fling out of the room . Oh , the happiness it means to a wife to see it is hard for her husband to leave her in the morning , and to be taken so quickly — even roughly — into his arms at night that she knows he has been longing to come back to her . Nothing grew tame that first year . And at its end I climbed to the highest step I had reached yet , when you leaned over my bed and cried big man 's tears , the first I 'd ever seen you cry , and kissed me first , and then little Richard lying on my warm arm , and said , “ God bless you , little mother . ”<stage>There is a pause . BLANCHE cries softly a moment . STERLING is silent , ashamed . Again she turns upon him , rousing herself , but with a voice broken with emotion .</stage>And what a bad father you 've been to that boy !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>I did n't mean to ! That 's done , that 's past , but Richard 's my boy . I 'll make him proud of me , somehow ! I 'll win your love back — you 'll see !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>BLANCHE is about to speak in remonstrance , but stops because of the entrance of LEONARD . He brings a small chemist 's box of tablets in an envelope and a glass of water on a small silver tray .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LEONARD</speaker>
     <p>Your medicine , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He puts it on the table and goes out Right .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Thank you , thank you !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He takes the box of tablets out of the envelope .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Going to him .</stage>You do n't realize why I 've told you all this !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Counting out the tablets .</stage>One , two . To give me hope ! To give me hope !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He empties the other ten tablets into the envelope , twists it up , and throws it in the fireplace .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>No , no , just the opposite !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Then you 've defeated your end , dear ; you will stay here with me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Trying to make him realize the exact position .</stage>Opposite you at the table , receiving our friends , keeping up appearances , yes — but nearer to you than that ? No ! Never !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>But you will stay ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>LEONARD enters from Left .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LEONARD</speaker>
     <p>Miss Godesby , Mr . Warden .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They enter .</stage>
    <stage>All greet each other . WARDEN nods stiffly to STERLING , barely acknowledging his greeting .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p><stage>To STERLING , purposely speaking with good-humored raillery to relieve the tension of the situation .</stage>Well , you 're a nice lot , are n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>I 'm so ashamed ! I 'm so ashamed !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , never mind that now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>I have no words to thank you with .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , that 's all right . The truth is , I 've made Warden bring me here , Sterling , for a bit of business . I had an emotional moment yesterday and went off my head a bit . I stand by what I said as to keeping quiet , but — well , I 'm like any other old maid who hates dust on her mantelpiece — I 'm fidgety not to make some sort of a bluff at putting this thing on a business basis .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Excuse me , Miss Godesby , I think Sterling ought to know the truth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Now what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Well , the truth is , my fool of a brother has kicked up an infernal row , and refuses to hold his tongue .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Then I 'm ruined after all !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Wait , I 've left him with Mr. Mason . I feel certain I can assure his silence if I can only show him some sort of an agreement to pay , an acknowledgment of the — the — affair , signed and sealed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Signed by whom ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Your husband and yourself will do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>But both names are worthless .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Not as a point of honor .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Ah ! no , not my wife 's .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Nor yours to me . Come along !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She goes to the table with STERLING , and unfolding a paper gives it to him . He signs it .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Aside to BLANCHE , apologizing for his presence .</stage>She made me come — she would n't come alone ; otherwise I should have waited till you sent for me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>It 's as well — I 've decided . Oh , I wonder if I 'm doing wrong .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Looking him straight in the face .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking back searchingly in hers to read the truth , but believing that she will certainly leave her husband .</stage>No , you can n't do wrong ! But I must warn you of one thing — I 'm not any longer the controlled man I was .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Come along now , Mrs. Sterling , brace up and give me your name , and Warden , witness , please .<stage>They do so .</stage>Of course , my dears , I know perfectly well that legally this is n't worth the paper it 's written on .<stage>Exchanging a serious and meaning look with WARDEN .</stage>But my idiot of a brother wo n't realize that , which is the point . One thing more — will you both dine with me next week , Thursday ?<stage>There is an embarrassed pause , which , with quick intuition , she understands .</stage>Yes , you will — for silence gives consent !<stage>Laughing .</stage>Now , that 's settled !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>What an awfully good sort you are !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>Thanks , not always — I 've been a mucker more than once in my life ! I must go<stage>Shaking hands with BLANCHE .</stage>and relieve Mr. Mason of my brother , or he 'll be accusing me of inhuman treatment ; more than one consecutive hour of my brother ought to be prevented by the police .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>You are very , very good .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p>I think if you and I can get well over this , we 'll be real friends , and I have n't many , have you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Takes her hand .</stage>You can count upon me and my boy so long as we live .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She impulsively but tenderly kisses her .</stage>
    <stage>MISS GODESBY is very much surprised , but moved .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GODESBY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Half laughing , half crying , and pulling her veil down to hide her emotion .</stage>By George ! I have n't been kissed by a woman for years ! Good-by .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>WARDEN starts to go out with MISS GODESBY . BLANCHE stops him .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Wait one moment — I want to speak alone to Miss Godesby .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MISS GODESBY goes out Left .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Aside to STERLING .</stage>You tell him ; I cannot . Tell him the truth .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She goes out after MISS GODESBY .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Dick .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Ned ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>I have nothing to say to you , Sterling .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>WARDEN looks away and whistles a tune to show his unwillingness to listen . STERLING speaks clearly so WARDEN shall hear .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>I have a message for you from my wife .<stage>There is a second 's pause . WARDEN stops whistling and turns and looks at STERLING .</stage>She asks me to explain — to tell — to tell you a decision she has come to .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>There is another pause .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Yes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Anxious , at a supreme tension , and now a little alarmed as to the decision .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>She has decided not to leave my house .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Adds .</stage>Yet !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Ever !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Losing his control .</stage>That 's a lie !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>I could n't believe it , either , when she told me . It was her first word to me to-day . I said , “ You are going to divorce me , ” and she answered , “ No . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>She 's sacrificing herself for some reason — her boy !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Never mind , she wo n't leave me ; I have her promise , and I 'll win back her love !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>You fool ! You can n't win her back ! She would never have loved me if you had n't disillusioned , dishonored her ! I 'm not worthy of her , but I 'll never dishonor her , and , please God , never disappoint her , and so I 'll keep her love .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Well , as to that , she decides to stay , leaving love out of the question .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>And you 'll accept that sacrifice ! You do n't even love her . You 're only thinking of yourself now . Love , real love , forgets itself . You , after having spoilt half her life , are willing to spoil the rest , for your own sake !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>No , for the boy 's sake , and her sake — to save a scandal — the world —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Interrupted .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Beside himself .</stage>Oh , damn the world ! It 's heaven and hell you 'd better think of . Scandal ! It could n't harm her , and the hurt it would do you is a small price to pay . Those whom God has joined — yes ! but it was the devil bound her to you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Here ! I 've had enough ! Look out !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Moves toward him .</stage>You look out — you sha n't rob her of her happiness . You — a drunkard ! A forger ! A thief !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>I 'd keep her now if only to spite you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Hah ! There spoke the true man in you ! Would to heaven the old days of duelling were back !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>A brave wish , as you know they 're not !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>They fight in other countries still for their love and honor , and I 'm ready here , now , if you are , with any weapons you choose !<stage>STERLING sneers .</stage>Sneer ! But will you fight ? We 'll find a place , and something to fight with , or fists if you 'd rather ! You would n't kill me before I 'd got you out of her way for good . Will you fight ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Coming closer to him .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>No !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Getting more and more enraged .</stage>If you lose , you go away , and set her free of your own will !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>No !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Losing entirely his self-control .</stage>What do you want to make you fight — will that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He gives him a stinging blow in the face .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Yes !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He springs toward WARDEN as RUTH and MASON enter Left . The two men stand rigid , WARDEN breathing heavily .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Blanche , may I bring in — where 's Blanche ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>Good morning , gentlemen .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>There is no response . WARDEN is with great difficulty restraining himself . His lips are compressed lightly and his hands clenched .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>What 's the trouble ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>

     <lg>
      <stage>Showing her relief and satisfaction in her face , turns to WARDEN .</stage>
      <l>You wo n't try to shake that resolve ?</l>

    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Unable to control himself .</stage>But I will ! I will — I tell you all ! I hardly know what I say or do ! But look out for me , I 'm desperate ! I 'm a torrent that 's only let loose since yesterday , and now all of a sudden you try to stop me ! But it 's too late ; I 've got my impetus ; the repressed passion of years is behind me ; nothing can stop me — and God keep me from doing the wrong thing ! I am determined to clear him out of the way of the happiness of the woman I love .<stage>To RUTH .</stage>Do you mean to say you approve of her decision ?<stage>RUTH turns her head ; he turns to MASON .</stage>Do you ?</p>

     <p>No .</p>

     <p><stage>Alone with STERLING .</stage>Go away and make your wife understand you are never coming back .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>But the loneliness , the misery , away — alone .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Kill them with hard work ; you have other heavy debts , you know .</l>
      <l>I came to see you about this business of your acknowledgments to Miss</l>
      <l>Godesby and Miss Hunter .</l>

    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Later , later . To-morrow I will decide —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He motions him away . MASON goes to him and puts his hand on his shoulder .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MASON</speaker>
     <p>Decide well —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He hesitates a moment and then goes out Right .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Watching him go .</stage>There 's not one soul in this world who cares for me , and it 's my own fault .<stage>RICHARD is heard upstairs again singing “ Once in Royal David 's City . ” STERLING lifts his head and listens .</stage>Yes , one little soul loves me , and it would be better for him , too , if I went away . I 'll go to sleep and see how I feel about it when I wake up .<stage>He moves the glass of water and takes out the box of tablets . He starts suddenly , but very slightly , and his muscles tighten .</stage>After all , why not end it all now , at once , without any more bother ?<stage>He looks in the box , and glances up questioningly ; then he remembers the fireplace where he threw the other tablets and looks across the room at the logs . He rises , goes over , and sees in the fireplace the twisted envelope which holds the other tablets . He bends over to pick it up ; he stops short .</stage>No ! Why should n't I try it , anyway ? She , herself , gives me the chance !<stage>He rings the electric bell , and walking away from the fireplace , takes up with a trembling hand the papers left by MASON ; he wipes the damp from his forehead with his handkerchief . To JORDAN , who enters Left .</stage>Light the fire quickly ; I feel cold .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He sinks into the arm-chair , weak from the mental strain .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LEONARD</speaker>
     <p>It 's very warm in the house , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Do as I tell you — light the fire .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LEONARD</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Looking for matches on the mantel , finds the box empty .</stage>
      <l>There are no matches , sir ; I must get one .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>No , do n't go — here — here —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He gives him a match from his own box . LEONARD notices the trembling hand and suppressed excitement of STERLING , and involuntarily glances up , but quickly looks back to his work and strikes a match . The match goes out .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LEONARD</speaker>
     <p>I shall need another match , please , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>With one in his fingers taken from his match-box , he alters his mind .</stage>I have no more .<stage>He puts away his match-box .</stage>Never mind the fire ; get me a pint bottle of champagne .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LEONARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a surreptitious side glance of curiosity .</stage>Very well , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out Left .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>That was funny ; that was very funny ! I wonder if it was accident , or if there 's such a thing as fatality .<stage>He goes to the fireplace and picks up the twisted envelope .</stage>If not now — perhaps some other time — who knows ?<stage>He thrusts the envelope in his vest pocket , and takes up the papers again from the table to look over them .</stage>I can n't read these things !<stage>Throwing them down .</stage>The words mean nothing to me !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>There is the sound outside of a cork being drawn . LEONARD enters with the champagne and a glass and places them beside STERLING .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LEONARD</speaker>
     <p>Shall I light the fire now , sir ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>No , never mind now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LEONARD</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out Left .</stage>
    <stage>STERLING half fills the glass with champagne . He takes out the box of tablets and counts aloud .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>One , two , three , four —<stage>He puts all in the glass , dropping them as he counts . He hesitates , then quickly drops in two more and drinks quickly . The glass is empty . He sits by the table thinking a moment , then lakes a piece of paper and makes ready his stylographic pen .</stage>Let me see ; can I make it seem accidental ; it would be so much less bother and trouble for them !<stage>He thinks a second , then writes .</stage>“ I have accidentally taken an overdose of my sleeping draught . I have tried to call some one , but it 's no use . I ask only one thing , that you forget all my sins , wipe out their memory with my name . I want my boy to change his name , too . ”<stage>He hesitates a moment , and then scratches that sentence heavily out .</stage>No , I wo n't say that .<stage>He waits a moment .</stage>God in heaven , what would n't I give for one friendly word just now ! Some one to sort of say good-by to me — take my hand — even a servant !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He looks about him , showing signs of drowsiness . The door Right bursts open . STERLING quickly hides the letter in his inside pocket as WARDEN comes in .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>My hat ! Where 's my hat !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He looks about for it .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quietly .</stage>Ned ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>My hat , I say ! Where 's my hat ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Looking .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Ned !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Something in his voice arrests WARDEN 'S attention .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>What ?<stage>He looks at him .</stage>What 's the matter —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Nothing — I 'm half asleep , that 's all — the reaction — I 'm worn out and I 've changed my mind —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>How do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>I 'm going away for good — that 's the best I can do ; I want you to forgive me — could you ? What do you say ? Forgive me for everything ! For the sake of the old schoolboy days —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>When are you going ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>To-day . Will you say good-by to me and wish me well on my journey ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Speaks without sympathy .</stage>You can count on me always to help you in any way I can . You can still retrieve a good deal if you 're strong enough .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>I know what a beastly friend I 've been , and yesterday was more than any man would stand , but forgive that , too , will you ? I 've always been a bad lot !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Goes to him and speaks , with the sympathy of a man for a child coming into his voice .</stage>No , a weak lot ; that 's been your ruin , Dickie . I 'll see you again before you go .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>No , I 'm going to sleep as long as I can now , and I do n't want any one to wake me up ; but when I do wake , I shall have other things to do . This is good-by .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Well , good luck !<stage>He starts to go . The two men look at each other , and finally STERLING gets the courage to hold out his hand . WARDEN hesitates a moment , then shakes it .</stage>Good luck !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out Left .</stage>
    <stage>STERLING , who has been growing more and more drowsy , as soon as he is alone , goes with difficulty to the door and locks it . He is so drowsy that he leans against the door for a moment ; then he starts to go back to the table , but is unable to get there and sinks on the sofa half way between the table and the door . His eyes close , but suddenly he starts violently and tries to rise , but cannot , crying out faintly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STERLING</speaker>
     <p>Good God — the money ! I forgot the money — who 'll pay my debts ? Ah , this is a fitting climax for my life — the weakest , dirtiest thing I 've done —<stage>He gets the letter from his pocket and holds it in his hand ; the light of the afternoon grows slowly dim , like his fading sight and senses . He murmurs twice in a faint , drowsy voice .</stage>Coward ! Coward !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>BLANCHE , in the hall outside Right , calls his name .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Dick !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>STERLING 'S body relaxes and sets . The letter drops from his lifeless hands .</stage>
    <stage>BLANCHE enters with RUTH , followed by RICHARD , who rides a stick with a horse 's head and wears a soldier 's cap .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RICHARD</speaker>
     <p>Merry Christmas , father !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Going toward the sofa .</stage>Dick !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RICHARD</speaker>
     <p>Merry Christmas , father !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Sh ! Father 's asleep .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They steal back toward the other door when WARDEN enters Right .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Oh , you are here ! I went down into the drawing-room where I left you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Sh !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She points to STERLING , who lies apparently asleep . They speak in lowered voices .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I have a message for you from him .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Looking at RICHARD and RUTH .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Who understands .</stage>Come , Richard , I have n't seen your tree yet .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She goes out Right with RICHARD .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>To BLANCHE .</stage>Give me your hand .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She does so wonderingly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Softly , with a man 's tenderness in his voice .</stage>He is going away for good .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p>Away ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>For good .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLANCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Slowly , withdrawing her hand .</stage>For good ?<stage>She looks over toward STERLING , and then back to WARDEN .</stage>What does he mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WARDEN</speaker>
     <p>We will know when he wakes . THE CURTAIN STEALS SOFTLY DOWN</p>
