    <head>Preface</head>
    <p n="1">Thoroughly to understand China , one must realize that it has for three hundred years cherished in its heart a deep and continually bleeding wound . When the country was conquered by the Manchus of Tartary , the ancient dynasty of the Mings was forced to yield the throne to the Tzin invaders , but the Chinese nation never ceased to mourn the ancient dynasty nor to hope for its restoration . Revolution is therefore a permanent thing in China — a fire which smoulders eternally , breaking into flame in one province only to be smothered and blaze out again presently in another .</p>
    <p n="2">No doubt the Yellow Empire is too immense to permit of complete understanding among the revolutionaries , or of collective effort to break off the Tartar yoke . Several times , nevertheless , the Chinese race has been near to victory . When , some twenty years ago , certain events , which Europe never really understood , brought about an upheaval in China , the revolutionaries , victorious for a time , proclaimed at Nang-King an emperor of Chinese blood and of the dynasty of the Mings . His name was Ron-Tsin-Tse , which means : The Final Flowering , and by the faithful his era was called Tai-Ping-Tien-Ko , which is as much as to say : The Empire of the Great Celestial Peace . He reigned seventeen years , concurrently with the Tartar Emperor at Pekin and almost within the shadow of that city .</p>
    <p n="3">Later , the authorities forced a complete suppression of his history : all records of it were confiscated and burned , and men were forbidden , under penalty of death , even to utter his name . Here , however , is the translation of a passage relating to him which occurs in a voluminous report addressed by the Tartar general Tsen-Konan-Wei , to the Emperor at Pekin :</p>
    <p n="4">“ When the revolutionaries rose in the province of Chan-Tung ( he says ) they possessed themselves of sixteen provinces and six hundred cities . Their guilty chief and his criminal friends had become really formidable . All their generals fortified themselves in the places they had taken , and not until they had stood three years of siege were we again Masters in Nang-King . At this time the rebel army numbered more than two hundred thousand men , but not one of them would surrender . The moment they perceived themselves lost they set fire to the palace and burned themselves alive . Many of the women hanged or strangled themselves , or threw themselves into the lakes in the gardens . However , I succeeded in making one young woman prisoner , and pressed her to tell me where the Emperor was . ‘ He is dead , ’ she replied ; ‘ vanquished , he poisoned himself . ’ But immediately the new Emperor was proclaimed in the person of his son , Hon-Fo-Tsen . She led me to the old Emperor 's tomb , which I ordered broken open . In it was found in fact the Emperor 's body , enveloped in a shroud of yellow silk embroidered with dragons . He was old , bald , and had a white mustache . I caused his body to be burned and his ashes to be thrown to the winds . Our soldiers destroyed all that remained within the walls : there were three days and nights of killing and pillage . However , one troop of several thousands of rebels , very well-armed , succeeded in escaping from the city , dressed in the costumes of our dead , and it is to be feared that the new Emperor was able to escape with them . ”</p>
    <p n="5">This Emperor , Hon-Fo-Tsen , who , in fact , did succeed in fleeing from Nang-King , was looked upon by the real Chinese as their legitimate sovereign , and his descendants in secret no doubt reigned after him uninterruptedly .</p>
    <p n="6">Several years ago a very remarkable man , who seemed to incarnate in himself the new China , dreamed of a pacific and genuine reconciliation of the two inimical races . ( He had many dreams indeed : one of them , for instance , that of founding the United States of the World . ) He conceived the almost unrealizable project of converting to his ideas the Emperor at Pekin himself and of securing his help to reform China without the spilling of any blood . His name was Kan-You-Wey . To get near the Emperor he opened a school at Pekin in 1889 .</p>
    <p n="7">Many rumors , though very conflicting ones , were in circulation concerning the personality of this invisible Emperor Kwang-Su , kept as he was under strict guardianship , like a captive in the heart of his palace and so unknown to everyone . Some versions declared him alert , well-read , interested in modern things ; others represented him as feeble in body and spirit , given to excesses and incapable of action .</p>
    <p n="8">Kan-You-Wey would believe only in the favorable version : he knew besides What the ministers of the Dowager Regent were worth , masters with her of the Imperial power . He pitied the Imperial victim . His whole heart turned toward his sovereign because he was unhappy . How could he reach him in his quadrupled walls ? How win the attention of his melancholy idol ? Kan-You-Wey ten times renewed his attempts , with the zeal of an apostle , and succeeded finally , in 1898 , thanks to one of his disciples , in putting before the Emperor a memorial that he had prepared for him .</p>
    <p n="9">Then the phantom-sovereign roused himself . Much struck with these insurgent ideas , he wanted them explained to him in detail , and gave an audience to the reformer . He surrendered at once to the influence of this great spirit , made him his minister , intimate and confidant ; and , sustained by his counsel , achieved at last the control of his affairs .</p>
    <p n="10">It is at this moment of the reign of Kwang-Su that our play takes place . The Emperor himself is the hero , and Kan-You-Wey figures in it under the name of Fount-in-the-Forest .</p>

     <p>You ? You have witnessed such a sight ?</p>

     <p>What was it ? Tell us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HUMPBACK</speaker>
     <p>Well , it was yesterday , after sundown . The other gardeners had just gone away ; I had not yet finished my task , but remained to polish one of those great marble lions , at the Gateway of State . I was working all unsuspicious , when suddenly I heard the great drum and the clanging of the bell , and I saw the watchers descend from their tower to open the great gate . The guards and generals and ministers were all running . I heard it said that the new arrival was the most important of all the invited guests , the Viceroy of the Southern Provinces . How could I make my escape in the midst of all these wonderful personages ? It was impossible ! I hid behind one of the huge paws of the lion and made myself very small . No one took any notice of me —— and I saw , I saw through the pierced globe , you know , which the lion holds in his clutch ——.</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FIR-SAPLING</speaker>
     <p>You saw the Viceroy of the South enter with his retinue ?——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HUMPBACK</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I saw ! Oh ! such costumes of silk and gold ! Such horses shining with gems ! Such banners ! And some terrible faces , too , some glances awful in their pride !—— But when he came , oh ! then I understood that besides him all the others counted for naught . He was pale , with a very weary air , on a horse led by two attendants —— His costume was simple , but seemed richer than all the others —— He was so imposing that my heart would no longer beat in my breast , and it seemed to me that if only he turned his unseeing eyes towards me , I should drop dead .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FIR-SAPLING</speaker>
     <p>Ah , was it like that ? If one feels like that for no more than a Viceroy , how would it be if one were gazed upon by the Emperor himself ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HUMPBACK</speaker>
     <p>But I assure you , no one who has not seen him can ——</p>

     <p><stage>reading</stage>On this holy day on which our Empress , laying aside her mourning for her illustrious Husband , is about to take up the power in the name Of Her son , in defiance of that usurper who for three hundred years has held all China under his yoke : An order to all high Dignitaries of the Palace , to the Masters of the Ceremonies , to the Grand Secretaries of State , to the Ministers , Warriors , and Princes , to the Guardians of the Imperial Seal ! Let them hold themselves in readiness before the last watch of night and gather together all the precious objects which they have in their keeping so as to place them , according to the due rites , on the six golden tables in the Palace of Great Purity . Let the Master-in-Chief of the Music place orchestras and singers in the galleries and in the Throne-room . As soon as the last watch shall have sounded , let the Astrologer go to inform Her Majesty the Empress that the chosen hour has come when she must repair to the Temple of her Ancestors to offer the prescribed sacrifices to the August Shades . Her Majesty will be attended only by the Princesses and Her Ladies-in-Waiting .</p>

     <speaker>ARROW-BEARER</speaker>
     <p><stage>continuing to read</stage>From the Temple of Ancestors to the Palace of Great Purity , let all Dignitaries , Officers , Guards , Secretaries form up in a line on either side of the road along which the Empress will pass in a palanquin , ornamented with dragons and phoenixes , to the foot of the staircase leading to the throne-room , where the grand ceremony of investiture will take place .</p>

     <speaker>GOLDEN LOTUS</speaker>
     <p>Will women be present at that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARROW-BEARER</speaker>
     <p>Yes , the Princesses and the Ladies-in-Waiting will form the retinue of the Empress and group themselves about her .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLDEN LOTUS</speaker>
     <p>Ah ! I was not sure —— It was that particularly which I wished to know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARROW-BEARER</speaker>
     <p>The young Emperor will be close to the brave mother who is to reign in his name . Reign , you know how ! Reign in mystery , in anguish , faced by insurmountable difficulties ——</p>

     <speaker>GOLDEN LOTUS</speaker>
     <p>How many hearts beat for Her , how many strong arms are ready to defend Her !</p>

     <p>Have all the invited guests arrived at the Palace ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARROW-BEARER</speaker>
     <p>I believe so . The most powerful of all , the Viceroy of the South , has been lodged not far from here , in the Pavilion of Limpid Fountains . If the bushes were not so leafy you would be able to see the roof of his residence from your Pavilion .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLDEN LOTUS</speaker>
     <p>One question more , my Lord . Does not some new danger threaten us ? Dark rumours have reached us —— Are our reconquered Provinces well garrisoned ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARROW-BEARER</speaker>
     <p>Alas ! even during the hours of joy , anxiety assails us . Alas that , when the delicious perfume of a flower caresses us , we must watch with dread the storm which is always threatening on the horizon . The gazelle had a little respite because the tiger was wounded . If he recovers , he will immediately begin again the pursuit of his prey .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLDEN LOTUS</speaker>
     <p>What is the meaning of that allusion ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARROW-BEARER</speaker>
     <p>That the Tartar Emperor , who reigns at Peking and considers us , the dispossessed Chinese , as rebels , has just been vanquished in the war which the dangerous Western Barbarians made against him . With great difficulty he has obtained peace , and he has not yet recovered from the effects of his defeat .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLDEN LOTUS</speaker>
     <p>Ah ! yes , the rumor of that war came to us . But what was the cause of it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TRANQUIL BEAUTY</speaker>
     <p>How politics interest her !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEARL</speaker>
     <p>Yes ! when that young man is her teacher .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARROW-BEARER</speaker>
     <p>The cause of it was peculiar . A Prince , kinsman to the Tartar usurper , conceived the foolish idea of mustering an army of bandits to hurl upon the hated Christians in the north of China . But the horde , once let loose , got out of hand . It rushed against the barbarian strangers , whose presence has for a long time been tolerated in the neighbourhood of the Palace . Then the armies of the Western nations came to sack Peking , whence the Tartar Emperor fled with his entire Court .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLDEN LOTUS</speaker>
     <p>Doubtless it is unhappy for us that the usurper has made peace ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ARROW-BEARER</speaker>
     <p>Who knows ? Perhaps China might have fallen under a more evil dominion still .</p>

     <stage>The TARTAR EMPEROR , disguised as the Viceroy of the South , with FOUNT-IN-THE-FOREST , his minister .</stage>
    </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FOUNT</speaker>
     <p>I see no one —— Your Majesty may come forward .</p>

     <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
     <p>Your Majesty ! Do you wish to ruin me ?</p>

     <p>Oh ! Sire .</p>

     <p>Again !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>When we are alone , I cannot refrain ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
     <p>You must —— Behind those blinds , probably spies are watching us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FOUNT</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Eaves-droppers , rather . That is the Pavilion of</l>
      <l>Ladies-in-Waiting .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
     <p>The Pavilion of the Ladies-in-Waiting —— So there are also Ladies-in-Waiting here ? In very truth , it seems to me that I am dreaming . Yet I knew what I came hither to find that after three centuries of reign the Emperors of my dynasty had never succeeded in subduing the secret resistance of the conquered — I knew that . That in the Southern Provinces the rebels had never yet bowed the head , aye , I knew that . That Nanking was their capital and that here a descendant of the Mings had even reigned . For more than seventeen years before being crushed by our armies , of all that I was aware —— But I thought this phantom empire was more mysterious , more hidden in the dark , and here I find a palace as beautiful as mine , with guards , dignitaries , ministers , a ceremonial regulated as at my own Court —— Our Empire is too large it seems , to be governed by one head alone —— I wished to see with my own eyes . I was prepared for all surprises , yet this is beyond me .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He sits down on a bench under a tree in full bloom .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FOUNT</speaker>
     <p>What is more surprising still is that you are here unknown to all ; here in the midst of your implacable enemies , and clad in the fashion of three hundred years ago .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
     <p>It is a happy coincidence that this Viceroy of the South whose place I have taken is of my build —— What can he be thinking of this adventure , in the ship where he is now held a prisoner for me ? What can he imagine , do you suppose ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FOUNT</speaker>
     <p>Anything — except the truth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
     <p>Yet if he should escape , would I not be lost indeed ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FOUNT</speaker>
     <p>My heart feels as though in a vice . Are you not lost in any case ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
     <p>Silence ! After all , what have I to risk ? My life ? Under the shadow of that throne from which they would banish me , is not life an unending agony ? With what crushing weight do the slow hours fall upon me . Who can describe the horror of that indolent stagnation , of that idle solitude ? Oh ! the rage which consumes the soul , when one is the Master and yet has no power ! If I find death here , I shall be a thousand times happier for having come . All my unhappy existence down to the present has not been worth as much to me as these last few days of flight and travel , this rapture of escape , for a time , from that grey , silky web wherein I am a prisoner . Oh ! to work , to work in the sunshine , to work like a man , to attempt some daring act , which , if I die , will at least remain behind to honour my memory .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FOUNT</speaker>
     <p>You are wonderful , you are noble , you are fearless . But I , who am as nothing , I have the right to tremble .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
     <p>It is you , however , who have awakened my spirit , who have aroused it from its deadly torpor ; it is you who have inspired me with will and strength . Have you not approved of my project ? Have you not found noble , and worthy of a sage , the dream which carried me away .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FOUNT</speaker>
     <p><stage>kneeling before the EMPEROR</stage>I cried aloud with enthusiasm , I wept with emotion when I grasped your sublime thought —— But it is an impossible dream , and the wish to realise it is a madness as generous as it is vain . I fear for you , Sire , my well beloved Master , I fear !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
     <p>You fear what ? Up to to-day has not my plan worked out as if by magic .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FOUNT</speaker>
     <p>Up to to-day , yes , I cannot deny it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
     <p>My departure from the Palace , which seemed so perilous — not an obstacle ! You , my dear minister , enter your official palanquin , I was at your side in the costume of your Secretary ! I smiled , you remember , like a schoolboy playing truant . My manner was so gay as to frighten you .—— And your poor little secretary , your pupil , as dear to you as a son , consented to take my place in my bed with its funereal silk draperies , in that sepulchral chamber , railed and walled in again and again , where one stifles with the perfumes which are too sweet . If I come through safe , what can I do in recognition of this boy 's tremendous devotion , who acted as substitute for the martyr which I was , who entered into the mummied body of an Emperor of China ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FOUNT</speaker>
     <p>Will he know how to play the part which he assumed ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
     <p>Oh ! it is an easy part , that of sovereign in my sad , closed room . One sleeps , reads , meditates , and keeps one 's self from doing more . I have made use of the weapon which is so often used against me . I have been accused of being ill when I am not so . This time it is I that pretend . Who will dare to doubt ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FOUNT</speaker>
     <p>And the doctor who is taking care of the mock Emperor — are you sure of his fidelity ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
     <p>My doctor ? What interest would he have in betraying me ? He thinks I am engaged in some affair of gallantry and I have promised him a province if my absence is not discovered . He is watching his patient carefully and has strictly forbidden anyone to go near him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FOUNT</speaker>
     <p>That is capital !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
     <p>Even in my city of Peking there is no risk of my being recognised , since none of my subjects have even seen my face . Flight is made easy for an invisible emperor ! And once on the ship — so freighted with your anxiety , do you remember ? what rapture it was to fly through space , light as the cloudlets of smoke which followed in our track !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FOUNT</speaker>
     <p>It is true , the kidnapping of the Viceroy and his companions was the more dangerous feat , but our sailors managed it marvellously . The immortals are with us , your Majesty .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
     <p>Poor little Viceroy ! As the escort who came to greet him had never seen him , nothing was simpler than that I should be taken for him . I told you , Fount-in-the-Forest , that all must be as simple as child'shYpppHeNplay !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FOUNT</speaker>
     <p>Sire ! Did you compose novels of adventure they would be more interesting even than those of the famous Lo Kwan-chung .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
     <p>Well , you see , they left me but two things in my splendid solitude ; love and opium . Opium exalts the imagination , and I have had plenty of leisure to dream about my plans .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FOUNT</speaker>
     <p>I plan out the future in my writings — prophetically , perhaps , but then I leave to the generations that are to come the duty of fulfilling my prophesies . You , Sire , are offering your own blood as a sacrifice to assuage unconquerable hate . The Immortal gods shall bow to you as to their equal : but those on whom you wish to heap your kindness will destroy you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
     <p>Who knows ? Hatred often yields to love .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FOUNT</speaker>
     <p>Not such immemorial hatred as this . Nothing has softened it , and for these three hundred years it has not even known the weakness of a love affair . Never has a Tartar married a Chinese woman , never has a Chinese loved a Tartar woman . During the three years since you issued the decree authorising marriages between the two races , none have availed themselves of the permission .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
     <p>Yes , there has been one marriage ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FOUNT</speaker>
     <p>One marriage ! One of your courtiers , to please you , married the daughter of one of your ministers ; and do you recall the number of favours by which you have had to repay that act of sacrifice ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
     <p>You are , however , a Chinese , and I believe that you love me a little .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FOUNT</speaker>
     <p>On me alone you have shed the light of your soul ; and I , moreover , have cast away the prejudices which fetter life . I love you and I admire you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
     <p>Well , that is my recompense ——</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
     <p>My trouble is mixed with sweetness —— Would it not seem that Heaven approves of me and will be my ally ? This child comes to me , defends me , is uneasy because of my pallor , and gives me his plaything —— Ah ! how precious to me is this little gift .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FOUNT</speaker>
     <p>Yes ! I felt with you the emotion of that chance encounter —— But let calm descend upon your soul . You will need all your composure not to betray yourself during the ceremony of the robing , for this time you are not playing the leading part . Do not forget the three obeisances , the nine complete prostrations . You cannot accustom yourself to bend the knee to another .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
     <p>But I know all these fine points of etiquette better than anyone , for am I not condemned always to see men prostrated at my feet , touching the ground with their foreheads ?</p>

     <p>Let us return ! It is time , since you must rehearse your speech . Above all , Sire , change nothing in it . I so much fear that you will betray : yourself by some imprudent words .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
     <p>It seems too commonplace , that speech of mine —— - Since I have seen her , Her , I must compose another ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FOUNT</speaker>
     <p>Oh ! no , I beg you . You might distract yourself , break off short , or , more likely , let yourself be carried away beyond measure .</p>

     <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
     <p>You may prepare an opium-pipe for me . Then my mind will work with more ease and clearness .</p>

     <speaker>FOUNT</speaker>
     <p>Oh ! you promised me to give up that poison . You know full well that it is the complete destruction of your energies and your will . The exaltation which results from — it , you know very well with what depression you must pay for that later on .</p>

The EMPRESS and the throne upon which she is seated appear in profile . The LITTLE EMPEROR is seated near her . The throne is raised on a number of steps ; the LADIES-IN-WAITING are behind the EMPRESS , fanning her with large , feathered fans . The bodyguard is placed on the steps of the throne , and each man is holding a censer containing Tibetan incense . All the dignitaries and officials are standing , in order of rank . At the back , across a colonnade , open-air galleries may be seen , in which are musicians and singers . The palanquin of the EMPRESS , with its dragons of gold , is also visible . Outside the crowd can be vaguely seen and heard . Opposite the throne , on a platform , are some dancers costumed as armed warriors , standing motionless . Everyone is standing , with the sole exception of the EMPRESS and her little son .</p>

He conducts him to a golden table at the back of the stage . The guardian of the Seals , after having bent the knee , takes from that table the great seal of the Empire , which lies on a large salver . The master of the ceremonies then conducts him to the foot of the throne and withdraws . The guardian of the seals bends the knee and offers the seal to the FAITHFUL PRINCE . When the FAITHFUL PRINCE has taken it , the guardian kneels before the throne , makes three prostrations , rises , and withdraws backwards . The FAITHFUL PRINCE bends the knee , and holding the salver with both hands , offers it to the Empress , then he rises .</stage>

Love the people . Exalt the soul . Cultivate the sciences . Honour merit . Listen to wise counsels . Lessen taxes . Mitigate the laws . Spare the treasury . Avoid the allurements of the senses ! Obeying these commands , one is sure to follow in the right path . But one must advance along this road without turnings aside or falterings . Oh ! our Sovereign , be attentive and anxious , as though each hour of the day you carried a chalice filled to the brim with water not one drop must be spilled . Act thus , and then your conduct will be just and your dynasty endure eternally ——</p>

     <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
     <p>Enlighten me , Oh , Divine Reason ! Spirits of my ancestors , enter into my spirit , strengthen my weakness , embolden my heart !—— Will these womanly hands have the power to carry on high this sceptre , which is still too heavy for the frail hands of my little son ? At least they shall not tremble ! They shall hold it with an unrelaxing grasp , which death alone will have the power to unlock . And you will aid me , all of you , my faithful ones , you will aid me with your advice , with your wisdom and your courage . The name allotted by the Book of Centuries to the last descendant of the Bright Dynasty is : Perfect Harmony Realised . But alas ! it seems a faraway dream , this harmony announced in the ancient days of our history , and longed for with many a prayer by our bruised hearts . Instead of this dream of the future , we have the terrible present with its uncertainty , instability , and war ! And that Empire , of which you have proclaimed me sovereign , we must reconquer day by day , tearing it fragment by fragment from the grasp of the ravisher . Ah , how much bloodshed have we seen in the past three centuries ! It is a stream purple with blood , on which floats the vessel freighted with our noble hopes ! It tosses about , it battles with the tempest , this vessel with the reddened timbers , but it cannot suffer shipwreck , for it stands for justice and right . Some day it shall drop anchor in a peaceful port , the Bright Dynasty shall be re-established for ever — and all our beloved dead , whose bodies are scattered throughout the length and breadth of the land , whose spirits abide in the clouds above , all our unnumbered dead shall then have their magnificent revenge and receive the reward of their martyrdom . Like everyone of you here assembled , I dedicate my life to that sacred cause ; but it suffices not to die without regret , we must fight to the last , we must defend ourselves with our final breath , that our death may be fruitful . To reconquer our country , to break the yoke which dishonours it , let us make our hearts fearless , our souls implacable . No pity nor mercy for the Tartar ! May our heroic wrath never lessen , nor our holy hate be appeased . Toward all other living men we know our duties : good will , compassion , charity . Whoever these men may be , whether they come from the north or the south , or from the covetous west , to all who shall call themselves our friends , let us extend a brotherly hand in accordance with that immemorial tradition , which only our invaders have violated . I swear to you , oh , shades of my ancestors , and to you , all my well beloved subjects , I swear to keep severe watch upon myself , to take good care that I am not remiss in any of my duties , I swear to be attentive and anxious , as though I carried in my hands a chalice filled to the brim with water , of which not one drop must be spilled . I swear to hold my head high against the threats of the future , to submit with resignation to cruel fate , and not even to move an eye-lash if the sword be lifted against me .</p>

    <stage>The Master of Ceremonies approaches the TARTAR EMPEROR and leads him towards the Throne . The little EMPEROR of Nanking exchanges glances of recognition with the TARTAR EMPEROR . He shows him a Golden Dragon , which is hanging on a chain round his neck , while the TARTAR EMPEROR shows him the shuttlecock hidden under his robe . The EMPRESS , surprised , questions her son with a look . The child smiles mysteriously and moves closer to her .

     <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Divine Majesty ! I , your slave , and at this moment one of the first dignitaries of your Court , why am I so insignificant a thing ? Why is my will barren , when it is so eager to make a path both smooth and glorious for your feet ? Oh ! at my powerlessness to crush the menace of fate , what a tumult of desire and righteous rage disturbs my soul ! And yet the celestial radiance of Your presence illumines and inspires me . The dazzling light which emanates from Your Majesty 's presence seems to colour the clouds on the far horizon , to pierce the shadows , and I see You there , in the great city of the Tsings . I see you seated and all powerful , on the very Throne of the TARTAR EMPEROR ; the immense empire , undivided and at peace , extending under your feet like a carpet of honour . No ! destiny cannot be cruel to you ; before Your sacred presence , its weapons will be dashed to pieces . Do not the laws of Heaven and earth seem always to yield to certain superior beings ? Do you remember the beautiful favourite , who formerly captivated one of your sovereign ancestors ? When the day arrived on which , having forfeited the Imperial favour , she was given into the keeping of the executioners , she gazed upon them calmly , and as they brandished their swords against her , she smiled sweetly — her only defence . Then they threw their weapons at her feet , for no one had the courage to extinguish that radiant smile ——<stage>A murmur of astonishment makes itself felt throughout the crowd .</stage>And so you will disarm destiny , and your most deadly enemies will bend the knee before you ——<stage>So saying , he bends his knee</stage>The EMPRESS<stage>After a moment of astounded silence , without rising from the Throne</stage>Thank you , my noble subject ! Your bold words have surprised us , but have also charmed us . Moreover , the tragic circumstances of our investiture make excuse for passionate thoughts and exceptional speech . Your prophetic vision has touched us very deeply —— Thanks to you ! Thanks to all !</p>

Its curved roofs are ornamented with monsters and small bells . Leading to the terraces , in the middle of the stage , is an “ imperial stair , ” an inclined plane of white marble , on which an immense dragon is carved in bas-relief ; and also , on either side of this , two identical marble staircases bordered by bronze and jade animals and huge censers on marble brackets . Numerous symmetrical kiosks flank the pavilion on this side and that with curved roofs similar to those of the pavilion , ornamented with small bells and monsters .</stage>

     <stage>EMPRESS</stage>
     <stage>Halting at the top of the Imperial stair ] Oh , Night of enchantment ! Pure light and silence cool !—— Oh , scintillating stars , envelope me in your rays ! And thou , pale moon , shroud me in thy blue light ; calm my soul , cool my fever ! [ She commences her descent down the “ Imperial Stair , ” two of her attendants following , one by the staircase on the right , the other by the staircase on the left , regulating their steps according to those of the EMPRESS in the middle . ] That dream , that strange dream which has aroused me from my sleep , I still feel the terror of it —— [ Lowering her voice ] The terror and the charm . [ To her attendants ] Let the astrologer be called at once , that he may discover the meaning of this dream and explain it without dissembling . Listen carefully to my words . I was about to become the prey of a serpent with shining scales ,— already he was twining about me and slowly choking me with his chilly coils . Fascinated by his steady gaze , I had not the force to struggle ; enervated , inert , I surrendered myself , with no repugnance against death . With fear and suffering a languor that was almost a delight was mingled —— A supreme effort of the will , however , extricated me from his grasp , and suddenly aroused from sleep and dreams I found myself regretting those deadly coils which had imprisoned me —— What can this dream portend ? [ To the women ] Report what I have told you to the astrologer . Let him question the Unknown , and give me his response here without delay . Go at once ! [ Two of the Attendants depart at this command . The EMPRESS continues to descend slowly . She is alone in the middle of the Imperial stair , which is very long , and whose white surface seems sown with tiny glistering spangles . ] How the dew sparkles on the marble footpath ! It seems like a carpet of stars . But as I walk I put out their light , and my trailing gown changes the little glistening drops into a pool of water , which soaks the hem of my robe . [ She continues to descend . ] Why is there ever before my eyes the image of that man whom I saw this morning for the first time ? Why , on this day , when so many heavy duties have devolved upon my weakness , can I recall only that deep and ardent gaze , which met mine with such sovereign audacity ? Why was I no more offended by that gaze than by the rays of the kindly sun that beat upon my palace ? He found me beautiful , and his admiration for me shone like an ornament more precious than the Imperial Phoenix of my head-dress . How well I understood , when he prostrated himself before me , with what feelings he threw himself at my feet —— And my son exchanged glances of recognition with him ! How came he to know him ? Why did I not even dare to ask him , as though to speak of that man to my own child were criminal ? Oh , kindly powers of the night , spirits of my deified ancestors who are about me in the air , august shades to whom I have rendered homage in your golden temples , come to my aid , gather about your unworthy and feeble daughter ! That man , that stranger in my path , on such a day ! Oh , divinities from whom I am descended , take from my soul the very remembrance of him . In a solemn vow I have renounced my earthly personality . Nothing of myself belongs to me . Daughter of Heaven , Empress and Regent , I am claimed entirely by my more than human mission —— Help me to triumph over the weaknesses which were the charm of life . Aid me to forget that there are flowers and pearls and perfumes , grant that I may lose consciousness of the fact that love is the only realm of woman , and beauty her true power . May my breast from henceforth be only the marble prison of my frozen heart ! Should it revolt and wish to beat again , may my will become its stern gaoler ! Aid me , oh , come down , pure spirits of the air ! Make me as unyielding as the goddesses of jade , who keep their eyes lowered that they may not see the things of this world !</stage>

Why should he appear to me in that hostile and terrible form ? No , no ! in a soul that has eyes like that treachery cannot flourish —— It cannot be he —— and yet I was carried away by that icy embrace . Who else then , in the world could it be ?</p>

My son , it must be —— Ah , yes , that it is ; my son !—— To shelter him , he said , to hide him , to send him far away , perhaps , from this palace that is threatened on all sides ; to separate myself from him in this grave danger — that is what is now demanded of me ?—— Still more agony and sacrifice ! And it is I who am expected to guide a whole people , when I lack the force to guide myself —— Oh you women who can lean on a strong supporting arm , who can depend for help upon the advice of a manly and farseeing mind ! Oh you wives who find in the heart of your husbands a refuge in your weakness !

     <sp>
      <speaker>FOUNT</speaker>
      <p>I do not think so . More likely the leaders of a conspiracy , against Nanking , perhaps to take it by surprise . We must leave here as soon as possible . All is in readiness , the horses are saddled , the vessel under steam —— You wished to see this palace with your own eyes . You have succeeded , now let us depart .</p>

      <p>Depart before having seen her for a last time ? Oh , no . Nothing could make me give up that happiness , which has come to be for me the most desirable thing in the world .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <p>That region is the most faithfully rebellious of the whole Empire , and is so far away that the orders for its repression are lost before they reach it . The inhabitants refuse to pay the tax levied by the Tartars and of their own accord deposit the money in our coffers .</p>

      <speaker>FAITHFUL PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>Perhaps you would like to be near the throne , in order to obtain a higher rank , more in accordance with your merits . Make use of my influence to support your request ——</p>

      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <p>I am the slave of her Majesty , ready to serve her in any position in which she may wish to employ me , but I ask for nothing , and the good opinion which Your Excellence has of my merits is to me the most acceptable recompense .</p>

      <speaker>FAITHFUL PRINCE</speaker>
      <p><stage>To the EMPRESS</stage>I venture to suggest to your Majesty that it might be better perhaps to imprison these men in a dungeon . We do not know who they are , nor of how great importance in the eyes of the enemy . What secrets might we not indeed extract from these two !——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p>What ! After what they have done , you would have them see the light of another day ?—— remember that they have dared to lay a hand on the sacred person of him in whom lives all our hope ; they have bruised his neck , frail as a stem of a flower . To kidnap him as hostage , they said ! How do I know that they did not rather mean to kill my child .</p>

      <p>No , it is too much , as they did not kill me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p>But they desired your death . The sentence is too lenient . And see , I spared them the torture-chamber —— Now , I shall never again dare to be away from you . No , not even for a minute , my priceless jewel , shall you again be out of my sight .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FAITHFUL PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>My Sovereign , how it pains me to be forced to tear your heart by telling you what we believe to be your painful duty , we to whose advice your Majesty deigns to listen . For many days , we have been resolved to speak , and yet we shrank from the ungrateful task . But to-day the danger is too pressing .</p>

      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p>“ Let the precious torch which shall illumine the future be placed beyond the reach of the wind . ” Thus spoke the astrologer . Yes , the blind man did see into the invisible . Thus is the mystery of his words explained ——!</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>FAITHFUL PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>We must obey the oracle . Misfortune foreseen can often be avoided . Winged Prince , and you Veiled-Light , sage councillors , does your opinion coincide with mine .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WINGED PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>It is the same in every point .</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>FAITHFUL PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>And all you , noble chiefs , wise men of letters , dignitaries , are you too of the opinion that we must send the young Emperor away .<stage>All nod their heads affirmatively without speaking .</stage>And not to-morrow , not even this evening alas — for each moment the danger increases —— We must act at once , if your Majesty consents to the sacrifice .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p>Oh ! You place me in a circle of fire , which you narrow again and again , far too quickly . But where are the Tartar armies , now ? Not yet beneath our walls , surely . We are not besieged ! The roads are still open ——<stage>She presses her son to her breast .</stage>Leave him with me just another day , at least give me time to find the necessary strength to bear this new affliction —— I am the Empress , yes , but I am also a mother —— One does not take a child from its mother as one plucks a flower from its stem —— Wait !——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FAITHFUL PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>Wait , my Sovereign ! But will not your despair be infinitely more intense should harm come to his Majesty because of a weak tenderness ? Think of the turmoil of a siege , the horror and the risk of battle ! Let us thank Heaven for giving us time to place our young Master in safety . As soon as the danger is over , he will return to you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p>Oh , do not speak of return to lessen my distress , as you would comfort a child !—— Let us not talk of the future , which is black and cloudy —— But Wisdom has spoken , and my rebellion is over . I shall have the strength to submit .<stage>To the child , whom she holds still pressed close against her .</stage>My son , you must go away from me for a little while —— Ah , tears fill my eyes at the idea . But when I think of keeping you in this palace , in the midst of such terrible dangers , anguish crushes my heart —— My best beloved , you must go .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>THE CHILD</speaker>

You remain here , my mother , and where you remain there I must be too .—— - Leave my mother on account of the Tartars ? I do not want to ! You all hear me . I do not want to .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p>My son ! You will show greater courage in saying good-bye to me . And you must prove yourself worthy of your noble , your more than human lot . Remember that you are not an ordinary child . Under your delicate flesh , in the fine network of your veins , flows the blood of divinity . The Bright Dynasty has no representative but you alone . Oh , my best beloved ! You are the son of Heaven !</p>

      <p>Raise up your face , do not turn it down , dazzled by the bright name of your ancestors . Already you must be master of your feelings .

       <p>He was imprisoned on a ship , but no harm came to him , and he was treated with every consideration —— - His letter explains how he escaped .</p>

       <speaker>WINGED PRINCE</speaker>
       <p>The Viceroy sent this courier in all haste ; he awaits orders to come and prostrate himself at the foot of the throne and sue for pardon .</p>

       <speaker>FAITHFUL PRINCE</speaker>
       <p>Still to the Viceroy of the South , to the real , one we may trust him . His devotion of ten years has stood all tests . So we must now march to meet him , and without losing an hour he must re-trace his steps toward Yunnan with his precious charge . To this end the start must be made instantly , so that the two escorts may meet before nightfall .<stage>To WINGED PRINCE</stage>Prince , until further orders , remain with the Emperor .

      <sp>
       <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
       <p>The horsemen have returned —— The fugitives have been seen , the man and his accomplice . They were riding horses which devoured the ground . One of those swift ships such as are used by the Western Barbarian was awaiting them at the water 's edge . It is bearing them along at present with the speed of lightning . All pursuit would be futile .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
       <p>I was prepared for that —— He would not permit himself to be captured like an ordinary fugitive !—— No , I knew that he would carry away with him the mystery which he was pleased to keep up here .</p>

       <p>Ah , no , leave me .

Never , do you hear ? I feel it , I know it ! Since we are above ordinary beings , may Heaven be just to us and give us superhuman strength ! Why have we hearts like other people , and anguish which breaks them ?—— Ah , the very beggar-women in rags in the street are less miserable ! No handsome spy comes to them , to make their souls falter , and then flees-and after that their children are not taken away from them !—— Your Empress would rather be a beggar , hungry and cold , but clasping her little one to her breast —— - Yes , a beggar I tell you , who holds out her hand to passers-by as she sits on the steps of a temple !——<stage>Sobbing , she throws herself on the terrace steps .</stage></p>

In the middle of the stage is a funeral pile of scaffolding and fagots . At the back , to the right , the crenellated wall continues ; terraces are visible and in the far distance the outline of the palace stands out in relief against the sky , yellow in the setting sun .

     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p>The rites , ah , the rites ! You see what attention I have paid to the rites , I , the daughter of the Mings , the daughter of Heaven and the Invisible —— I am here in the midst of my soldiers . I am fighting like them !—— And it is he , your phantom Emperor , who dares to send me a message ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <p>With a message of pardon one always dares ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p>Say rather that a message of pardon is the last message which may be sent when it is from him and concerns me !—— So the Tartars dare to offer pardon !—— You have just passed through my city of Nanking and you have seen ? It is glorious , is it not , their work ?——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <p>Alas ! yes , I have seen with horror ,—— but I can swear to you by my life that such were not the orders which were given by my Sovereign .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p>Ah ! a Sovereign then , who has not the force wherewith to command obedience !—— So others have told me that before —— I still hate him with that ineradicable race-hatred which you know , to which now contempt is added . Oh , that Emperor who smokes opium in his mummy 's palace , while his hordes of soldiers at their own free will go through the provinces , leaving red tracks behind and charnel-houses for the vultures ! And if the impossible were to happen and I were to humiliate myself sufficiently to accept his pardon , who would warrant me after all — since he is not obeyed ? Amid that army of wild beasts which was here awhile ago and will return soon to shout for our death , who could enforce the order of pardon of your phantom Emperor ?—— Who , I ask ?</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <p>I !</p>

      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p>You !<stage>More gently and in some agitation .</stage>You ! Perhaps in very truth you might , for you seem to be one of those whom one dare not disobey . Moreover you have the superb audacity to reappear at this moment ! But if the loyalty which I read in your eyes does not deceive me , cease the game which you are playing , and this time answer —— - Who are you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <p>Who am I ? Up to now nothing ! Inexistent as a vaporous cloud ! Nothing ! But to-morrow perhaps everything , if you so wish it . To-morrow everything and radiating at your side like a sun in the blue ether ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p><stage>Drawing back</stage>Ah , you remember all too well my recent indulgence toward your enigmas . Amid the perfume of incense , amid pomp and luxury , I betrayed the weakness of a woman . To-day , no ; you find me stronger and more stern , precisely because I am defeated , and know that I must die .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <p><stage>Bowing before her</stage>Oh , Sovereign , never were you more sacred to me Do not be offended by my words and for a short time still allow me my mask and my mystery . Hear only this : A fortnight ago , when I left that palace where I saw you in all your Imperial splendour , I hastened to Peking to request of that Emperor whom you hate that he would stop this horrible war . On the way I learned that our Tartar armies were marching with lightning speed , and I turned back as quick as my ship and horses could take me , to give to them myself the order for peace . I have the right to do so . See , here is the seal which gives me full power in the name of Tsings . As you have said , I am one of those whom men dare not disobey ; at least , not face to face , when I speak —— I have learned now how to give orders and to enforce them . Deign only to allow your soldiers to give the signal for a truce , just to hoist the flag on the tower , and not one of their heads shall fall , I swear it ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p>To make that offer to me , Prince , you must not be of the Imperial blood —— The Daughter of Heaven can never accept the mercy of a Tartar !——</p>

    <stage>First Tableau .</stage>
    <stage>[ Before the curtain rises the shouts of the crowd are heard , mingled with sound of gongs and bells . The execution-ground under the ramparts of Peking . A colossal grey wall with battlements , occupies the back of the stage , and , on the left , disappears from view in the distance . Chinese prisoners are attached to stakes all along the wall , others are in the cangue , under a huge red signboard . Here and there decapitated heads hang dripping from spikes . There are bloodstains all over the ground . A noisy crowd hurries along the front of the scene . The men wearing modern Peking costume , long queues , blue cotton robes and goat-skin tunics . The TARTAR women , of lower-class , wear a horn-like coiffure with large artificial flowers in it . In the foreground , to the left , is the large tent of the TARTAR GENERAL ; of greenish leather , with a yellow roofing , surmounted by a silver bell-turret . It is wide open . The interior is carpeted with the skins of wild beasts ; a circular table surrounds the central pole ; carpets , camp-stools , a little table , and a square banner bearing the name of the GENERAL . Guards and Soldiers , with naked sabres . Camels are lying all around , among bales of goods and arms . Carriages , palanquins .</stage>
    <stage>As the curtain rises , the crowd continues to shout wildly . Vendors of hot drinks are walking about with copper urns on their backs ; barbers are ringing their bells ; blind conjurers are playing the flute , sweetmeat-pedlars are striking gongs . The executioners in the immediate foreground are wiping the dripping blades of their swords . ]</stage>

You would have thought someone in great authority was watching over her with wonderful solicitude , warning her of dangers or endeavouring to turn them aside from her .</p>

      <p>Oh , when will this dreadful war cease , which is renewed and has already soaked the soil of our country in the blood of her sons ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FAITHFUL PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>I fear it will never end until one of the two races has been exterminated —— Yet perhaps the hatred would be less intense if the conquerors after their victory would treat the defeated with more clemency . Let there not be so many executions , so much bloodshed . Each soldier who can no longer defend his life should be sacred .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>TARTAR GENERAL</speaker>
      <p>Pardon was offered to your soldiers if they would yield . All refused .</p>

      <p>What can be done ? Our duty is to obey .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FAITHFUL PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>Not to the extent of a crime . A little stone can ofttimes retard the course of a heavy chariot . We , the chieftains , by sacrificing only our own lives could thereby save the crowds .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TARTAR GENERAL</speaker>
      <p>How could that be ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FAITHFUL PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>By opposing unrighteousness . Do you remember ? There was once another war similar in every way to this . The city was sacked , the command was given to the executioners to cut off all heads as now . But a young officer , maddened by grief at the thought of such carnage , found words wherewith to beseech the general to be merciful , or at least to restrict the number of executions , with the result that he consented to limit the massacre to the length of time which is required to burn a stick of incense . The incense was lighted and the first head was about to fall , when the young officer trembling with horror seized the stick , reduced it to powder and ran to the executioner , crying aloud “ It is finished , it is finished . Pardon has been declared . ” Then , since he had disobeyed , he immediately dashed his head against a rock . The people erected a temple in memory of this hero , which is still to be seen on a high hill and whose steps have for many centuries been constantly covered with fresh flowers .</p>

Pillars of red laquer support a lofty ceiling , on which are enormous writhing dragons among red clouds ; the largest standing out so clearly that it looks ready to fall from heaven , holds in its jaws a golden orb , just above the throne . The floor is covered by a yellow carpet , with dragons more than fifty feet in length woven into the design . On one side of the stage is a marble chime , suspended by golden chains from a huge frame work , whose feet are of gold and represent monsters and whose upper angles are ornamented with golden phoenixes spreading their wings toward the ceiling . Near the principal entrance two EUNUCHS are holding dust-dispellers of rhinoceros-hide . Preparations are being made for a solemn audience , to commemorate the triumph of the TARTAR ARMY . Large blocks of porcelain , representing monsters , are arranged in line on the carpet . They mark the places where the various bodies of dignitaries are to stand and to prostrate themselves . Persons in gala robes come and go hurriedly . They are speaking in whispers , and walk noiselessly , in respectful attitudes . They bow as they pass the throne .</stage>

That hour there , in the garden of her palace , in the midst of that crowd where we were so alone , when she gazed upon me , when our souls were united in one supreme rapture —— But now at the thought of seeing her again , I tremble like a guilty man .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Exit the EMPEROR , with his councillor , through a side door . Two eunuchs and two women attendants conduct the EMPRESS to the foot of the throne , and after having prostrated themselves retire , leaving her alone . She is in white robes of mourning , her hands are tied by a silken cord .</stage>

      <p><stage>Soliloquising</stage>Such consideration has been shown me that I am terrified , more terrified than at torture and death . Why am I in his palace , instead of in a prison ?—— What can he , what dares he hope ? What does he desire of me ?</p>

     <stage>FAITHFUL PRINCE</stage>
     <stage>In the dress of the TARTAR GENERAL , running into the room and prostrating himself at the feet of the EMPRESS ] Oh ! Heaven is merciful to grant me the opportunity once again before my death to prostrate myself at the feet of my adored Empress .</stage>

      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p><stage>Calm but bewildered</stage>You ? You here ?—— Dear Prince —— Have we then departed this life ? Is this our reunion beyond the grave ? If not , whence have you come , how , by what witchcraft have you passed these dreadful walls ?</p>

      <speaker>FAITHFUL PRINCE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Still prostrated</stage>Boldness does not count the cost , when there is no longer anything to lose —— And , beyond all doubt , the gods were with me —— Yes , I entered as if by witchcraft as you say , I passed the walls and the guarded gates —— One of his soldiers acted as my guide —— I gave him all the gold I had left . Forgive me , I am weeping , I know not whether for joy or grief . For joy it must be — since my only wish was for this one privilege — to see Your Majesty for the last time , to tell her on my knees of my passionate adoration —— which at the gates of death cannot be an offence —— and above all to offer her the wondrous gift , which will deliver her from the conqueror 's worst outrages . My mission as faithful subject is now concluded by this last service , by the glorious present which I have brought to my Empress .</p>

     <stage>The EMPEROR enters and approaches her . The EMPRESS , her eyes lowered , stands motionless .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <p>Daughter of Heaven , deign to raise your eyes to gaze upon the heart-broken conqueror who bows before you . Deign to look and to recognise him . Doubtless you will remember him . But can you feel anything save utter hatred for him ?</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>EMPRESS</stage>
     <stage>Far away , her eyes still lowered . ] To recognise him , I do not need to hear his voice again nor to gaze upon his face . The light has dawned upon my mind during the hours of my captivity . Before I was brought in here , I knew full well into whose presence I was coming .</stage>
     <stage>A silence , during which the EMPEROR remains bowed before her .</stage>

But now !<stage>He approaches , yet hesitates to touch her hands . The EMPRESS draws back , gazing at him for the first time .</stage>Oh ! pardon —— Before you , in the depth of my grief , I had forgotten . I had almost dared to touch your bruised hands . And yet you are more sacred to me here than there in Nanking , in all your splendour .<stage>He strikes the gong softly . An OFFICIAL appears .</stage></p>

      <p><stage>To the OFFICIAL</stage>Let the Governess of the Palace come here at once !<stage>To the GOVERNESS , as she enters and prostrates herself .</stage>Untie the hands of the Empress , and then go .<stage>The GOVERNESS obeys and goes out . A pause .</stage>Your voice is no longer yours . Your eyes are no longer yours . You stand here before me , yet your soul seems to be at an infinite distance . I did not expect to find you so , and you frighten me . The Majesty of death is upon you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p>They are calling to me from the Land of the Shades . Allow me to cross the threshold soon , from you I can accept no mercy . My faithful ones , my warriors , are wondering at my delay in rejoining them , and my son is listening to catch the echo of my footfall behind him on the dark path .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <p>Your son !—— Ah ! Your son ! Who has mourned him more than I , excepting only you ? Ten of my couriers , my swiftest horsemen , were sent at once , riding their horses night and day , spurring them to death , leaving their corpses by the roadside , in a frantic effort to arrive in time and avert the evil which could not be repaired ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p>What was achieved ? Where is the body of my little son ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <p>It is now in an imperial hearse , making its slow way to the north , preceded by funeral music , followed by a thousand dignitaries in costumes of state befitting the rank of a young sovereign .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p>And where are they taking him , my son ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <p>To those inviolable forests where the Tartar Emperors repose . There , in a vale , which the spade of men has never touched , two leagues of dark cedars will envelope in their silence , his tomb built all of porcelain .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p>Will you grant me the favour to sleep near him ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <p><stage>Very gently , speaking like a child</stage>But —— in accordance with the custom of the Empresses , you will yourself choose the site and scene in the forest and will have the long marble avenues built —— so that all may be in readiness when your hour strikes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p>My hour has sounded — ah ! many days ago . I heard it , but my hands were tied and your guards were ever about me . Now you will give me my last freedom , will you not ? so that I may join all the dead heroes who are awaiting me . To keep me back would be unworthy of you , my noble enemy . You would not do that !——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <p><stage>After a pause</stage>Keep you back , you ?—— O ! no , not I —— But your duty —— Daughter of the Mings , you are incapable of failing in your duty !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p><stage>Excitedly at last</stage>My duty ! What duty ? Already have I been decoyed by that word . They urged me thereby to flee like a common woman beset by fear . While all my brave defenders knew how to die heroically , my soldiers , my princes , even my ladies-in-waiting , I like a coward escaped through the subterranean passages of my palace —— to fulfil my duty ! It was the hour when my soldiers were falling by the thousand , struck down by yours , when my walls were crumbling under the assault of your armies —— the draught of the Great Deliverance had been brought me in a cup , and I was calm as I am now — but smiling . I was about to raise the cup to my lips , to pass beyond the reach of all , proud and inviolable , in my imperial attire . The vaults beneath the ground , the sleeping place of my ancestors , unknown to your Tartars , stood open close at hand , and there was still time to carry me down into them —— But duty ! Ah ! my duty , it appeared , was to flee , and I yielded —— And until the day when your soldiers took me captive , I wandered on and on through the country , at the head of my defeated troops —— I , the Empress , the Invisible , desecrating my majesty among all those thousands of men —— marching before them like some mad woman !——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <p>Say rather that you were the sublime heroine , the great warrior-Empress , the goddess of battle , who braved arrows and bullets , and will live on eternally in poetry and history !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p>I sought to justify my flight , that was all . I did all I could , but none can ever atone for a cowardly action . It was in my own palace that I should have met my death , in the funeral fire lighted by my own hand , in which so many heroes were consumed —— My ashes should have mixed with theirs . Duty , do you say ? But do you believe that I still belong to Earth ? My cities are in ruins , my armies annihilated , my son dead . And at this very moment I know that one by one the heads of my few remaining soldiers are falling into the dust beneath your high Tartar walls . Then what duty remains , I ask you ?<stage>She takes the dagger from the fold of her robe and raises her hand to strike herself .</stage>Nothing , nothing but this !<stage>The Emperor rushes towards her with a cry , seizes her wrist , takes the dagger , and hurls it to the ground .</stage>Ah ! So you dare to touch me now ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <p><stage>Bowing very low</stage>Your pardon ! Only listen to me . You may die afterwards if you wish it , I promise you — but in some less terrible way —— without this bloodshed . I will even furnish you the means , if you still wish it ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p><stage>With sudden gentleness</stage>In some less terrible way ! Yes , that is what I desire . The Potion of the Great Deliverance , we sovereigns are never without it . You have it too , have you not ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <p>Night and day within easy reach , especially since you began to risk your life hourly , in the thick of the battle . I feared that I should be unable to capture alive my beautiful Phoenix of War ! Be assured , we have the Deliverance . It is in this golden case , among the trinkets at my girdle .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p>And you will give it to me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <p>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p>You swear it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <p>Yes . After you have listened to me , I shall have this supreme courage . To refuse you would be unworthy of you and of myself . But , after you have heard me , only afterwards ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p>Well , speak , sire . In return for your promise , take the last minutes in which my ears can hear , my eyes can see ——</p>

      <p>It was not the prompting of a mere whim which urged me to see you seated there . What we have to say is so solemn .

      <p>You are sovereign and doubly sovereign now , mistress of the destiny of China , arbiter of all .<stage>The EMPRESS looks at him as though deeply hurt .</stage>Mistress of the destiny of China , yes ! Be not offended . I do not intend to speak of your power over the Emperor —— But , defeated and captive , what does it matter ? Are you not always the Daughter of the Mings ? Hundreds of millions of hearts bear secret allegiance to you . The rebellion quelled to-day by my soldiers will break out afresh to-morrow , will always be renewed . You are the only being in the world who has the power to still it for ever —— and that takes away the right to die ——</p>

      <p><stage>Interrupting</stage>The dead await me —— I belong to them now —— I hear their voices calling to me to come ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <p>I want to tell you in the fewest words . But I feel as though you were already gone , already cold . I press on and I am all at a loss . It seems as if I were speaking to a tombstone . Powers , you and I , I said , ah , yes , great powers ! Two rival lives of fabled emperors , of deified heroes , growing feebler and feebler by centuries of slavery to rites and forms , prisoners in an excess of luxury ; two dynasties that seemed doomed to an immortality of mummyhood , have by some miracle produced you and me , who are alive and young . As a result of our union , a new China might arise , living like us , to dominate the world . Together we might accomplish that holy mission for the well-being and happiness of our races , and the eternal glory of our two united names . But without you , no , I can do nothing . I shall sink again into my gilded solitude , my sickly idleness , my opium-drugged sleep . If you but knew my youth , how isolated and lonely , spent in an apartment decorated in black ebony ! In the gloom of this palace , an imaginative child , I outlined this glorious plan of union with you . It haunted my brain . Then your son would have been my son . It was like a child still that I set out on that adventure to see you in your palace at Nanking . And as I beheld , my man 's will , which still floated in the midst of dreams , was suddenly concentrated upon one definite desire . Ah , what obstacles I overcame ! First , I had to escape from your palace ; then to return here unhindered within the terrible walls of the Yellow City ; and then to wrest the power from those grim evil-doers who had so long tortured my youthful will and my reason . The war was already at its height , hatred was enchained , the smell of blood was in the air , and Chinese and Tartars were howling like wild beasts . All this , you know full well , I was unable to stop .</p>

      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p>I know .</p>

      <p>Now I believe it .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <p>The heads of your faithful soldiers which have just fallen were sacrificed against my will . I had issued an order of unconditional pardon . As to the Prince who left you a few minutes ago .<stage>Smiling</stage>— for I see all , I the Phantom Emperor , as you called me — yes , he who was speaking to you in this very place and went so heroically to meet his death , will be saved . You shall see him again !</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>

      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <p>Every word you utter falls upon me like the icy drops of slow winter rain , and yet withal I must have the force to proceed to the end . Listen to what I now shall say ; it is the last word I shall speak , after that you will be free . Despite that dreadful war to the death between us , despite that funeral procession which now slowly carries your son to the forests of the Last Repose , I still indulged in the beautiful dream of putting an end to ancient hates by means of our marriage , of making one our two rival dynasties , of giving to the great empire peace everlasting ——</p>

      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <p>Still one word , one last word . We are not alone at this solemn historical hour , in this place which seems so empty and silent . The shades of warriors and the illustrious spirits of departed emperors are all about us , listening anxiously for your decision . Your beloved dead are all here , at peace with mine in the lofty harmony of heaven . You are mistaken , they are not calling to you to join them ; they are commanding you to live for years to come , to aid me in this great work of peace , of which I dream and which , without you seated at my side on this throne , I shall be powerless to carry out . You have not the right to decline this duty ! In the name of the thousands of invisible spirits who surround us , I beg of you , Daughter of Heaven , to live !<stage>A silence .</stage>I have said all that I find possible to say . I await your decision . I have finished .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p><stage>Growing colder and more distant in her attitude , pointing to the golden jewel-case attached to the Emperor 's girdle</stage>Then give it to me now !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <p><stage>In absolute despair</stage>No , no ! Give it to you with my own hands I cannot . Have pity —— I cannot ! I cannot !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p><stage>Severely</stage>But your promise , sire , your imperial word of honour . Give it to me !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>The EMPEROR , after another silence , kneels before her , takes the golden box from his girdle and hands it to her slowly , his face turned downward to the ground .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p><stage>After opening the box , speaking gently , like a child in a dream .</stage>Yes , they are tiny , shining pearls —— And they will bring death , peace , nothingness .<stage>She puts the pearls in her mouth , then throws the box to the ground , and rises in exaltation . Triumphant and dominating the room , she addresses the invisible spirits of her forefathers .</stage>Oh , my ancestors , behold me ! Am I not glorious ? You see me in that place whence you of old dominated the world , and it is upon your throne , usurped by the Tartar , that I am about to die ! Your daughter has remained worthy of her race . Despite temptation more than human , she has kept her word . Open wide before the portals of death ,— to receive her among you .<stage>Smiling and quite gentle , she turns to the EMPEROR who is still kneeling .</stage>And now that my mission is accomplished , approach me , sire .<stage>She takes his hand gently , to indicate that he may rise and be seated .</stage>For the second time in her life , the Empress invites you to be seated in her presence , as once before , over there , you remember , one morning in my palace which is now no more ——<stage>She seats herself on the throne again .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <p><stage>Dreamily</stage>As once before , there in your garden on that never-to-be-forgotten morning . All about us , the wonderful flowers of distant lands were unfolding their petals , still moist with the early dews —— and the beautiful Imperial Phoenix was brilliant in all her glory .<stage>He seats himself on the throne near her , his head resting against the back .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p>To-day , the flames have swept away those flowers , and the Phoenix is in agony , her wings burned in the fire of war . But , on the threshold of the Great Beyond , she will confide to you her deepest secret . Now it is your turn to listen .<stage>The EMPEROR raises his head and looks at her .</stage>While you were uttering those noble and magnificent words of sacrifice —— Oh ! beneath my impassive mask , what a struggle was mine on to be deaf to their appeal ! And I should have yielded , if the duty which you presented to me had been only a painful duty . But it would have been too easy and too sweet . For I loved you !<stage>The EMPEROR arises .</stage>And , living , I have no more the right to happiness , because it was I who lighted that great funeral pyre of men 's lives in my palace .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <p><stage>Interrupting , exultantly</stage>O my sovereign ! O my beautiful , fading flower ! To hear that from your lips at the moment when they are about to grow cold for ever ! Oh ! To be beloved by you , I could not believe it possible . And now no aid can come from men or gods .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p>No aid ? Do you think I would accept it ? I have spoken only because I know I am going to die . Aid ! But did I not tell you it was I who lighted the pyre , this hand which set to it the flaming torch . And as they threw themselves into the glowing furnace , dying for my son and for me , I cried out my solemn vow : Soon I come to the Land of the Shades , I come , I follow you . After that , if I were to live , to spend a happy life with you —— I should loathe myself .<stage>She remains seated , the EMPEROR kneels at her feet , resting his head on the cushions of the throne .</stage>In entering your palace , I was afraid of myself , it was only myself that I feared —— for at no time did I hate that strange impostor who appeared in my palace one day , never did I hate him even when I knew not , when I did not understand . And in the closed litter in which I was brought to Peking , at every stage of that mournful journey my fears and my anguish increased , according as the impression became stronger and stronger , until at last I was convinced that you were the Emperor !<stage>Suddenly terrified , she starts up .</stage>You have not deceived me ? Tell me , it is indeed death which you have given me ? Oh , no , you could not have done that . You are too noble to have led me into a trap ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <p>No , my sovereign , no , I have not deceived you . Death is close to you , it is in your heart , inevitable death .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p>Will it take long ? How many minutes are still left to me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <p>Minutes ? Oh , scarcely seconds . You are on the point of slipping away from me into nothingness . The frail covering of gold leaf still protects you . As soon as that dissolves ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p>I shall suffer ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <p>No !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p>Tell me how I shall pass away .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <p>You will hear a ringing in your brain as if the great bell of honour were being sounded for you — and then a dizziness — and suddenly will come eternal peace !<stage>He rises and rends his garments .</stage>O Gods , if you are capable of compassion , look down upon me —— have pity !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p><stage>At first very slowly , pacing the platform of the throne like one in a dream .</stage>Whither am I going ? Who can tell me whither I am going , where I shall soon be ? To the dead ? to the Shades , what can it matter how I use this last flicker of my life , so soon to be extinguished ? Now that I have kept my word , at least this last moment belongs to me , which to us is worth Eternity .<stage>To the EMPEROR .</stage>Let it be mine that I may give it to you !<stage>She seats herself on the throne again .</stage>Come close to me , my beloved , my master , my God —— -<stage>The EMPEROR sits near her , at first as with religious awe .</stage>Come , I desire to rest my head on your shoulder while I die ——<stage>The EMPEROR takes her in his arms .</stage>Do you not see that we are like two stars , separated by a boundless abyss , but withal making desperate efforts to flash their light to each other ?—— But now the abyss is crossed and my mortal enemy is weeping tears for love in my embrace . Let me rest against your breast , come closer , with all your being , that I may pass away as though in you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <lg>
       <stage>Embracing her more passionately</stage>
       <l>In me and with me , for I shall follow you , my beautiful</l>
       <l>Phoenix , that would fly away beyond my reach ——</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p>No ! Remain on earth , live on to keep the love which I have given you . Who else would remember me and pay the honours to my spirit ? In the valley of eternal silence , amid the marble avenues , under the shade of the dark cedars , who else would come to dream of my vanished beauty , that was but for a day ? Promise me you will stay . But come still closer to me . If you do not fear the last breath of one who is dying , press your lips against mine , my beloved , that I may at least have known the rapture of your kiss ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
      <p><stage>Pressing his lips to hers desperately</stage>Oh ! Even your ashes would be lovely to me , even your body in decay . Fear ! you ask if I fear ? Respect alone will unlock my embrace — when I feel that the breath of life is no more .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMPRESS</speaker>
      <p><stage>Wandering , half drawing herself away</stage>Ah ! Yes — I hear the great bell sounding . It is the signal , then ? I am sinking —— Hold me up , my beloved . Keep me from sinking thus —— into the abyss .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>During an instant of silence , they remain embraced . Then the EMPEROR rouses himself , cries aloud in his grief , and the dead body falls back on the throne .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SCENE X</speaker>
      <p>The EMPEROR , and then the CROWD .<stage>The EMPEROR descends the steps of the throne , quickly , runs to the gong and strikes three deep strokes . The doors are thrown open . Dignitaries and Officials appear on the threshold .</stage>The EMPEROR<stage>addressing the crowd , who enter in robes of state , and pointing to the dead Empress .</stage>Come , all dignitaries and great men of the Empire ! Put perfumes in the censers , keep on amber ! Sound the marble chimes , as for the gods . Pay homage to Your Empress ! On your knees , all , before The Daughter of Heaven !——</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He kneels on the steps himself . The marble chimes are sounded . The brilliant crowd fills the throne-room , prostrating themselves before the dead .</stage>
