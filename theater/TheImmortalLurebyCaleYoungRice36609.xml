      <p>SCENE : A work-room of GIORGIONE on the edge of the Lagoon in which lie the Campo Santo and Murano . It is littered with brushes , canvases , casts , etc ., and its walls are frescoed indiscriminately with saints and bacchantes , satyrs and Madonnas , on backgrounds religious or woodland . A door is on the right back ; and foliate Gothic windows , in the rear , reveal the magic water with its gliding gondolas . On a support toward the centre of the room is a picture — covered , and not far from it , a couch . Late Afternoon . GIORGIONE , who has been sitting anguished on the couch , rises with determined bitterness . As he does so , BELLINI enters anxiously .</p>

       <l>Tho it has been till now my adoration !</l>
       <l>The fairest of my dreams and the most holy !</l>
       <l>Yes , by the virtue of all honest women ,</l>
       <l>If such there be in Venice ,</l>
       <l>I swear it shall be borne by ribald hands</l>

       <l>On what was purer to me than the Virgin !</l>
       <l>The very pimps and panders of the Piazza</l>

      <speaker>Bellini</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>Nor have ,</l>
       <l>Ever , to heed me ! as Aretino ,</l>
       <l>Who turns your praise to Titian , has told .</l>
       <l>For your wild will runs ever without curb ,</l>
       <l>And I who reared you , as my very own ,</l>
       <l>Must pay the fall .</l>

      <speaker>Bellini</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>And the piety</l>
       <l>I would have won you to in the past days</l>
       <l>Is wasted . The Madonnas</l>
       <l>I painted with a heart inspired of Heaven</l>
       <l>You paint with pride .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Giorgione</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>But with all gratitude !</l>
       <l>Ah yes , believe me ,</l>
       <l>And with a rich remembrance !</l>
       <l>For scarce oblivion could wipe from me</l>
       <l>How as a wasted lad I came to Venice —</l>
       <l>A miserable , patched and pallid waif ,</l>
       <l>With but an eye to see and hand to shape !</l>
       <l>You took me from the streets and taught me all</l>
       <l>The old can teach the young , until my name</l>
       <l>Is high in Venice —</l>
       <l>Linked with that of Beauty —</l>
       <l>“ Giorgione ! our Giorgione ! ” do they cry</l>
       <l>On the canals , the very gondoliers .</l>
       <l>And in a little while it should have glowed</l>
       <l>Immortal on the breast of Italy ,</l>
       <l>As does Apelles on the page of Greece ,</l>
       <l>For I was half-divine , until ——</l>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Bellini</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>Until</l>
       <l>A girl whom you had fixed your heart upon</l>
       <l>With boundless folly , you who should have lived</l>
       <l>With but one passion — that of brain and brush —</l>
       <l>Until she ——</l>

      <speaker>Giorgione</speaker>
      <p>Say it !</p>

      <p>This Isotta ——</p>

      <speaker>Giorgione</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>Ai !</l>
       <l>Whom I had chosen o'er a hundred others</l>
       <l>To soar with !</l>
       <l>To soar and then in wedded peace to prize !</l>
       <l>This false Isotta</l>
       <l>Whom in poverty</l>
       <l>I found , as you found me , and loved to madness .</l>
       <l>This fair Isotta</l>
       <l>Whom I would have made</l>
       <l>All Venice to be a halo for — as were</l>
       <l>Cities of old for queens of sceptred love :</l>
       <l>Until she leaves , departs , forsakes me , goes</l>
       <l>Away , worthless away , from my true arms ,</l>
       <l>With Luzzi , a lank boy .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bellini</speaker>
      <p>So . And most strange .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Giorgione</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>No , nothing a woman does is ever strange !</l>
       <l>Will they not cloak a lie in innocence ,</l>
       <l>A treachery in veiling soft caresses —</l>
       <l>Tho to the Mass unceasingly they fare</l>
       <l>And say like her their aves night and noon ?</l>
       <l>Have they a want that wantons not with guile ,</l>
       <l>A tear that is not turgid with deceit ?</l>
       <l>Are not their passions blown by every wind ?</l>
       <l>Have they not all the straying heart of Helen ?</l>
       <l>Then why must I ,</l>
       <l>Who had in me a hope</l>
       <l>That rivalled Raphael 's or Leonardo 's ,</l>
       <l>Keep , cozened so , that I contemn her shame ?</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bellini</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>Because she is a woman — whom you tempted ,</l>
       <l>Tho with all trust to wed her — and you know not</l>
       <l>Whether her going was of shamelessness .</l>
       <l>Giorgione</l>
       <stage>laughing bitterly</stage>
       <l>Or whether she may not yet return , today ,</l>
       <l>And with a heart that is a nymph 's , a soul</l>
       <l>That is a nun 's ,</l>
       <l>Beguile me back to doting ?</l>
       <l>Whether she may not —</l>
       <l>With that body God</l>
       <l>Might once , deceived , have moulded angels after —?</l>
       <l>Then flaunt her thralling of me to the world ,</l>
       <l>Whose ready lips should laugh where'er we went</l>
       <l>And whisper , “ Isotta , there ! Giorgione 's mistress !</l>
       <l>Who makes a mocking of him ? ”</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bellini</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>Never ! never !</l>
       <l>Only your unrelenting brain would think it .</l>
       <l>For this I know of her , that tho she has</l>
       <l>Deserted you for what must seem to be</l>
       <l>Only a new-found passion —</l>
       <l>Yet is she womanly , and did you give her ,</l>
       <l>As now you mean , to avid lusting eyes ,</l>
       <l>Life would be smitten from her .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>

      <speaker>Giorgione</speaker>

      <lg>
       <l>And then from you , repentant of her fate ?</l>
       <l>No , no , my son , I have not seen you rise ,</l>
       <l>A planet from the sea , the world 's first painter ,</l>
       <l>To set in this :</l>
       <l>You owe my fathering more .</l>
       <l>And listen , I have brought to you a way</l>
       <l>Of laurels for forgetting . I have come</l>
       <l>With a commission from the Signoria ,</l>
<stage>Takes it from his breast .</stage>       <l>Which names you the chief glory of this city</l>
       <l>And votes you proud permission to adorn</l>
       <l>San Marco 's highest altar with perfection .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Giorgione</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>And which I spurn , an insult in its pity !</l>
<stage>Flings it from him .</stage>       <l>As they shall learn — these silk and velvet Signors ,</l>
       <l>Whose condescending ducats buy the dreams</l>
       <l>Of the immortal !</l>
       <l>Or no !... I meant not that — to wound a kindness .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bellini</speaker>
      <p>Your ways have ever been the ways of wounding .</p>

      <speaker>Giorgione</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>And to the end must be .</l>
       <stage>Brokenly</stage>
       <l>For now my hand</l>
       <l>Is palsied ! I can never paint again .</l>
       <l>Colour and shaping light turn in my soul</l>
       <l>To chaos and to blindness — to despair !</l>
       <l>The brush I lift , to sterile pain more loth !</l>
       <l>I yearn and impotence alone arises .</l>
       <l>That picture has dried beauty 's vein within me</l>
       <l>And left me ... Ah !... She shall atone it !</l>
       <stage>calls</stage>
       <l>Gigia !</l>
       <l>Shameless she is and shall be seen it !— Gigia !—</l>
<stage>Bitterly .</stage>       <l>Aretino , who is the tongue of lewdness ,</l>
       <l>And Titian , who trips to it , may gloat ,</l>
<stage>GIGIA hobbles in .</stage>       <l>But they ——</l>

      <p>How can I tell you , if I may Not speak ? And you should hear ...<stage>Crossing herself</stage>It is the plague .

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bellini</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>Then , O my son , it is a premonition ,</l>
       <l>A pall against this purpose ! that you may</l>
       <l>Not let these ribald two —</l>
       <l>Aretino , this poet and depraver ,</l>
       <l>And Titian snared within his pagan senses ,</l>
       <l>Enter and gaze upon .... O boy , you will not !</l>
       <l>Despoil the picture ,</l>
       <l>Scatter it to the seas ,</l>
       <l>And vow never again to paint another ,</l>
       <l>Tho that would break my heart , but promise me ——</l>
      </lg>

     <stage>A knocking interrupts , and a voice without calls lustily :</stage>
     <stage>Voice : The gods of paint and passion ever gird us ! Where 's Messer Giorgione ? Ho ! Ho , ho ! [ GIGIA hurries out . Giorgione ( after a pause , calling ) . Aretino !</stage>

       <l>But where is she —?</l>
       <l>A-ho !</l>
       <l>Old Gigia , is it ? Then we come apace ,</l>
<stage>Enters leeringly with TITIAN .</stage>       <l>Like satyrs to the piping of Adonis !</l>
<stage>With irony .</stage>       <l>A health to you , O heaven-born of Venice !</l>
<stage>To BELLINI .</stage>       <l>And to you , glorious dauber of Madonnas !</l>

       <l>What is it ? The tale is out about the maid ?</l>
       <l>And therefore tears ?</l>
<stage>Laughs .</stage>       <l>Well , by the lids of Venus , Giorgio ,</l>
       <l>It serves you well — or Eve was not a woman !</l>
       <l>There were too many ripe for your assay .</l>
       <l>Why , I believe that every damsel 's lips</l>
       <l>On the lagoons were pinched with longing for you !</l>

       <l>Since she , the amorous sun-kissed Isotta ,</l>
       <l>Had charms too fair for one to satisfy !</l>
       <l>And yet — to choose this Luzzi ,</l>
       <l>This swaddling acolyte of Innocence ,</l>
       <l>For her new light-o ’ - love ! to choose him out ,</l>

Toward the right front is a furnace with alembics , retorts , etc . ; right and left are doors , and on the left and back another alcove before which hang curtains . Lamps burn .

     <stage>He leads her behind the curtains then goes , door left . A moment , which leaves RHASIS distraught , and ARDUIN enters . He pauses , as if at some presence ; then , gazing on the sarcophagus , shudders with hope and comes down .</stage>

       <l>As the moon is in heaven ! as the skies !</l>
<stage>In an ecstasy .</stage>       <l>For last night I beheld</l>
       <l>In dreams deeper than day how it must be .</l>
       <l>I saw a tomb far-hidden in the earth</l>
       <l>And Life within it</l>
       <l>Mixing salt and sulphur —</l>
       <l>Twin elements</l>
       <l>Of the great trinity .</l>
       <l>I saw her hands pour out quick mercury</l>
       <l>Upon a bat 's wing wrought with hieroglyphics ,</l>
       <l>And then I saw her cast in gold and silver</l>
       <l>That melted with strange voice and sudden flame ,</l>
       <l>The while she gazed on me most meaningly .</l>
       <l>And then ... when all was done ....</l>
<stage>The vision consuming him .</stage>       <l>My wife , my Rhea , lit with loveliness</l>
       <l>And as a spirit clad with resurrection ,</l>
       <l>Rose up within my dream ... fair , young and glad !...</l>

       <l>Pardon ! I know not — only that you say</l>
       <l>Some come of Ophiuchus —</l>
       <l>The demon you have warned me of — who oft</l>
       <l>With thwarting laugh has struck the secret from you ....</l>
       <l>Many before have followed the mirage</l>
       <l>Of dreams — but to more thirst : trust not too much !</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Arduin</speaker>
      <p>But fear ? fear ? you are falling from me too ? Like Ion the son of him who ... you ? you too ? At the prime moment ?</p>

       <l>Believe — do , do ?— that she cannot arise ?</l>
       <l>Did not great Hermes say of the Elixir</l>
       <l>It should be found —</l>
       <l>And did not Polydos ,</l>
       <l>The Greek , chancing upon it , raise his friends</l>
       <l>In battle slain ?...</l>
       <l>Did not the Jew of Galilee , the Christ ,</l>
       <l>Whom even you name Prophet , likewise win it ?</l>

       <l>Did I not hear a voice</l>
       <l>That breathed into my brain she should arise ?</l>
       <l>And as I waited did a book of wisdom</l>
       <l>Not chance into my hands to show the way ?</l>
       <l>Were the first words I read not , In ten years</l>
       <l>The miracle shall come —</l>

<stage>Begins to gird himself .</stage>       <l>Must !... and the hour is now !—</l>

      <p>I will do all you say . But , master , if —— Arduin<stage>immitigably</stage>No death-word more of doubt . It is the power Which holds us futile from omnipotence . Mete out the sulphur Into the alembic Of Cleopatra 's crystal .— I must see her !<stage>Rhasis hastens .</stage>See her again , my Rhea , as she was , When plucking first the poppies of Provence ! And hear flow from her Words sweeter than Memnon 's in the wind of dawn ! Here 's gold and silver<stage>hands them</stage>She shall rise and say : “ Years pale you , pale your brow , my Arduin , And touch to gray the treasure of your hair , But not Antinous could be so fair To me — or wonderful : For you have brought me from the cold tomb to life !... ” The bat 's wing then ! And to the sarcophagus To lift its lid ! for I will wait no longer ——<stage>Takes alembic , as Rhasis obeys , and continues invokingly :</stage>But now , vial of immortality ! By the presaging of the seven planets , And by the searchless sources of the Nile , And by the prayers of Christian and of Heathen , And by the elements earth , air and fire , That hold within their intermingled veins The secret of illimitable life — By fate and time and God — I here conjure you Bring forth the Elixir which shall make her rise !<stage>He pours the ingredients , and quickly fumes arise . They clear and a liquid is seen in the bottom of the glass . With a cry he starts toward the sarcophagus , when Myrrha 's face — which , excited , has parted the curtains — stops him enspelled . Rhasis , unnerved , quits the room — leaving them agaze .</stage>Arduin<stage>at length , as if to a spirit</stage>I do not dream ?... you have arisen ?... Rhea !<stage>Starting toward her .</stage>Arisen ere I touched you ?— O fear not ! For I am Arduin ! do you not know me ?<stage>She trembles speechless .</stage>O wonderful awaking ! O ... at last ! Tho yet the memory of the tomb is on you !... This land is Egypt , whither in my grief I brought you , my dead bride ! Look on me ! see !<stage>Stops quickly .</stage>But no , not yet ! until my youth comes back , As now it will , Over the sea from France ! Already passion lifts away the years That weight its wings and I am as I was . Now gaze upon me , now ! Is it not I ?</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>SCENE : A room in the house of O-Ume in a province near the sea</speaker>
      <p>Its shoji , or sliding paper doors , open in the rear upon a wistaria arbor over-hanging a river , upon which lighted lanterns , sent forth on the night of the Feast of the Dead , are dimly floating ; while the moon above gleams upon the pale distant snow-cone of Fujiyama . The room with its deep straw mats and walls delicately portrayed with pine and bamboo has a paper-paned door on the right leading to a garden , and is lighted by andon — one beneath a shrine to Buddha on the left wall , and one to the left centre where O-UME and AMA are sitting on their heels , constrained , foreboding and verging toward inevitable words . Ama<stage>at length</stage>Down to the sea ! the sea ! Oh the dead ! Do they not seem On the night air to hover ? There by the lights Are not their spirits present ? The lights lit for them ?<stage>O-UME is silent .</stage>All our ancestors are they ! Fathers and mothers Of many lives back ! They hear us speaking , They hear from the Buddha-shrine There on the wall . They see us thinking .<stage>Meaningly .</stage>They see in our hearts ! O-Ume<stage>who trembles</stage>Be silent ! silent ! Ama<stage>bowing but continuing</stage>They know if we care for them — Know as the wind That visits all shoji , Know as the night That searches all places . Alas for the son Who does not honor them ! And for the daughter Who does not cherish them ! They shall —— O-Ume . Be silent !</p>

      <p>SCENE : Before the hermitage of VISHWAMYA and RISHYAS , in a forest near the Ganges . It is an open space spread with kusa-grass and over-hung with trees — the hermitage itself being a cell constructed of earth and of hanging roots of the banyan , and having by it an altar before which lies a deer-skin . Glimmering lights and running water penetrate the shades , whose sacredness is soon disturbed by the appearance of SUNANDI , wantonly compelling KOIL , with alternate harshness and wheedling , to enter with her .</p>

     <stage type="setting">
      <stage>Sunandi ( peering about ) . The place , my jewel-bird ! the place for it ! Under these boughs of peepul and asoka The young saint dwells With his restraining sire , Singing the Vedas morning , eve and noon , And they are gone somewhither now in the wood To gather fruit for sacrifice , and flowers .</stage>
     </stage>
     <stage>With a leer . But he , the boy , will soon return , my pretty . Koil ( whom she has released ) . And you have drawn me from the city here To break into his holy breast with passion ? To dance and sing and seize him ? I you have taught the wiles of winning men , As the cobra-charmer teaches , Must lure him from his saintly innocence , And with the beauty I was born unto Must tangle him ?... You , O Sunandi , are an evil woman , To lead me to it !</stage>

       <l>Who know not that the gods sow food or famine .</l>
<stage>Harshly .</stage>       <l>I tell you that great Indra of the skies</l>
       <l>Is wroth with us</l>
       <l>And will not send us rain ,</l>
       <l>So wisest Brahmins vow —</l>
       <l>Until this boy ,</l>
       <l>This saintly one , is brought unto the Raja !</l>
       <l>Are we to die because not otherwise</l>
       <l>Than with alluring now we can appease them ?</l>
<stage>Leering again .</stage>       <l>And why are women fair , my cunning Koil ,</l>

<stage>Wheedling again .</stage>       <l>But it will be sweet doing , beamy Koil ,</l>
       <l>For the young saint</l>
       <l>Is fairer than the god-born ,</l>
       <l>His body like warm gold and lotos-lithe —</l>
       <l>Made for the wants that tremble in your heart .</l>

       <l>O let us trust it not ! So young a saint</l>
       <l>Should be the holy mate of solitude .</l>
       <l>I would not have him gaze upon me so ,</l>

       <l>For saint so bright an one must be !— it will</l>
       <l>Be dear to touch and tend you !</l>

       <l>Who is old and mighty</l>
       <l>In meditations he would have me mind .</l>

   <note>MANY GODS By CALE YOUNG RICE “ These poems are flashingly , glowingly full of the East .... What I am sure of in Mr. Rice is that here we have an American poet whom we may claim as ours . ” The North American Review ( William Dean Howells ) . “ Mr. Rice has the gift of leadership , and he is a force with whom we must reckon . ” The Boston Transcript . ... “ We find here a poet who strives to reach the goal which marks the best that can be done in poetry . ” The Book News Monthly ( A. S. Henry ) . “ When you hear the pessimists bewailing the good old time when real poets were abroad in the land ... do not fail to quote them almost anything by Cale Young Rice , a real poet writing to-day .... He has done so much splendid work one can scarcely praise him too highly . ” The San Francisco Call . “ In ‘ Many Gods ’ the scenes are those of the East , and while it is not the East of Loti , Arnold or Hearn , it is still a place of brooding , majesty , mystery and subtle fascination . There is a temptation to quote such verses for their melody , dignity of form , beauty of imagery and height of inspiration . ” The Chicago Journal . “ ‘ Love 's Cynic ’ ( a long poem in the volume ) might be by Browning at his best . ” Pittsburg Gazette-Times . “ This is a serious , and from any standpoint , a successful piece of work ... in it are poems that will become classic . ” Passaic ( New Jersey ) News . “ Mr. Rice must be hailed as one among living masters of his art , one to whom we may look for yet greater things . ” Presbyterian Advance . “ This book is in many respects a remarkable work . The poems are indeed poems . ” The Nashville Banner . “ Mr. Rice 's poetical plays reach a high level of achievement .... But these poems show a higher vision and surer mastery of expression than ever before . ” The London Bookman . Net , $ 1. 25 ( postage 12c . ) A NIGHT IN AVIGNON By CALE YOUNG RICE</note>
   <performance>Successfully produced by Donald Robertson “ It is as vivid as a page from Browning . Mr. Rice has the dramatic pulse . ” James Huneker . “ It embraces in small compass all the essentials of the drama . ” New York Saturday Times Review ( Jessie B. Rittenhouse ) . “ It presents one of the most striking situations in dramatic literature and its climax could not be improved . ” The San Francisco Call . “ It has undeniable power , and is a very decided poetic achievement . ” The Boston Transcript . “ It leaves an enduring impression of a soul tragedy . ” The Churchman . “ Since the publication of his ‘ Charles di Tocca ’ and other dramas , Cale Young Rice has justly been regarded as a leading American master of that difficult form , and many critics have ranked him above Stephen Phillips , at least on the dramatic side of his art . And this judgment is further confirmed by ‘ A Night in Avignon . ’ It is almost incredible that in less than 500 lines Mr. Rice should have been able to create so perfect a play with so powerful a dramatic effect . ” The Chicago Record-Herald ( Edwin S. Shuman ) . “ There is poetic richness in this brilliant composition ; a beauty of sentiment and grace in every line . It is impressive , metrically pleasing and dramatically powerful . ” The Philadelphia Record . “ It offers one of the most striking situations in dramatic literature . ” The Louisville Courier-Journal . “ The publication of a poetic drama of the quality of Mr. Rice 's is an important event in the present tendency of American literature . He is a leader in this most significant movement , and ‘ A Night in Avignon ’ is marked , like his other plays , by dramatic directness , high poetic fervor , clarity of poetic diction , and felicity of phrasing . ” The Chicago Journal . “ It is a dramatically told episode , and the metre is most effectively handled , making a welcome change for blank verse , and greatly enhancing the interest . ” Sydney Lee . “ Many critics , on hearing Mr. Bryce 's prediction that America will one day have a poet , would be tempted to remind him of Mr. Rice . ” The Hartford ( Conn .) Courant . Net 50c . ( postage 5c . ) YOLANDA OF CYPRUS A Poetic Drama by CALE YOUNG RICE Minnie Maddern Fisk says : “ No one can doubt that it is superior poetically and dramatically to Stephen Phillips ’ work , ” and that Mr. Rice ranks with Mr. Phillips at his best has often been reaffirmed . “ It is encouraging to the hope of a native drama to know that an American has written a play which is at the same time of decided poetic merit and of decided dramatic power . ” The New York Times ( Charles M. Hathaway , Jr .) . “ The most remarkable quality of the play is its sustained dramatic strength . Poetically it is frequently of great beauty . It is also lofty in conception , lucid and felicitous in style , and the dramatic pulse throbs in every line . ” The Chicago Record-Herald . The Springfield Republican says : “ The characters are drawn with force and the play is dignified and powerful , ” and adds that if it does not succeed on the stage it will be “ because of its excellence . ” “ Mr. Rice is one of the few present-day poets who have the steadiness and weight for a well-sustained drama . ” The Louisville Post ( Margaret Anderson ) . “ It has equal command of imagination , dramatic utterance , picturesque effectiveness and metrical harmony . ” The London ( England ) Bookman . T. P .' s Weekly says : “ It might well stand the difficult test of production and will be welcomed by all who care for serious verse . ” The Glasgow ( Scotland ) Herald says : “ Yolanda of Cyprus is finely constructed ; the irregular blank verse admirably adapted for the exigencies of intense emotion ; the characters firmly drawn ; and the climax serves the purpose of good stagecraft and poetic justice . ” “ It is well constructed and instinct with dramatic power . ” Sydney Lee . “ It is as readable as a novel . ” The Pittsburg Post . “ Here and there an almost Shakespearean note is struck . In makeup , arrangement , and poetic intensity it ranks with Stephen Phillips ’ work . ” The Book News Monthly . Net , $ 1. 25 ( postage 10c . ) CHARLES DI TOCCA By CALE YOUNG RICE “ I take off my hat to Mr. Rice . His play is full of poetry , and the pitch and dignity of the whole are remarkable . ” James Lane Allen . “ It is a dramatic poem one reads with a heightened sense of its fine quality throughout . It is sincere , strong , finished and noble , and sustains its distinction of manner to the end .... The character of Helena is not unworthy of any of the great masters of dramatic utterance . ” The Chicago Tribune . “ The drama is one of the best of the kind ever written by an American author . Its whole tone is masterful , and it must be classed as one of the really literary works of the season . ” ( 1903 ) . The Milwaukee Sentinel . “ It shows a remarkable sense of dramatic construction as well as poetic power and strong characterization . ” James MacArthur , in Harper 's Weekly . “ This play has many elements of perfection . Its plot is developed with ease and with a large dramatic force ; its characters are drawn with sympathy and decision ; and its thoughts rise to a very real beauty . By reason of it the writer has gained an assured place among playwrights who seek to give literary as well as dramatic worth to their plays . ” The Richmond ( Va .) News-Leader . “ The action of the play is admirably compact and coherent , and it contains tragic situations which will afford pleasure not only to the student , but to the technical reader . ” The Nation . “ It is the most powerful , vital , and truly tragical drama written by an American for some years . There is genuine pathos , mighty yet never repellent passion , great sincerity and penetration , and great elevation and beauty of language . ” The Chicago Post . “ Mr. Rice ranks among America 's choicest poets on account of his power to turn music into words , his virility , and of the fact that he has something of his own to say . ” The Boston Globe . “ The whole play breathes forth the indefinable spirit of the Italian renaissance . In poetic style and dramatic treatment it is a work of art . ” The Baltimore Sun . Paper boards . Net , $ 1. 25 ( postage , 9c . ) NIRVANA DAYS Poems by CALE YOUNG RICE “ Mr. Rice has the technical cunning that makes up almost the entire equipment of many poets nowadays , but human nature is more to him always ... and he has the feeling and imaginative sympathy without which all poetry is but an empty and vain thing . ” The London Bookman . “ Mr. Rice 's note is a clarion call , and of his two poems , ‘ The Strong Man to His Sires ’ and ‘ The Young to the Old , ’ the former will send a thrill to the heart of every man who has the instinct of race in his blood , while the latter should be printed above the desk of every minor poet and pessimist .... The sonnets of the sequence , ‘ Quest and Requital , ’ have the elements of great poetry in them . ” The Glasgow ( Scotland ) Herald . “ Mr. Rice 's poems are singularly free from affectation , and he seems to have written because of the sincere need of expressing something that had to take art form . ” The Sun ( New York ) . “ The ability to write verse that scans is quite common .... But the inspired thought behind the lines is a different thing ; and it is this thought untrammeled — the clear vision searching into the deeps of human emotion — which gives the verse of Mr. Rice weight and potency .... In the range of his metrical skill he easily stands with the best of living craftsmen ... and we have in him ... a poet whose dramas and lyrics will endure . ” The Book News Monthly ( A. S. Henry ) . “ These poems are marked by a breadth of outlook , individuality and beauty of thought . The author reveals deep , sincere feeling on topics which do not readily lend themselves to artistic expression and which he makes eminently worth while . ” The Buffalo ( N . Y . ) Courier . “ We get throughout the idea of a vast universe and of the soul merging itself in the infinite .... The great poem of the volume , however , is ‘ The Strong Man to His Sires . ’ ” The Louisville Post ( Margaret S. Anderson ) . “ The poems possess much music ... and even in the height of intensified feeling the clearness of Mr. Rice 's ideas is not dimmed by the obscure haze that too often goes with the divine fire . ” The Boston Globe . Paper boards . Net , $ 1. 25 ( postage 12c . ) DAVID A Poetic Drama by CALE YOUNG RICE “ I was greatly impressed with it and derived a sense of personal encouragement from the evidence of so fine and lofty a product for the stage . ” Richard Mansfield . “ It is a powerful piece of dramatic portraiture in which Cale Young Rice has again demonstrated his insight and power . What he did before in ‘ Charles di Tocca ’ he has repeated and improved upon .... Not a few instances of his strength might be cited as of almost Shakespearean force . Indeed the strictly literary merit of the tragedy is altogether extraordinary . It is a contribution to the drama full of charm and power . ” The Chicago Tribune . “ From the standpoint of poetry , dignity of conception , spiritual elevation and finish and beauty of line , Mr. Rice 's ‘ David ’ is , perhaps , superior to his ‘ Yolanda of Cyprus , ’ but the two can scarcely be compared . ” The New York Times ( Jessie B. Rittenhouse ) . “ Never before has the theme received treatment in a manner so worthy of it . ” The St. Louis Globe-Democrat . “ It needs but a word , for it has been passed upon and approved by critics all over the country . ” Book News Monthly . And again : “ But few recent writers seem to have found the secret of dramatic blank verse ; and of that small number , Mr. Rice is , if not first , at least without superior . ” “ With instinctive dramatic and poetic power , Mr. Rice combines a knowledge of the exigencies of the stage . ” Harper 's Weekly . “ It is safe to say that were Mr. Rice an Englishman or a Frenchman , his reputation as his country 's most distinguished poetic dramatist would have been assured by a more universal sign of recognition . ” The Baltimore News ( writing of all Mr. Rice 's plays ) . Net , $ 1. 25 ( postage 12c . ) SONG-SURF ( Being the Lyrics of Plays and Lyrics ) by CALE YOUNG RICE “ Mr. Rice 's work betrays wide sympathies with nature and life , and a welcome originality of sentiment and metrical harmony . ” Sydney Lee . “ In his lyrics Mr. Rice 's imagination works most successfully . He is an optimist — and in these days an optimist is irresistible — and he can touch delicately things too holy for a rough or violent pathos . ” The London Star ( James Douglas ) . “ Mr. Rice 's highest gift is essentially lyrical . His lyrics have a charm and grace of melody distinctively their own . ” The London Bookman . “ Mr. Rice is keenly responsive to the loveliness of the outside world , and he reveals this beauty in words that sing themselves . ” The Boston Transcript . “ Mr. Rice 's work is everywhere marked by true imaginative power and elevation of feeling . ” The Scotsman . “ Mr. Rice 's work would seem to rank with the best of our American poets of to-day . ” The Atlanta Constitution . “ Mr. Rice 's poems are touched with the magic of the muse . They have inspiration , grace and true lyric quality . ” The Book News Monthly . “ Mr. Rice 's poetry as a whole is both strongly and delicately spiritual . Many of these lyrics have the true romantic mystery and charm .... To write thus is no indifferent matter . It indicates not only long work but long brooding on the beauty and mystery of life . ” The Louisville Post . “ Mr. Rice is indisputably one of the greatest poets who have lived in America .... And some of these ( earlier ) poems are truly beautiful . ” The Times-Union ( Albany , N . Y . ) Net , $ 1. 25 ( postage 12c . )</performance>
