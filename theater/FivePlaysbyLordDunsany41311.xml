    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">Observation and imagination are the basic principles of all poetry . It is impossible to conceive a poetical work from which one of them is wholly absent . Observation without imagination makes for obviousness ; imagination without observation turns into nonsense . What marks the world 's greatest poetry is perhaps the presence in almost equal proportion of both these principles . But as a rule we find one of them predominating , and from this one-sided emphasis the poetry of the period derives its character as realistic or idealistic .</p>
    <p n="2">The poetry of the middle nineteenth century made a fetish of observation . It came as near excluding imagination as it could without ceasing entirely to be poetry . That such exaggeration should sooner or later result in a sharp reaction was natural . The change began during the eighties and gathered full headway in the early nineties . Imagination , so long scorned , came into its rights once more , and it is rapidly becoming the dominant note in the literary production of our own day .</p>
    <p n="3">The new movement has been called “ neo-romantic ” and “ symbolistic . ” Both these names apply , but neither of them exhausts the contents or meaning of the movement which received its first impetus from Ibsen and which later found its typical embodiment in Maeterlinck . From this movement came much of the inspiration that produced the poetical re-birth of Ireland out of which has sprung the man whom I have now the pleasure of introducing to American readers : a man with imagination as elfish as moonlight mist .</p>
    <p n="4">Edward John Moreton Drax Plunkett , Lord Dunsany , is the eighteenth member of his family to bear the title which gives him a place in the Irish peerage . He was born in 1878 and received his education at Eton and Sandhurst . In 1899 he succeeded his father to the title and the family estate in Meath , Ireland . During the South African war he served at the front with the Coldstream Guards . He is passionately fond of outdoor life and often spends the whole day in the saddle before sitting down at his desk to write late at night .</p>
    <p n="5">His work proves , however , that he is as fond of spiritual as of physical exercise , and that he is an inveterate traveller in those mysterious regions of the partly known or wholly unknown where the imagination alone can guide us . His first literary heroes were the brothers Grimm and Andersen . Then the Greek world of Olympians was revealed to him , making a lasting impression on his mind . But it was the Bible that gave him the limpid style which makes his most fantastic tales as real as government reports — or rather much more so . “ For years no style seemed to me natural but that of the Bible , ” he said not long ago , “ and I feared that I would never become a writer when I saw that other people did not use it . ”</p>
    <p n="6">For something like ten years he has been a pretty frequent and increasingly valued contributor to English and Anglo-Irish periodicals . He has previously published five volumes : “ The Gods of Pegana , ” 1905 ; “ Time and the Gods , ” 1906 ; “ The Sword of Welleran , ” 1908 ; “ A Dreamer 's Tales , ” 1910 ; and “ The Book of Wonder , ” 1912 . All are collections of prose pieces that defy accepted classifications . They are fairy tales and short stories and essays and prose poems at the same time .</p>
    <p n="7">The reader has only to take a brief glance at one of those works to make the astounding discovery that he is being introduced to worlds of which he has never heard before . Even the “ Arabian Nights ” have a clearly identifiable background of popular legend and myth . Nothing of the kind is to be found in the writings of Lord Dunsany . He may be said to have created a new mythology wholly his own . He is not only the master but the maker of the countries to which he takes us on such fascinating jaunts . His commonest name for them is the Edge of the World , but sometimes he speaks of them as the Lands of Wonder . This latter name is doubly significant , for the whole movement of which he forms such a striking manifestation has been defined as a “ renascence of wonder . ”</p>
    <p n="8">The names of places and persons appearing in the stories of Lord Dunsany are worth a study in themselves . There are hundreds of them , giving evidence of an inexhaustible imagination ; and each one of them is as aptly suggestive as if generations of men had been at work shaping them . To hear of Sardathion , the city built by the Gods of Old , is to see its domes of marble rising sky-high in the sunset-lighted air . To hear of Slith and Sippy and Slorg , the three thieves who went to the Edge of the World in quest of the Golden Box , is to feel as if one were dealing with historical characters like Aaron Burr or Chinese Gordon . And as we learn more about them , these fanciful creatures of Lord Dunsany 's brain assume still more familiar characteristics , as if they had been studied in some Irish village or English street . It is this fact that reveals one of the main secrets of Lord Dunsany 's appeal : that behind all his exuberant imagination lies a solid basis of observation , enabling him to endow the most impossible adventures with a homely and convincing air .</p>
    <p n="9">The five plays contained in the present volume have all been produced on the stage . “ The Golden Doom ” and “ The Gods of the Mountain ” have been staged most successfully at the Haymarket Theatre , London . “ King Argimenes ” and “ The Glittering Gate ” have been given by the Irish Players , and “ The Lost Silk Hat ” has been put on by Iden Payne at Manchester . In America , the first three have been in the repertoire of Stuart Walker 's Portmanteau Theatre , and “ The Glittering Gate ” has been given by the Neighborhood Players .</p>
    <p n="10">After seeing “ The Gods of the Mountain , ” Frank Harris wrote : “ It was one of the nights of my life ; the only play , I said to myself , which meant anything to me in twenty years or more . ” Without sharing the opinion of Mr. Harris about the dramatic output of the last twenty years , I share fully his enthusiasm in regard to the play that caused his remark . The note struck in it is so distinctly new as to make one gasp as under a sharp shock . But the surprise turns quickly into pleasure such as only the originality of genius can confer .</p>
    <p n="11">It is hard to define just what makes these plays what they are . But certain qualities are tangible . Their deep and rich symbolism is one . It is the kind of symbolism for which the advances of modern psychology had prepared us — the kind that is inseparable from life itself as we are only just beginning to understand it . Another quality is their capacity for suggesting at once the intimate unity and appalling vastness of life . In “ The Golden Doom ” the fate of an empire and a little boy 's desire for a new plaything become linked as facts of equal importance in the web of fate . In “ The Gods of the Mountain ” we meet with an atmosphere of fatality comparable only to that found in the Greek dramas . The crime of hybris , which to the Greeks was the “ unforgivable sin , ” is here made as real to us as it was to them .</p>
   </div>
   <set>
    <p>But these remarks of mine about the inner significance of the plays should not tempt anybody into thinking them deficient in that element of formal perfection without which they could not be classed as works of art . They are , indeed , “ things of beauty , ” and their beauty inheres in their design as well as in their style . Through all of them the greatest possible economy of means has been observed , so that not a word , not a tone , not a gesture is wasted in obtaining the effect aimed at . The dialogue of Maeterlinck is suggested , but not more than suggested . The words spoken by the characters of Maeterlinck are often so vague as to be practically meaningless . The characters of Lord Dunsany speak as simply as those of Maeterlinck , but always sharply to the point ; there can be no mistaking of what they mean , and that meaning serves always to carry the action of the play forward . And each play of Lord Dunsany 's is an exciting adventure , conveying to the reader an exhilarating sense of motion without ever descending to old-fashioned stage tricks for the production of that sense . This means that they combine to an extraordinary degree the qualities which make separately for theatrical or literary success . EDWIN BJOeRKMAN .</p>

       <p>There has been a comet come near to the earth of late and the earth has been parched and sultry so that the gods are drowsy and all those things that are divine in man , such as benevolence , drunkenness , extravagance , and song , have faded and died and have not been replenished by the gods .</p>

       <speaker>ILLANAUN</speaker>
       <p>I am sorry . I cannot help you . There have been too many beggars here and we must decline alms for the good of the town .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>ULF</speaker>
       <p>And there will be good eating .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SLAG</speaker>
       <p><stage>in an undertone to Ulf</stage>But you do not know my master . Now that you have suggested that we shall go as lords , he will make a better suggestion . He will suggest that we should go as kings .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ULF</speaker>
       <p>Beggars as kings !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SLAG</speaker>
       <p>Ay . You do not know my master .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ULF</speaker>
       <p><stage>to Agmar</stage>What do you bid us do ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>AGMAR</speaker>
       <p>You shall first come by the fine raiment in the manner I have mentioned .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ULF</speaker>
       <p>And what then , master ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>AGMAR</speaker>
       <p>Why , then we shall go as gods .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BEGGARS</speaker>
       <p>As gods !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>AGMAR</speaker>
       <p>As gods . Know you the land through which I have lately come in my wanderings ? Marma , where the gods are carved from green stone in the mountains . They sit all seven of them against the hills . They sit there motionless and travellers worship them .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ULF</speaker>
       <p>Yes , yes , we know those gods . They are much reverenced here , but they are drowsy and send us nothing beautiful .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>AGMAR</speaker>
       <p>They are of green jade . They sit cross-legged with their right elbows resting on their left hands , the right forefinger pointing upward . We will come into the city disguised , from the direction of Marma , and will claim to be these gods . We must be seven as they are . And when we sit we must sit cross-legged as they do , with the right hand uplifted .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ULF</speaker>
       <p>This is a bad city in which to fall into the hands of oppressors , for the judges lack amiability here as the merchants lack benevolence , ever since the gods forgot them .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>AGMAR</speaker>
       <p>In our ancient calling a man may sit at one street corner for fifty years doing the one thing , and yet a day may come when it is well for him to rise up and do another thing while the timorous man starves .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ULF</speaker>
       <p>Also it were well not to anger the gods .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>AGMAR</speaker>
       <p>Is not all life a beggary to the gods ? Do they not see all men always begging of them and asking alms with incense , and bells , and subtle devices ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OOGNO</speaker>
       <p>Yes , all men indeed are beggars before the gods .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>AGMAR</speaker>
       <p>Does not the mighty Soldan often sit by the agate altar in his royal temple as we sit at a street corner or by a palace gate ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ULF</speaker>
       <p>It is even so .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>AGMAR</speaker>
       <p>Then will the gods be glad when we follow the holy calling with new devices and with subtlety , as they are glad when the priests sing a new song .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ULF</speaker>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SLAG</speaker>
       <p>Yes , master . Shall I make the prophecy myself ? Or shall it be found in some old document ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>AGMAR</speaker>
       <p>Let someone have seen it once in some rare document . Let it be spoken of in the market place .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SLAG</speaker>
       <p>It shall be spoken of , master .</p>

       <p>Our little sister the moon . She comes to us at evenings away in the mountains of Marma . She trips over the mountains when she is young . When she is young and slender she comes and dances before us , and when she is old and unshapely she hobbles away from the hills .</p>

      <sp>

       <p>Yet is she young again and forever nimble with youth ; yet she comes dancing back . The years are not able to curb her nor to bring gray hairs to her brethren .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>CITIZEN</speaker>
       <p>I heard men speak to-day in the market place . They speak of a prophecy read somewhere of old . It says the seven gods shall come from Marma in the guise of men .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>ILLANAUN</speaker>
       <p>Is this a true prophecy ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OORANDER</speaker>
       <p>It is all the prophecy we have . Man without prophecy is like a sailor going by night over uncharted seas . He knows not where are the rocks nor where the havens . To the man on watch all things ahead are black and the stars guide him not , for he knows not what they are .</p>

       <p>Should we not investigate this prophecy ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OORANDER</speaker>
       <p>Let us accept it . It is as the small , uncertain light of a lantern , carried it may be by a drunkard , but along the shore of some haven . Let us be guided .</p>

Sometimes the gods , being pacific , are pleased to have roasted instead the flesh of lamb . It is all one to the gods ; let the roasting stop .</p>

      <stage>They listen . No one speaks . The stony boots come on . Enter in single file through door in right of back , a procession of seven green men , even hands and faces are green ; they wear greenstone sandals ; they walk with knees extremely wide apart , as having sat cross-legged for centuries ; their right arms and right forefingers point upward , right elbows resting on left hands ; they stoop grotesquely . Halfway to the footlights they left wheel . They pass in front of the seven beggars , now in terrified attitudes , and six of them sit down in the attitude described , with their backs to the audience . The leader stands , still stooping .</stage>

When the six are seated the leader points one by one at each of the seven beggars , shooting out his forefinger at them . As he does this each beggar in his turn gathers himself back on to his throne and crosses his legs , his right arm goes stiffly upward with forefinger erect , and a staring look of horror comes into his eyes . In this attitude the beggars sit motionless while a green light falls upon their faces . The gods go out .</stage>Presently enter the Citizens , some with victuals and fruit .

      <p>Why do you say “ the stars spare him ” ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FIRST SENTRY</speaker>
      <p>Because if a doom from the stars fall suddenly on a king it swallows up his people and all things round about him , and his palace falls and the walls of his city and citadel , and the apes come in from the woods and the large beasts from the desert , so that you would not say that a king had been there at all .</p>

      <speaker>FIRST SENTRY</speaker>
      <p>Because he seldom placates them .</p>

      <p>Who are the stars that a man should scorn them ? Should they that rule the thunder , the plague and the earthquake withhold these things save for much prayer ? Always ambassadors are with the King , and his commanders , come in from distant lands , prefects of cities and makers of the laws , but never the priests of the stars .</p>

      <p>Why have you grown uneasy about this war in the hills ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FIRST SENTRY</speaker>
      <p>Because the King is powerful beyond any of his fathers , and has more fighting men , more horses , and wealth that could have ransomed his father and his grandfather and dowered their queens and daughters ; and every year his miners bring him more from the opal-mines and from the turquoise-quarries . He has grown very mighty .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SECOND SENTRY</speaker>
      <p>Then he will the more easily crush the hill-folk in a little war .</p>

No . 2 comes back . They do not speak . Both whistle . No . 3 comes . All examine the door . Enter the King and his Chamberlain . The King wears a purple robe . The Sentries smartly transfer their spears to their left hands and return their right arms to their right sides . They then lower their spears until their points are within an inch of the ground , at the same time raising their right hands above their heads . They stand for some moments thus . Then they lower their right arms to their right sides , at the same time raising their spears . In the next motion they take their spears into their right hands and lower the butts to the floor , where they were before , the spears slanting forward a little . Both Sentries must move together precisely .</stage>

      <p>Not for myself I have a fear of doom , not for myself ; but I inherited a rocky land , windy and ill-nurtured , and nursed it to prosperity by years of peace and spread its boundaries by years of war . I have brought up harvests out of barren acres and given good laws unto naughty towns , and my people are happy , and lo , the stars are angry !</p>

      <speaker>CHAMBERLAIN</speaker>

       <item>The dinner-hour on the slave-fields of King Darniak . King Argimenes is sitting upon the ground , bowed , ragged and dirty , gnawing a bone . He has uncouth hair and a dishevelled beard . A battered spade lies near him . Two or three slaves sit at back of stage eating raw cabbage-leaves . The tear-song , the chant of the low-born , rises at intervals , monotonous and mournful , coming from distant slave-fields .</item>
       <item>KING ARGIMENES</item>
       <item>This is a good bone ; there is juice in this bone .</item>

       <item>KING ARGIMENES</item>
       <item>I am not to be envied any longer . I have eaten up my bone .</item>
       <item>ZARB</item>
       <item>I wish I were you , because you have been a king . Because men have prostrated themselves before your feet . Because you have ridden a horse and worn a crown and have been called Majesty .</item>

       <item>When I remember that I have been a king it is very terrible .</item>
       <item>ZARB</item>
       <item>But you are lucky to have such things in your memory as you have . I have nothing in my memory — Once I went for a year without being flogged , and I remember my cleverness in contriving it — I have nothing else to remember .</item>
       <item>KING ARGIMENES</item>
       <item>It is very terrible to have been a king .</item>
       <item>ZARB</item>
       <item>But we have nothing who have no good memories in the past . It is not easy for us to hope for the future here .</item>

       <item>Have you any god ?</item>
       <item>ZARB</item>
       <item>We may not have a god because he might make us brave and we might kill our guards . He might make a miracle and give us swords .</item>
       <item>KING ARGIMENES</item>
       <item>Ah , you have no hope , then .</item>
       <item>ZARB</item>
       <item>I have a little hope . Hush , and I will tell you a secret — The King 's great dog is ill and like to die . They will throw him to us . We shall have beautiful bones then .</item>
       <item>KING ARGIMENES</item>
       <item>Ah ! Bones .</item>
       <item>ZARB</item>
       <item>Yes . That is what I hope for . And have you no other hope ? Do you not hope that your nation will arise some day and rescue you and cast off the king and hang him up by his thumbs from the palace gateway ?</item>
       <item>KING ARGIMENES</item>
       <item>No . I have no other hope , for my god was cast down in the temple and broken into three pieces on the day that they surprised us and took me sleeping . But will they throw him to us ? Will so honorable a brute as the King 's dog be thrown to us ?</item>

     <p>KING ARGIMENES</p>
     <stage>We are not worms !</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>You do not understand , Argimenes . The worms are little and free , while we are big and enslaved . I did not say we were worms , but we are like worms , and if they have the King when he is dead , why then —</stage>
     <p>KING ARGIMENES</p>
     <stage>Tell me more of the King 's dog . Are there big bones on him ?</stage>

     <stage>Ay , he is a big dog — a high , big , black one .</stage>
     <p>KING ARGIMENES</p>
     <stage>You know him then ?</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>Oh yes , I know him . I know him well . I was beaten once because of him , twenty-five strokes from the treble whips , two men beating me .</stage>
     <p>KING ARGIMENES</p>
     <stage>How did they beat you because of the King 's dog ?</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>They beat me because I spoke to him without making obeisance . He was coming dancing along over the slave-fields and I spoke to him . He was a friendly great dog , and I spoke to him and patted his head , and did not make obeisance .</stage>
     <p>KING ARGIMENES</p>
     <stage>And they saw you do it ?</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>Yes , the slave-guard saw me . They came and seized me at once and bound my arms . The great dog wanted me to speak to him again , but I was hurried away .</stage>
     <p>KING ARGIMENES</p>
     <stage>You should have made obeisance .</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>The great dog seemed so friendly that I forgot he was the King 's great dog .</stage>
     <p>KING ARGIMENES</p>
     <stage>But tell me more . Was he hurt or is it a sickness ?</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>They say that it is a sickness .</stage>
     <p>KING ARGIMENES</p>
     <stage>Ah , then he will grow thin if he does not die soon . If it had been a hurt !— but we should not complain . I complain more often than you do because I had not learned to submit while I was yet young .</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>If your beautiful memories do not please you , you should hope more . I wish I had your memories . I should not trouble to hope then . It is very hard to hope .</stage>
     <p>KING ARGIMENES</p>
     <stage>There will be nothing more to hope for when we have eaten the King 's dog .</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>Why , you might find gold in the earth while you were digging . Then you might bribe the commander of the guard to lend you his sword ; we would all follow you if you had a sword . Then we might take the King and bind him and lay him on the ground and fasten his tongue outside his mouth with thorns and put honey on it and sprinkle honey near . Then the gray ants would come from one of their big mounds . My father found gold once when he was digging .</stage>
     <stage>KING ARGIMENES ( pointedly )</stage>
     <stage>Did your father free himself ?</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>No . Because the King 's Overseer found him looking at the gold and killed him . But he would have freed himself if he could have bribed the guard .</stage>
     <stage>[ A Prophet walks across the stage attended by two guards .</stage>

     <stage>Going to prophesy good things to the King . It is easy to prophesy good things to a king , and be rewarded when the good things come . What else should come to a king ? A prophet ! A prophet !</stage>
     <stage>[ A deep bell tolls slowly . King Argimenes and Zarb pick up their spades at once , and the old slaves at the back of the stage go down on their knees immediately and grub in the soil with their hands . The white beard of the oldest trails in the dirt as he works . King Argimenes digs .</stage>
     <p>KING ARGIMENES</p>
     <stage>What is the name of that song that we always sing ? I like the song .</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>It has no name . It is our song . There is no other song .</stage>
     <p>KING ARGIMENES</p>
     <stage>Once there were other songs . Has this no name ?</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>I think the soldiers have a name for it .</stage>
     <p>KING ARGIMENES</p>
     <stage>What do the soldiers call it ?</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>The soldiers call it the tear-song , the chant of the low-born .</stage>
     <p>KING ARGIMENES</p>
     <stage>It is a good song . I could sing no other now .</stage>
     <stage>[ Zarb moves away digging .</stage>
     <stage>KING ARGIMENES ( to himself as his spade touches something in the earth )</stage>
     <stage>Metal ! ( Feels with his spade again ) Gold perhaps !— It is of no use here . ( Uncovers earth leisurely . Suddenly he drops on his knees and works excitedly in the earth with his hands . Then very slowly , still kneeling , he lifts , lying flat on his hands , a long greenish sword , his eyes intent on it . About the level of his uplifted forehead he holds it , still flat on both hands , and addresses it thus ) O holy and blessed thing ! ( Then he lowers it slowly till his hands rest on his knees , and looking all the while at the sword , loquitur ) Three years ago to-morrow King Darniak spat at me , having taken my kingdom from me . Three times in that year I was flogged , with twelve stripes , with seventeen stripes , and with twenty stripes . A year and eleven months ago , come Moon-day , the King 's Overseer struck me in the face , and nine times in that year he called me dog . For one month two weeks and a day I was yoked with a bullock and pulled a rounded stone all day over the paths , except while we were fed . I was flogged twice that year — with eighteen stripes and with ten stripes . This year the roof of the slave-sty has fallen in and King Darniak will not repair it . Five weeks ago one of his Queens laughed at me as she came across the slave-fields . I was flogged again this year and with thirteen stripes , and twelve times they have called me dog . And these things they have done to a king , and a king of the House of Ithara . ( He listens attentively for a moment , then buries the sword again and pats the earth over it with his hands , then digs again )</stage>
     <stage>[ The old slaves do not see him : their faces are to the earth . Enter the King 's Overseer carrying a whip . The slaves and King Argimenes kneel with their foreheads to the ground as he passes across the stage . Exit the King 's Overseer .</stage>
     <stage>KING ARGIMENES ( kneeling , hands outspread downward )</stage>
     <stage>O warrior spirit , wherever thou wanderest , whoever be thy gods , whether they punish thee or whether they bless thee , O kingly spirit , that once laid here this sword , behold , I pray to thee , having no gods to pray to , for the god of my nation was broken in three by night . Mine arm is stiff with three years ’ slavery , and remembers not the sword . But guide thy sword till I have slain six men and armed the strongest slaves , and thou shalt have the sacrifice every year of a hundred goodly oxen . And I will build in Ithara a temple to thy memory wherein all that enter in shall remember thee ; so shalt thou be honored and envied among the dead , for the dead are very jealous of remembrance . Ay , though thou wert a robber that took men 's lives unrighteously , yet shall rare spices smoulder in thy temple and little maidens sing and new-plucked flowers deck the solemn aisles ; and priests shall go about it ringing bells that thy soul shall find repose . Oh , but it has a good blade , this old green sword ; thou wouldst not like to see it miss its mark ( if the dead see at all , as wise men teach ) , thou wouldst not like to see it go thirsting into the air ; so huge a sword should find its marrowy bone . ( Extending his right hand upward ) Come into my right arm , O ancient spirit , O unknown warrior 's soul ! And if thou hast the ear of any gods , speak there against Illuriel , god of King Darniak . ( He rises and goes on digging )</stage>
     <stage>THE KING 'S OVERSEER ( reentering )</stage>
     <stage>So you have been praying .</stage>
     <stage>KING ARGIMENES ( kneeling )</stage>
     <stage>No , master .</stage>
     <p>THE KING 'S OVERSEER</p>
     <stage>The slave-guard saw you . ( Strikes him ) It is not lawful for a slave to pray .</stage>
     <p>KING ARGIMENES</p>
     <stage>I did but pray to Illuriel to make me a good slave , to teach me to dig well and to pull the rounded stone and to make me not to die when the food is scarce , but to be a good slave to my master the great King .</stage>
     <p>THE KING 'S OVERSEER</p>
     <stage>Who art thou to pray to Illuriel ? Dogs may not pray to an immortal god . ( Exit )</stage>
     <stage>[ Zarb comes back , digging .</stage>
     <stage>KING ARGIMENES ( digging )</stage>
     <stage>Zarb !</stage>
     <stage>ZARB ( also digging )</stage>
     <stage>Do not look at me when you speak . The guards are watching us . Look at your digging .</stage>
     <p>KING ARGIMENES</p>
     <stage>How do the guards know we are speaking because we look at one another ?</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>You are very witless . Of course they know .</stage>
     <p>KING ARGIMENES</p>
     <stage>Zarb !</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>What is it ?</stage>
     <p>KING ARGIMENES</p>
     <stage>How many guards are there in sight ?</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>There are six of them over there . They are watching us .</stage>
     <p>KING ARGIMENES</p>
     <stage>Are there other guards in sight of these six guards ?</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>No .</stage>
     <p>KING ARGIMENES</p>
     <stage>How do you know ?</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>Because whenever their officer leaves them they sit upon the ground and play with dice .</stage>
     <p>KING ARGIMENES</p>
     <stage>How does that show that there are not another six in sight of them ?</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>How witless you are , Argimenes ! Of course it shows there are not . Because , if there were , another officer would see them , and their thumbs would be cut off .</stage>
     <p>KING ARGIMENES</p>
     <stage>Ah ! ( A pause ) Zarb ! ( A pause ) Would the slaves follow me if I tried to kill the guards ?</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>No , Argimenes .</stage>
     <p>KING ARGIMENES</p>
     <stage>Why would they not follow me ?</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>Because you look like a slave . They will never follow a slave , because they are slaves themselves , and know how mean a creature is a slave . If you looked like a king they would follow you .</stage>
     <p>KING ARGIMENES</p>
     <stage>But I am a king . They know that I am a king .</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>It is better to look like a king . It is looks that they would go by .</stage>
     <p>KING ARGIMENES</p>
     <stage>If I had a sword would they follow me ? A beautiful huge sword of bronze .</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>I wish I could think of things like that . It is because you were once a king that you can think of a sword of bronze . I tried to hope once that I should some day fight the guards , but I could n't picture a sword , I could n't imagine it ; I could only picture whips .</stage>
     <p>KING ARGIMENES</p>
     <stage>Dig a little nearer , Zarb . ( They both edge closer ) I have found a very old sword in the earth . It is not a sword such as common soldiers wear . A king must have worn it , and an angry king . It must have done fearful things ; there are little dints in it . Perhaps there was a battle here long ago where all were slain , and perhaps that king died last and buried his sword , but the great birds swallowed him .</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>You have been thinking too much of the King 's dog , Argimenes , and that has made you hungry , and hunger has driven you mad .</stage>
     <p>KING ARGIMENES</p>
     <stage>I have found such a sword . [ A pause .</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>Why — then you will wear a purple cloak again , and sit on a great throne , and ride a prancing horse , and we shall call you Majesty .</stage>
     <p>KING ARGIMENES</p>
     <stage>I shall break a long fast first and drink much water , and sleep . But will the slaves follow me ?</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>You will make them follow you if you have a sword . Yet is Illuriel a very potent god . They say that none have prevailed against King Darniak 's dynasty so long as Illuriel stood . Once an enemy cast Illuriel into the river and overthrew the dynasty , but a fisherman found him again and set him up , and the enemy was driven out and the dynasty returned .</stage>
     <p>KING ARGIMENES</p>
     <stage>If Illuriel could be cast down as my god was cast down perhaps King Darniak could be overcome as I was overcome in my sleep ?</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>If Illuriel were cast down all the people would utter a cry and flee away . It would be a fearful portent .</stage>
     <p>KING ARGIMENES</p>
     <stage>How many men are there in the armory at the palace ?</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>There are ten men in the palace armory when all the slave-guards are out .</stage>
     <stage>[ They dig awhile in silence .</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>The officer of the slave-guard has gone away — They are playing with dice now . ( He throws down his spade and stretches his arms ) The man with the big beard has won again , he is very nimble with his thumbs — They are playing again , but it is getting dark , I cannot clearly see .</stage>
     <stage>[ King Argimenes furtively uncovers the sword , he picks it up and grips it in his hand .</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>Majesty !</stage>
     <stage>[ King Argimenes crouches and steals away towards the slave-guard .</stage>
     <stage>ZARB ( to the other slaves )</stage>
     <stage>Argimenes has found a terrible sword and has gone to slay the slave-guard . It is not a common sword , it is some king 's sword .</stage>
     <p>AN OLD SLAVE</p>
     <stage>Argimenes will be dreadfully flogged . We shall hear him cry all night . His cries will frighten us , and we shall not sleep .</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>No , no ! The guards flog poor slaves , but Argimenes had an angry look . The guards will be afraid when they see him look so angry and see his terrible sword . It was a huge sword , and he looked very angry . He will bring us the swords of the slave-guard . We must prostrate ourselves before him and kiss his feet or he will be angry with us too .</stage>
     <p>OLD SLAVE</p>
     <stage>Will Argimenes give me a sword ?</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>He will have swords for six of us if he slays the slave-guard . Yes , he will give you a sword .</stage>
     <p>SLAVE</p>
     <stage>A sword ! No , no , I must not ; the King would kill me if he found that I had a sword .</stage>
     <stage>SECOND SLAVE ( slowly , as one who develops an idea )</stage>
     <stage>If the King found that I had a sword , why , then it would be an evil day for the King .</stage>
     <stage>[ They all look off left .</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>I think that they are playing at dice again .</stage>
     <p>FIRST SLAVE</p>
     <stage>I do not see Argimenes .</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>No , because he was crouching as he walked . The slave-guard is on the sky-line .</stage>
     <p>SECOND SLAVE</p>
     <stage>What is that dark shadow behind the slave-guard ?</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>It is too still to be Argimenes .</stage>
     <p>SECOND SLAVE</p>
     <stage>Look ! It moves .</stage>
     <p>ZARB</p>
     <stage>The evening is too dark , I cannot see .</stage>
     <stage>[ They continue to gaze into the gathering darkness . They raise themselves on their knees and crane their necks . Nobody speaks . Then from their lips and from others farther off goes up a long , deep “ Oh ! ” It is like the sound that goes up from the grandstand when a horse falls at a fence , or , in England , like the first exclamation of the crowd at a great cricket match when a man is caught in the slips .</stage>

His Queens are seated about him on the ground , two on his right and two between him and the idol . All wear crowns . Beside the dark-green idol a soldier with a pike is kneeling upon one knee . The tear-song , the chant of the low-born , drifts faintly up from the slave-fields .</stage>

       <p><stage>speaks at once in a loud voice</stage>There was once a King that had slaves to hate him and to toil for him , and he had soldiers to guard him and to die for him . And the number of the slaves that he had to hate him and to toil for him was greater than the number of the soldiers that he had to guard him and to die for him . And the days of that King were few . And the number of thy slaves , O King , that thou hast to hate thee is greater than the number of thy soldiers .</p>

      <stage>The King , who has been smiling at Atharlia , gives a gracious nod to the Prophet when he hears him stop speaking . When the Queens see the King nod graciously , they applaud the Prophet by idly clapping their hands .</stage>

       <speaker>THE PROPHET</speaker>
       <p>Thine armies camped upon thy mountainous borders descry no enemy in the plains afar . And within thy gates lurks he for whom thy sentinels seek upon lonely guarded frontiers .

      <stage>When the Queens come to the doorway they halt on each side of it . Then they turn facing one another . Then the King leaves his throne and passes between them into the Chamber of Banquets , each couple courtseying low to him as he passes . The Queens follow , then the attendants . There rises the wine-song , the chant of the nobles , drowning the chant of the low-born . Only the Idol-Guard remains behind , still kneeling beside Illuriel .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>THE IDOL-GUARD</speaker>
       <p>I do not like those things the Prophet said — It would be terrible if they were true — It would be very terrible if they were false , for he prophesies in the name of Illuriel — Ah ! They are singing the wine-song , the chant of the nobles . The Queens are singing . How merry they are !— I should like to be a noble and sit and look at the Queens .<stage>He joins in the song</stage></p>

      <speaker>THE GLITTERING GATE</speaker>
      <p>The Lonely Place is strewn with large black rocks and uncorked beer-bottles , the latter in great profusion . At back is a wall of granite built of great slabs , and in it the Gate of Heaven . The door is of gold . Below the Lonely Place is an abyss hung with stars . The rising curtain reveals Jim wearily uncorking a beer-bottle . Then he tilts it slowly and with infinite care . It proves to be empty . Faint and unpleasant laughter is heard off . This action and the accompanying far laughter are repeated continually throughout the play . Corked bottles are discovered lying behind rocks , and more descend constantly through the air , within reach of Jim . All prove to be empty . Jim uncorks a few bottles .</p>

I 've been walking along under this wall ever since . Why , it must be twenty-four hours since that house-holder shot me . And he need n't have done it , either , I was n't going to hurt the bloke . I only wanted a bit of his silver stuff . It felt funny , that did . Hullo , a gate . Why , that 's the Gate of Heaven . Well , well . So that 's all right .<stage>Looks up and up for some time</stage>No . I can n't climb that wall . Why , it 's got no top to it . Up and up it goes .<stage>Knocks at the door and waits</stage></p>

      <p>I am ‘ ere always .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <p>Why , Jim , do n't you remember me ? Why , you taught Bill to pick locks years and years ago when he was a little boy , and had never learnt a trade and had n't a penny in the world , and never would have had but for you , Jim .<stage>Jim stares vaguely</stage>I never forgot you , Jim . I broke into scores of houses . And then I took on big houses . Out in the country , you know , real big ones . I got rich , Jim , and respected by all who knew me . I was a citizen , Jim , one who dwelt in our midst . And of an evening , sitting over the fire , I used to say , “ I am as clever as Jim . ” But I was n't , Jim . I could n't climb like you . And I could n't walk like you on a creaky stair , when everything 's quite still and there 's a dog in the house and little rattly things left lying about , and a door that whines if you touch it , and someone ill upstairs that you did n't know of , who has nothing to do but to listen for you ‘ cause she can n't get to sleep . Do n't you remember little Bill ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <p>That would be somewhere else .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <p>Yes , Jim , yes . Down on Earth .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <p>But there is n't anywhere else .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <p>I never forgot you , Jim . I 'd be pattering away with my tongue , in Church , like all the rest , but all the time I 'd be thinking of you in that little room at Putney and the man searching every corner of it for you with a revolver in one hand and a candle in the other , and you almost going round with him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <p>What is Putney ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <p>Oh , Jim , can n't you remember ? Ca n't you remember the day you taught me a livelihood ? I was n't more than twelve , and it was spring , and all the may was in blossom outside the town . And we cleared out No . 25 in the new street . And next day we saw the man 's fat , silly face . It was thirty years ago .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <p>What are years ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <p>Oh , Jim !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <p>You see there is n't any hope here . And when there is n't any hope there is n't any future . And when there is n't any future there is n't any past . It 's just the present here . I tell you we 're stuck . There are n't no years here . Nor no nothing .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <p>Cheer up , Jim . You 're thinking of a quotation , “ Abandon hope , all ye that enter here . ” I used to learn quotations ; they are awfully genteel . A fellow called Shakespeare used to make them . But there is n't any sense in them . What 's the use of saying ye when you mean you ? Do n't be thinking of quotations , Jim .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <p>I tell you there is no hope here .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <p>Cheer up , Jim . There 's plenty of hope there , is n't there ?<stage>Points to the Gate of Heaven</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <p>Yes , and that 's why they keep it locked up so . They wo n't let us have any . No . I begin to remember Earth again now since you 've been speaking . It was just the same there . The more they 'd got the more they wanted to keep you from having a bit .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <p>You 'll cheer up a bit when I tell you what I 've got . I say , Jim , have you got some beer ? Why , so you have . Why , you ought to cheer up , Jim .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <p>All the beer you 're ever likely to see again . They 're empty .</p>

      <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <p><stage>half rising from the rock on which he has seated himself , and pointing his finger at Jim as he rises ; very cheerfully</stage>Why , you 're the chap that said there was no hope here , and you 're hoping to find beer in every bottle you open .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <p>Yes ; I hope to see a drop of beer in one some day , but I know I wo n't . Their trick might not work just once .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <p>It is n't any good to you whatever it is . Not even if it is a ten-pound note .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <p>It 's better than a ten-pound note , Jim . Jim , try and remember , Jim . Do n't you remember the way we used to go for those iron safes ? Do you remember anything , Jim ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <p>Yes , I am beginning to remember now . There used to be sunsets . And then there were great yellow lights . And one went in behind them through a swinging door .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <p>Yes , yes , Jim . That was the Blue Bear down at Wimbledon .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <p>Yes , and the room was all full of golden light . And there was beer with light in it , and some would be spilt on the counter and there was light in that too . And there was a girl standing there with yellow hair . She 'd be the other side of that door now , with lamplight in her hair among the angels , and the old smile on her lips if one of them chaffed her , and her pretty teeth a-shining . She would be very near the throne ; there was never any harm in Jane .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <p>No , there was never any ‘ arm in Jane , Jim .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <p>Oh , I do n't want to see the angels , Bill . But if I could see Jane again<stage>points in direction of laugh</stage>he might laugh as much as he cared to whenever I wanted to cry . You can n't cry here , you know , Bill .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <p>You shall see her again , Jim .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Jim takes no interest in this remark ; he lowers his eyes and goes on with his work .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <p>Jim , you shall see her again . You want to get into Heaven , do n't you ?</p>

      <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <p>You remember those iron safes , Jim , how we used to knock them open like walnuts with “ Old Nut-cracker ” ?</p>

      <p>Well , I 've got Old Nut-cracker . I had him in my hand at the time , and they let me keep him . They thought it would be a nice proof against me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <p>Nothing is any good here .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <p>I 'll get in to Heaven , Jim . And you shall come with me because you taught me a livelihood . I could n't be happy there , like those angels , if I knew of anyone being outside . I 'm not like that .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Jim goes on with his work .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <p>Jim , Jim . You 'll see Jane there .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <p>You 'll never get through those gates , Bill . You 'll never do it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <p>They 're only gold , Jim . Gold 's soft like lead . Old Nut-cracker would do it if they were steel .</p>

      <p>You 'll never do it , Bill .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Bill puts a rock against the gates , stands on it to reach the lock and gets to work on the lock . A good instrument to use is an egg-whipper . Jim goes on wearily with his work . As Bill works away , fragments and golden screws begin to fall on the floor .</stage>
     <sp>

     <sp>
      <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <p>Suppose it 's a mile thick . Suppose it 's a million miles thick . Suppose it 's a hundred million miles thick .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <p>Ca n't be , Jim . These doors are meant to open outward . They could n't do that if they were more than four inches at the most , not for an Archbishop . They 'd stick .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <p>You remember that great safe we broke open once , what had coal in it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <p>This is n't a safe , Jim , this is Heaven . There 'll be the old saints with their halos shining and flickering , like windows o ’ wintry nights .<stage>Creak , creak , creak</stage>And angels thick as swallows along a cottage roof the day before they go .<stage>Creak , creak , creak</stage>And orchards full of apples as far as you can see , and the rivers of Tigris and Euphrates , so the Bible says ; and a city of gold , for those that care for cities , all full of precious stones ; but I 'm a bit tired of cities and precious stones .<stage>Creak , creak , creak</stage>I 'll go out into the fields where the orchards are , by the Tigris and the Euphrates . I should n't be surprised if my old mother was there . She never cared much for the way I earned my livelihood<stage>creak , creak</stage>, but she was a good mother to me . I do n't know if they want a good mother in there who would be kind to the angels and sit and smile at them when they sang and soothe them if they were cross . If they let all the good ones in she 'll be there all right .<stage>Suddenly</stage>Jim ! They wo n't have brought me up against her , will they ? That 's not fair evidence , Jim .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <p>It would be just like them to . Very like them .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <p>If there 's a glass of beer to be got in Heaven , or a dish of tripe and onions , or a pipe of ‘ bacca she 'll have them for me when I come to her . She used to know my ways wonderful ; and what I liked . And she used to know when to expect me almost anywhere . I used to climb in through the window at any hour and she always knew it was me .<stage>Creak , creak</stage>She 'll know it 's me at the door now , Jim .<stage>Creak , creak</stage>It will be all a blaze of light , and I 'll hardly know it 's her till I get used to it .... But I 'll know her among a million angels . There were n't none like her on Earth and there wo n't be none like her in Heaven .... Jim ! I 'm through , Jim ! One more turn , and old Nut-cracker 's done it ! It 's giving ! It 's giving ! I know the feel of it . Jim !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>At last there is a noise of falling bolts ; the gates swing out an inch and are stopped by the rock .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <p>Jim ! Jim ! I 've opened it , Jim . I 've opened the Gate of Heaven ! Come and help me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <p><stage>looks up for a moment with open mouth . Then he mournfully shakes his head and goes on drawing a cork</stage>Another one empty .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <p><stage>looks down once into the abyss that lies below the Lonely Place</stage>Stars . Blooming great stars .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Then he moves away the rock on which he stood . The gates move slowly . Jim leaps up and runs to help ; they each take a gate and move backward with their faces against it .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <p>Hullo , mother ! You there ? Hullo ! You there ? It 's Bill , mother .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>The gates swing heavily open , revealing empty night and stars .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BILL</speaker>
      <p><stage>staggering and gazing into the revealed Nothing , in which far stars go wandering</stage>Stars . Blooming great stars . There ai n't no Heaven , Jim .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Ever since the revelation a cruel and violent laugh has arisen off . It increases in volume and grows louder and louder .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIM</speaker>
      <p>That 's like them . That 's very like them . Yes , they 'd do that ! The curtain falls and the laughter still howls on .</p>

      <speaker>THE LOST SILK HAT</speaker>
      <p>The Caller stands on a doorstep , “ faultlessly dressed , ” but without a hat . At first he shows despair , then a new thought engrosses him .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Enter the Laborer .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE CALLER</speaker>
      <p>Excuse me a moment . Excuse me — but — I 'd be greatly obliged to you if — if you could see your way — in fact , you can be of great service to me if —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE LABORER</speaker>
      <p>Glad to do what I can , sir .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>Well , all I really want you to do is just to ring that bell and go up and say — er — say that you 've come to see to the drains , or anything like that , you know , and get hold of my hat for me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LABORER</speaker>
      <p>Get hold of your ‘ at !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>Yes . You see , I left my hat behind most unfortunately . It 's in the drawing-room<stage>points to window</stage>, that room there , half under the long sofa , the far end from the door . And if you could possibly go and get it , why I 'd be<stage>The Laborer 's expression changes</stage>— Why , what 's the matter ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LABORER</speaker>
      <p><stage>firmly</stage>I do n't like this job .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>Do n't like this job ! But my dear fellow , do n't be silly , what possible harm —?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LABORER</speaker>
      <p>Ah-h. That 's what I do n't know .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>But what harm can there possibly be in so simple a request ? What harm does there seem to be ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LABORER</speaker>
      <p>Oh , it seems all right .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>Well , then .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LABORER</speaker>
      <p>All these crack jobs do seem all right .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>But I 'm not asking you to rob the house .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LABORER</speaker>
      <p>Do n't seem as if you are , certainly , but I do n't like the looks of it ; what if there 's things what I can n't ‘ elp taking when I gets inside ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>I only want my hat — Here , I say , please do n't go away — here 's a sovereign , it will only take you a minute .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LABORER</speaker>
      <p>What I want to know —</p>

      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>Yes ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LABORER</speaker>
      <p>— Is what 's in that hat ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>What 's in the hat ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LABORER</speaker>
      <p>Yes ; that 's what I want to know .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>What 's in the hat ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LABORER</speaker>
      <p>Yes , you are n't going to give me a sovereign —?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>I 'll give you two sovereigns .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LABORER</speaker>
      <p>You are n't going to give me a sovereign , and rise it to two sovereigns , for an empty hat ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>But I must have my hat . I can n't be seen in the streets like this . There 's nothing in the hat . What do you think 's in the hat ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LABORER</speaker>
      <p>Ah , I 'm not clever enough to say that , but it looks as if the papers was in that hat .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>The papers ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LABORER</speaker>
      <p>Yes , papers proving , if you can get them , that you 're the heir to that big house , and some poor innocent will be defrauded .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>Look here , the hat 's absolutely empty . I must have my hat . If there 's anything in it you shall have it yourself as well as the two pounds , only get me my hat .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LABORER</speaker>
      <p>Well , that seems all right .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>That 's right , then you 'll run up and get it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LABORER</speaker>
      <p>Seems all right to me and seems all right to you . But it 's the police what you and I have got to think of . Will it seem all right to them ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p>Oh , for heaven 's sake —</p>

      <p>Ah !</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>Excuse me , sir . Excuse my asking you , but , as you see , I am without a hat . I shall be extraordinarily obliged to you if you would be so very good as to get it for me . Pretend you have come to wind the clocks , you know . I left it in the drawing-room of this house , half under the long sofa , the far end .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CLERK</speaker>
      <p>Oh , er — all right , only —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>Thanks so much , I am immensely indebted to you . Just say you 've come to wind the clocks , you know .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CLERK</speaker>
      <p>I — er — do n't think I 'm very good at winding clocks , you know .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>Oh , that 's all right , just stand in front of the clock and fool about with it . That 's all they ever do . I must warn you there 's a lady in the room .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CLERK</speaker>
      <p>Oh !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>But that 's all right , you know . Just walk past up to the clock .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CLERK</speaker>
      <p>But I think , if you do n't mind , as there 's someone there —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>Oh , but she 's quite young and very , very beautiful and —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CLERK</speaker>
      <p>Why do n't you get it yourself ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>That is impossible .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CLERK</speaker>
      <p>Impossible ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>Yes , I have sprained my ankle .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CLERK</speaker>
      <p>Oh ! Is it bad ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>Yes , very bad indeed .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CLERK</speaker>
      <p>I do n't mind trying to carry you up .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>No , that would be worse . My foot has to be kept on the ground .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CLERK</speaker>
      <p>But how will you get home ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>I can walk all right on the flat .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CLERK</speaker>
      <p>I 'm afraid I have to be going on . It 's rather later than I thought .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>But for goodness sake do n't leave me . You can n't leave me here like this without a hat .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CLERK</speaker>
      <p>I 'm afraid I must , it 's later than I thought .</p>

     <stage>Exit</stage>
     <stage>Enter the Poet .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>Excuse me , sir . Excuse my stopping you . But I should be immensely obliged to you if you would do me a very great favor . I have unfortunately left my hat behind while calling at this house . It is half under the long sofa , at the far end . If you could possibly be so kind as to pretend you have come to tune the piano and fetch my hat for me I should be enormously grateful to you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POET</speaker>
      <p>But why cannot you get it for yourself ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>I cannot .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POET</speaker>
      <p>If you would tell me the reason perhaps I could help you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>I cannot . I can never enter that house again .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POET</speaker>
      <p>If you have committed a murder , by all means tell me . I am not sufficiently interested in ethics to wish to have you hanged for it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>Do I look like a murderer ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POET</speaker>
      <p>No , of course not . I am only saying that you can safely trust me , for not only does the statute book and its penalties rather tend to bore me , but murder itself has always had a certain fascination for me . I write delicate and fastidious lyrics , yet , strange as it may appear , I read every murder trial , and my sympathies are always with the prisoner .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>But I tell you I am not a murderer .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POET</speaker>
      <p>Then what have you done ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>I have quarrelled with a lady in that house and have sworn to join the</l>
       <l>Bosnians and die in Africa .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POET</speaker>
      <p>But this is beautiful .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>Unfortunately I forgot my hat .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POET</speaker>
      <p>You go to die for a hopeless love , and in a far country ; it was the wont of the troubadours .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>But you will get my hat for me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POET</speaker>
      <p>That I will gladly do for you . But we must find an adequate reason for entering the house .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>You pretend to tune the piano .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POET</speaker>
      <p>That , unfortunately , is impossible . The sound of a piano being unskilfully handled is to me what the continual drop of cold water on the same part of the head is said to be in countries where that interesting torture is practised . There is —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>But what are we to do ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POET</speaker>
      <p>There is a house where kind friends of mine have given me that security and comfort that are a poet 's necessity . But there was a governess there and a piano . It is years and years since I was able even to see the faces of those friends without an inward shudder .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>Well , we 'll have to think of something else .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POET</speaker>
      <p>You are bringing back to these unhappy days the romance of an age of which the ballads tell us that kings sometimes fought in no other armor than their lady 's nightshirt .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>Yes , but you know first of all I must get my hat .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POET</speaker>
      <p>But why ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>I cannot possibly be seen in the streets without a hat .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POET</speaker>
      <p>Why not ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>It can n't be done .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POET</speaker>
      <p>But you confuse externals with essentials .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>I do n't know what you call essentials , but being decently dressed in</l>
       <l>London seems pretty essential to me .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POET</speaker>
      <p>A hat is not one of the essential things of life .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>I do n't want to appear rude , but my hat is n't quite like yours .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p>Let us sit down and talk of things that matter , things that will be remembered after a hundred years .<stage>They sit</stage>Regarded in this light one sees at once the triviality of hats . But to die , and die beautifully for a hopeless love , that is a thing one could make a lyric about . That is the test of essential things — try and imagine them in a lyric . One could not write a lyric about a hat .</p>

      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>I do n't care whether you could write a lyric about my hat or whether you could n't . All I know is that I am not going to make myself absolutely ridiculous by walking about in London without a hat . Will you get it for me or will you not ?</p>

      <p>To take any part in the tuning of a piano is impossible to me .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>Well , pretend you 've come to look at the radiator . They have one under the window , and I happen to know it leaks .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POET</speaker>
      <p>I suppose it has an artistic decoration on it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>Yes , I think so .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POET</speaker>
      <p>Then I decline to look at it or to go near it . I know these decorations in cast iron . I once saw a pot-bellied Egyptian god , named Bes , and he was meant to be ugly , but he was n't as ugly as these decorations that the twentieth century can make with machinery . What has a plumber got to do with art that he should dare to attempt decoration ?</p>

      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>Then you wo n't help me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POET</speaker>
      <p>I wo n't look at ugly things and I wo n't listen to ugly noises , but if you can think of any reasonable plan I do n't mind helping you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>I can think of nothing else . You do n't look like a plumber or a clock-winder . I can think of nothing more . I have had a terrible ordeal and I am not in the condition to think calmly .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POET</speaker>
      <p>Then you will have to leave your hat to its altered destiny .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>Why can n't you think of a plan ? If you 're a poet , thinking 's rather in your line .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POET</speaker>
      <p>If I could bring my thoughts to contemplate so absurd a thing as a hat for any length of time no doubt I could think of a plan , but the very triviality of the theme seems to scare them away .</p>

      <speaker>POET</speaker>
      <p>For Heaven 's sake , do n't do that ! Think what it means !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>I know it will seem absurd , but not so absurd as walking through London without it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POET</speaker>
      <p>I do n't mean that . But you will make it up . You will forgive each other , and you will marry her and have a family of noisy , pimply children like everyone else , and Romance will be dead . No , do n't ring that bell . Go and buy a bayonet , or whatever one does buy , and join the Bosnians .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>I tell you I can n't without a hat .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POET</speaker>
      <p>What is a hat ! Will you sacrifice for it a beautiful doom ? Think of your bones , neglected and forgotten , lying forlornly because of hopeless love on endless golden sands . “ Lying forlorn ! ” as Keats said . What a word ! Forlorn in Africa . The careless Bedouins going past by day , at night the lion 's roar , the grievous voice of the desert .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>As a matter of fact , I do n't think you 're right in speaking of it as desert . The Bosnians , I believe , are only taking it because it is supposed to be the most fertile land in the world .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POET</speaker>
      <p>What of that ? You will not be remembered by geography and statistics , but by golden-mouthed Romance . And that is how Romance sees Africa .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>Well , I 'm going to get my hat .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POET</speaker>
      <p>Think ! Think ! If you enter by that door you will never fall among the foremost Bosnians . You will never die in a far-off , lonely land to lie by immense Sahara . And she will never weep for your beautiful doom and call herself cruel in vain .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>Hark ! She is playing the piano . It seems to me that she might be unhappy about it for years . I do n't see much good in that .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POET</speaker>
      <p>No . I will comfort her .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>I 'm damned if you do ! Look here ! I do n't mind saying , I 'm damned if you do .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POET</speaker>
      <p>Calm yourself . Calm yourself . I do not mean in that way .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CALLER</speaker>
      <p>Then what on earth do you mean ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POET</speaker>
      <p>I will make songs about your beautiful death , glad songs and sad songs . They shall be glad because they tell again the noble tradition of the troubadours , and sad because they tell of your sorrowful destiny and of your hopeless love . I shall make legends also about your lonely bones , telling perhaps how some Arabian men , finding them in the desert by some oasis , memorable in war , wonder who loved them . And then as I read them to her , she weeps perhaps a little , and I read instead of the glory of the soldier , how it overtops our transitory —</p>

      <p>I appeal to you . I appeal to you in the name of beautiful battles , high deeds , and lost causes ; in the name of love-tales told to cruel maidens and told in vain . In the name of stricken hearts broken like beautiful harp-strings , I appeal to you . I appeal in the ancient holy name of Romance : do not ring that bell .</p>
