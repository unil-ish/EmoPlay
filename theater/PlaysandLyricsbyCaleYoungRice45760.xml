    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>SCENE : A dim Hall , of blended Gothic and Saracenic styles , in the Lusignan Castle , on the island of Cyprus near Famagouste . Around the walls , above faint frescoes portraying the deliverance of Jerusalem by the Crusaders , runs a frieze inlaid with the coats-of-arms of former Lusignan kings . On the left , and back , is a door hung with heavy damask , and in the wall opposite , another . Farther down on the right a few steps , whose railing supports a Greek vase with jasmine , lead through a chapel to the sleeping apartments . In the rear , on either side , are guled lattice windows , and in the centre an open grated door , looking upon a loggia , and , across the garden below , over the moonlit sea . Seats are placed about , and , forward , a divan with rich Turkish coverings . A table with a lighted cross-shaped candlestick is by the door , left ; and a lectern with a book on it , to the front , right . As the curtain rises , the Women , except CIVA , lean wearily on the divan , and HALIL near is singing dreamily ,</stage>
     <stage>Ah , the balm , the balm , And ah , the blessing Of the deep fall of night And of confessing . Of the sick soul made white Of all distressing : Made white !... Ah , balm of night And , ah the blessing !</stage>
     <stage>The music falls and all seem yielding to sleep . Suddenly there are hoof-beats and sounds at the gates below . HALIL springs up .</stage>

     <speaker>SCENE : The forecourt of the castle , beyond which is the garden and in the distance the mountains , under the deep tropical blue of morning</speaker>
     <p>On the right the wall enclosing the castle grounds run back and is lost in the foliage of cypress , palm , orange ; it is pierced by an arched gate with lifted portcullis . On the left rises the dark front of the castle , its arabesqued doorway open . Across the rear a low arcaded screen of masonry , with an entrance to the right , separates the court from the garden . Before it a fountain , guarded by a statue of a Knight of St. John , falls into a porphyry basin , By the castle door , to the front , and elsewhere , are stone seats . HASSAN is standing moodily by the screen , left , looking out the portcullis . He starts , hearing steps , and as the old leach TREMITUS enters , motions him silently into the castle ; then muttering “ the old blood-letter , ” stands as before , while CIVA , MAGA , and MAURIA are heard m the garden , and enter gaily bearing water-jars to the fountain . CIVA sees his look and breaks into a twitting laughter . The other two join her .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Renier</speaker>
     <p>A pang !— For days<stage>Takes her hand .</stage>Before I found Yolanda on the breast Of Camarin of Paphos —— I suffered in the furnace of suspicion The fume and suffocation of the thought That you were the guilty one — you my own wife .<stage>She recoils to YOLANDA , who comes up .</stage>I did ; but rue , rue it !... ... Yet — it is just That you recoil even as now you do From stain upon your wedded constancy .... But Time that is e'erhYpppHeNpitiful may pass Soon over it — And leave only forgiveness . And perhaps Then I shall win you as I never have .— Now the request .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Berengere</speaker>
     <p>That now ... I cannot plead .<stage>Sees YOLANDA harden . Is impelled .</stage>And yet I must ... It is that , till I bid Amaury may not know of this ... not know This trouble fallen from a night or evil — Pitiless on us as a meteor 's ash .</p>

     <lg>
      <l>How !</l>
      <l>And to this wanton 's perfidy to bind</l>
      <l>Him witless to her — with a charm perhaps —</l>
      <l>Or , past releasing , with a philtre ? She</l>
      <l>Whom now he holds pure as a spirit sped</l>
      <l>From immortality , or the fair fields</l>
      <l>Of the sun , to be his bride ?</l>

      <l>Sir , no !... She means</l>
      <l>Not I shall wed him !</l>
      <stage>Winningly .</stage>
      <l>Only that you spare</l>
      <l>To separate us with this horror ; that</l>
      <l>You trust me to dispel his love , to pall</l>
      <l>And chill his passion from me . For I crave</l>
      <l>Only one thing — innocence in his sight .</l>
      <l>Believe !— believe !</l>

    </sp>
    <sp>

      <l>And may have destiny you cannot know .</l>
      <l>But you will heed ?</l>
      <l>For somewhere in you there is tenderness .</l>
      <l>Once when you chafed in fever and I bore</l>
      <l>White orange blossoms dewy to your pillow</l>
      <l>You touched my hand gently , as might a father .</l>
      <stage>Caresses his .</stage>
      <l>Once on the tower when alone at dusk</l>
      <l>I sang — I know not why — of lost delights ,</l>
      <l>Of vanished roses that are ere recalling</l>
      <l>May to the world , you came and suddenly</l>
      <l>Lifted my brow up silent to your kiss .</l>
      <l>Ah , you remember ; you will hear me ?</l>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Renier</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>No !</l>
      <l>Though you are cunning .— Thus you wove the mesh</l>
      <l>About Amaury — till he could not move</l>
      <l>Beyond you .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Yolanda</speaker>
     <p>For his sake I ask it .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Renier</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>For</l>
      <l>No sake but to o'ersway him with your eyes</l>
      <l>In secret , thus , and with</l>

      <l>Brought with you out of Heaven .</l>

      <l>So deem you and , my Berengere , I grieve ,</l>

     <speaker>Berengere</speaker>
     <p>It grieves you not .</p>

     <p>Then not ! and half I fear — you here ?— it should not . There 's midnight in this thing and mystery . Does she not love — Camarin ? Yolanda<stage>trembling</stage>Say no more . Be all — all as you will .</p>

      <l>To-morrow then , unless Amaury runs</l>

In the left distance , also , a portion of Famagouste is visible above the waves — its orient walls and towers , white domes and houses , interspersed with tall palms . The interior of the Hall is the same ; only the divan is placed to the front and left , the lectern near the balcony leading to the sleeping apartments and to the chapel . SMARDA is lying lithely on the divan , beguiled with her charms and amulets , and from time to time giving a low , sinuous laugh . VITTIA enters , watches a moment , thoughtful , then advances .</p>

Forward are two other pillars whose bases form seats . The right wall has , set midway , a large door hung with heavy curtains . In the rear are smaller doors leading to a sacristy . The altar lamp and a few tapers burn . ALESSA enters , rubbing her eyes as if to clear them of vision , looks around , then calls uncertainly —</p>

     <p>For you !— and her who sleeps forgiven there ,<stage>With deep abandon .</stage>Now while her spirit weightless overwingeth Night , to that Throne whose seeing heals all shame ! For her I did ! but oh , for you , whose least Murmur to me is infinite with Spring , Whose smile is light , filling the air with dawn , Whose touch , wafture of immortality Unto my weariness ; and whose eyes , now , Are as the beams God lifted first , they tell us , Over the uncreated , In the far singing mother-dawn of the world !— Come with me then , but tearless , to her side .<stage>They go to the bier and stand as in a dream . A pause ; then her lips move , last , as if inspired .</stage>While there is sin to sway the soul and sink it Pity should be as strong as love or death !<stage>With a cry of joy he enfolds her , and they kneel , wrapped about with the clear moon .</stage>THE END . LYRICS JAEL Jehovah ! Jehovah ! art Thou not stronger than gods of the heathen ? I slew him , that Sisera , prince of the host Thou dost hate . But fear of his blood is upon me , about me is breathen His spirit — by night and by day come voices that wait . Athirst and affrightened he fled from the star-wrought waters of Kishon . His face was as wool when he swooned at the door of my tent . The Lord hath given him into the hand of perdition , I smiled — but he saw not the face of my cunning intent . He thirsted for water : I fed him the curdless milk of the cattle . He lay in the tent under purple and crimson of Tyre . He slept and he dreamt of the surge and storming of battle . Ah ha ! but he woke not to waken Jehovah 's ire . He slept as he were a chosen of Israel 's God Almighty . A dog out of Canaan !— thought he I was woman alone ? I slipt like an asp to his ear and laughed for the sight he Would give when the carrion kites should tear to his bone . I smote thro ’ his temple the nail , to the dust a worm did I bind him . My heart was a-leap with rage and a-quiver with scorn . And I danced with a holy delight before and behind him — I that am called blessed o'er all who 're of Judah born . “ Aye , come , I will show thee , O Barak , a woman is more than a warrior , ” I cried as I lifted the door wherein Sisera lay . “ To me did he fly and I shall be called his destroyer — I , Jael , who am subtle to find for the Lord a way ! ” “ Above all the daughters of men be blest — of Gilead or Asshur , ” Sang Deborah , prophetess , under her waving palm . “ Behold her , ye people , behold her the heathen 's abasher ; Behold her the Lord hath uplifted — behold and be calm . “ The mother of him at the window looks out thro ’ the lattice to listen — Why roll not the wheels of his chariot ? why does he stay ? Shall he not return with the booty of battle , and glisten In songs of his triumph — ye women , why do ye not say ? ” And I was as she who danced when the Seas were rendered asunder And stood , until Egypt pressed in to be drowned unto death . My breasts were as fire with the glory , the rocks that were under My feet grew quick with the gloating that beat in my breath . At night I stole out where they cast him , a sop to the jackal and raven . But his bones stood up in the moon and I shook with affright . The strength shrank out of my limbs and I fell a craven Before him — the nail in his temple gleamed bloodily bright . Jehovah ! Jehovah ! art Thou not stronger than gods of the heathen ? I slew him , that Sisera , prince of the host Thou dost hate . But fear of his blood is upon me , about me is breathen His spirit — by day and by night come voices that wait . I fly to the desert , I fly to the mountain — but they will not hide me . His gods haunt the winds and the caves with vengeance that cries For judgment upon me ; the stars in their courses deride me — The stars Thou hast hung with a breath in the wandering skies . Jehovah ! Jehovah ! I slew him the scourge and sting of Thy Nation . Take from me his spirit , take from me the voice of his blood . With madness I rave — by day and by night , defamation ! Jehovah , release me ! Jehovah ! if still Thou art God ! MARY AT NAZARETH I know , Lord , Thou hast sent Him — Thou art so good to me !— But Thou hast only lent Him , His heart 's for Thee ! I dared — Thy poor hand-maiden — Not ask a prophet-child : Only a boy-babe laden For earth — and mild . But this one Thou hast given Seems not for earth — or me ! His lips flame truth from heaven , And vanity Seem all my thoughts and prayers When He but speaks Thy Law ; Out of my heart the tares Are torn by awe ! I cannot look upon Him So strangely burn His eyes — Hath not some grieving drawn Him From Paradise ? For Thee , for Thee I 'd live , Lord ! Yet oft I almost fall Before Him — Oh , forgive , Lord , My sinful thrall ! But e'en when He was nursing , A baby at my breast , It seemed He was dispersing The world 's unrest . Thou bad'st me call Him “ Jesus ” And from our heavy sin I know He shall release us , From Sheol win . But , Lord , forgive ! the yearning That He may sometimes be Like other children , learning Beside my knee , Or playing , prattling , seeking For help ,— comes to my heart .... Ah sinful , Lord , I 'm speaking — How good Thou art ! OUTCAST I did not fear , But crept close up to Christ and said , “ Is He not here ? ” They drew me back — The seraphs who had never bled Of weary lack — But still I cried , With torn robe , clutching at His feet , “ Dear Christ ! He died So long ago ! Is He not here ? Three days , unfleet As mortal flow Of time I 've sought — Till Heaven 's amaranthine ways Seem as sere nought ! ” A grieving stole Up from His heart and waned the gaze Of His clear soul Into my eyes . “ He is not here , ” troubled He sighed . “ For none who dies Beliefless may Bend lips to this sin-healing Tide , And live alway . ” Then darkness rose Within me , and drear bitterness . Out of its throes I moaned , at last , “ Let me go hence ! Take off the dress , The charms Thou hast Around me strown ! Beliefless too am I without His love — and lone ! ” Unto the Gate They led me , tho ’ with pitying doubt . I did not wait But stepped across Its portal , turned not once to heed Or know my loss . Then my dream broke , And with it every loveless creed — Beneath love 's stroke . ADELIL Proud Adelil ! Proud Adelil ! Why does she lie so cold ?<stage>I made her shrink , I made her reel , I made her white lids fold .</stage>We sat at banquet , many maids , She like a Valkyr free .<stage>I hated the glitter of her braids , I hated her blue eye 's glee !</stage>In emerald cups was poured the mead ; Icily blew the night .<stage>But tears unshed and woes that bleed Brew bitterness and spite .</stage>“ A goblet to my love ! ” she cried , “ Prince where the sea-winds fly ! ”<stage>Her love !— it was for that he died , And for it she should die .</stage>She lifted the cup and drank — she saw A heart within its lees .<stage>I laughed like the dead who feel the thaw Of summer in the breeze .</stage>They looked upon her stricken still , And sudden they grew appalled .<stage>“ It is thy lover 's heart ! ” I shrill As the sea-crow to her called .</stage>Palely she took it — did it give Ease there against her breast ?<stage>Dead — dead she swooned , but I cannot live , And dead I shall not rest .</stage>THE DYING POET Swing in thy splendour , O silent sun , Drawing my heart with thee over the west ! Done is its day as thy day is done , Fallen its quest ! Swoon into purple and rose — then sink , Tho ’ to arise again out of the dawn . Sink while I praise thee , ere thro ’ the dark link Of death I am drawn ! Sunk ? art thou sunken ? how great was life ! I like a child could cry for it again — Cry for its beauty , pang , fleeting and strife , Its women , its men ! For , how I drained it with love and delight ! Opened its heart with the magic of grief ! Reaped every season — its day and its night ! Loved every sheaf ! Aye , not a meadow my step has trod , Never a flower swung sweet to my face , Never a heart that was touched of God , But taught me its grace . Off , from my lids then a moment yet , Fingering Death , for again I must see Miraged by memory all that I met Under Time 's lee . There !... I 'm a child again — fair , so fair ! Under the eyes does a marvel not burn ? Speak they not vision , song , frenzy to dare , That still in me yearn ?... Youth ! my wild youth !— O , blood of my heart , Still you can answer with whirling the thought ! Still like the mountain-born rapid can dart , Joyous , distraught !... Love , and her face again ! there by the wood !— Come thou invisible Dark with thy mask ! Shall I not learn if she lives ? and could I more of thee ask ?... Turn me away from the ashen west , Where love 's sad planet unveils to the dusk . Something is stealing like light from my breast — Soul from its husk ... Soft !... Where the dead feel the buried dead , Where the high hermit-bell hourly tolls , Bury me , near to the haunting tread Of life that o'errolls . ON THE MOOR 1 I met a child upon the moor A-wading down the heather ; She put her hand into my own , We crossed the fields together . I led her to her father 's door — A cottage mid the clover . I left her — and the world grew poor To me , a childless rover . 2 I met a maid upon the moor , The morrow was her wedding . Love lit her eyes with lovelier hues Than the eve-star was shedding . She looked a sweet goodbye to me , And o'er the stile went singing . Down all the lonely night I heard But bridal bells a-ringing . 3 I met a mother on the moor , By a new grave a-praying . The happy swallows in the blue Upon the winds were playing . “ Would I were in his grave , ” I said , “ And he beside her standing ! ” There was no heart to break if death For me had made demanding . HUMAN LOVE We spoke of God and Fate , And of that Life — which some await — Beyond the grave . “ It will be fair , ” she said , “ But love is here ! I only crave thy breast Not God 's when I am dead . For He nor wants nor needs My little love . But it may be , if I love thee And those whose sorrow daily bleeds , He knows — and somehow heeds ! ” OH , GO NOT OUT Oh , go not out upon the storm , Go not , my sweet , to Swalchie pool ! A witch tho ’ she be dead may charm Thee and befool . A wild night ‘ tis ! her lover 's moan , Down under ooze and salty weed , She 'll make thee hear — and then her own ! Till thou shall heed . And it will suck upon thy heart — The sorcery within her cry — Till madness out of thee upstart , And rage to die . For him she loved , she laughed to death ! And as afloat his chill hand lay , “ Ha , ha ! to hell I sent his wraith ! ” Did she not say ? And from his finger strive to draw The ring that bound him to her spell ?— But on her closed his hand — she saw ... Oh , who can tell ? For tho ’ she strove — tho ’ she did wail , The dead hand held her cold and fast : The tide crawled in o'er rock and swale , To her at last ! Down in the pool where she was swept He holds her — Oh , go not a-near ! For none has heard her cry but wept And died that year . CALL TO YOUR MATE , BOB-WHITE O call to your mate , bob-white , bob-white , And I will call to mine . Call to her by the meadow-gate , And I will call by the pine . Tell her the sun is hid , bob-white , The windy wheat sways west . Whistle again , call clear and run To lure her out of her nest . For when to the copse she comes , shy bird , With Mary down the lane I 'll walk , in the dusk of locust tops , And be her lover again . Ay , we will forget our hearts are old , And that our hair is gray . We 'll kiss as we kissed at pale sunset One summer 's halcyon day . That day , can it fade ?... ah , bob , bob-white , Still calling — calling still ? We 're coming — a-coming , bent and weighed , But glad with the old love 's thrill ! TRANSCENDED I who was learned in death 's lore Oft held her to my heart And spoke of days when we should love no more — In the long dust , apart . “ Immortal ? ” No — it could not be , Spirit with flesh must die . Tho ’ heart should pray and hope make endless plea , Reason would still outcry .</p>

     <speaker>She died</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>They wrapped her in the dust —</l>
      <l>I heard the dull clod 's dole ,</l>
      <l>And then I knew she lived — that death 's dark lust</l>
      <l>Could never touch her soul !</l>
      <l>THE CRY OF EVE</l>
      <l>Down the palm-way from Eden in the moist</l>
      <l>Midnight lay Eve by her outdriven mate ,</l>
      <l>Pillowed on lilies that still told the sweet</l>
      <l>Of birth within the Garden 's ecstasy .</l>
      <l>Pitiful round her face that could not lose</l>
      <l>Its memory of God 's perfecting was strewn</l>
      <l>Her troubled hair , and sigh grieved after sigh</l>
      <l>Along her loveliness in the white moon .</l>
      <l>Sudden her dream , too cruelly impent</l>
      <l>With pain , broke and a cry fled shuddering</l>
      <l>Into the wounded stillness from her lips .</l>
      <l>Then , cold , she fearfully felt for his hand ,</l>
      <l>While tears , that had before ne'er visited</l>
      <l>Her lids with anguish , stinging traced her cheeks .</l>
      <l>“ Oh , Adam ! ” then as a wild shadow burst</l>
      <l>Her moan on the pale air , “ What have I dreamed ?</l>
      <l>Now do I understand His words , so dim</l>
      <l>To creatures that had quivered but with bliss !</l>
      <l>Since at the dusk thy kiss to me , and I</l>
      <l>Wept at caresses that were once all joy ,</l>
      <l>I have slept , seeing through Futurity</l>
      <l>The uncreated ages visibly !</l>
      <l>Foresuffering phantoms crowded in the womb</l>
      <l>Of Time , and all with lamentable mien</l>
      <l>Accusing thee and me !</l>
      <l>And some were far</l>
      <l>From birth , without a name , but others near —</l>
      <l>Sodom and dark Gomorrah ... from whose flames</l>
      <l>Fleeing one turned ... how like her look to mine</l>
      <l>When the tree 's horror trembled on my taste !</l>
      <l>And Nineveh , a city sinking slow</l>
      <l>Under a shroud of sandy centuries</l>
      <l>That hid me not from the buried cursing eyes</l>
      <l>Of women who gave birth ! And Babylon ,</l>
      <l>Upbuilded on our sin but for a day !</l>
      <l>Ah , to be mother of all misery !</l>
      <l>To be first-called out of the earth and fail</l>
      <l>For a whole world ! To shame maternity</l>
      <l>For women evermore — women whose tears</l>
      <l>Flooding the night , no hope can wipe away !</l>
      <l>To see the wings of Death , as , Adam , thou</l>
      <l>Hast not , endlessly beating , and to hear</l>
      <l>The swooning ages suffer up to God !</l>
      <l>And O that birth-cry of a guiltless child !</l>
      <l>In it are sounding of our sin and woe ,</l>
      <l>With prophesy of ill beyond all years !</l>
      <l>Yearning for beauty never to be seen —</l>
      <l>Beatitude redeemless evermore !</l>
      <l>And I whose dream mourned with all motherhood</l>
      <l>Must hear it soon ! Already do soft skill ,</l>
      <l>Low-babbled lulls , enticings and quick tones</l>
      <l>Of tenderness — that will like light awake</l>
      <l>The folded memory children shall bring</l>
      <l>Out of the dark — move in me longingly .</l>
      <l>Yet thou , Adam , dear fallen thought of God ,</l>
      <l>Thou , when thou too shall hear humanity</l>
      <l>Cry in thy child , wilt groaning wish the world</l>
      <l>Back in unsummoned Void ! and , woe ! wilt fill</l>
      <l>God 's ear with troubled wonder and unrest ! ”</l>
      <l>Softly he soothed her straying hair , and kissed</l>
      <l>The fever from her lips . Over the palms</l>
      <l>The sad moon poured her peace into their eyes ,</l>
      <l>Till Sleep , the angel of forgetfulness ,</l>
      <l>Folded again her wings above their rest .</l>
      <l>THE CHILD GOD GAVE</l>
      <l>“ Give me a little child</l>
      <l>To draw this dreary want out of my breast , ”</l>
      <l>I cried to God .</l>
      <l>“ Give , for my days beat wild</l>
      <l>With loneliness that will not rest</l>
      <l>But under the still sod ! ”</l>
      <l>It came — with groping lips</l>
      <l>And little fingers stealing aimlessly</l>
      <l>About my heart .</l>
      <l>I was like one who slips</l>
      <l>A-sudden into Ecstasy</l>
      <l>And thinks ne'er to depart .</l>
      <l>“ Soon he will smile , ” I said ,</l>
      <l>“ And babble baby love into my ears —</l>
      <l>How it will thrill ! ”</l>
      <l>I waited — Oh , the dread ,</l>
      <l>The clutching agony , the fears !—</l>
      <l>He was so strange and still .</l>
      <l>Did I curse God and rave</l>
      <l>When they came shrinkingly to tell me ‘ twas</l>
      <l>A witless child ?</l>
      <l>No ... I ... I only gave</l>
      <l>One cry ... just one ... I think ... because ...</l>
      <l>You know ... he never smiled .</l>
      <l>MOTHER-LOVE</l>
      <l>The seraphs would sing to her</l>
      <l>And from the River</l>
      <l>Dip her cool grails of radiant Life .</l>
      <l>The angels would bring to her ,</l>
      <l>Sadly a-quiver ,</l>
      <l>Laurels she never had won in earth-strife .</l>
      <l>And often they 'd fly with her</l>
      <l>O'er the star-spaces —</l>
      <l>Silent by worlds where mortals are pent .</l>
      <l>Yea , even would sigh with her ,</l>
      <l>Sigh with wan faces !</l>
      <l>When she sat weeping of strange discontent .</l>
      <l>But one said , “ Why weepest thou</l>
      <l>Here in God 's heaven —</l>
      <l>Is it not fairer than soul can see ? ”</l>
      <l>“ ‘ Tis fair , ah !— -  but keepest thou</l>
      <l>Not me depriven</l>
      <l>Of some one — somewhere — who needeth most me ?</l>
      <l>For tho ’ the day never fades</l>
      <l>Over these meadows ,</l>
      <l>Tho ’ He has robed me and crowned — yet , yet !</l>
      <l>Some love-fear for ever shades</l>
      <l>All with sere shadows —</l>
      <l>Had I no child there — whom I forget ? ”</l>
      <l>ASHORE</l>
      <l>What are the heaths and hills to me ?</l>
      <l>I 'm a-longing for the sea !</l>
      <l>What are the flowers that dapple the dell ,</l>
      <l>And the ripple of swallow-wings over the dusk ;</l>
      <l>What are the church and the folk who tell</l>
      <l>Their hearts to God ?— my heart is a husk !</l>
      <stage>I 'm a-longing for the sea !</stage>
      <l>Aye ! for there is no peace to me —</l>
      <l>But on the peaceless sea !</l>
      <l>Never a child was glad at my knee ,</l>
      <l>And the soul of a woman has never been mine .</l>
      <l>What can a woman 's kisses be ?—</l>
      <l>I fear to think how her arms would twine ,</l>
      <stage>I 'm a-longing for the sea !</stage>
      <l>So , not a home and ease for me —</l>
      <l>But still the homeless sea !</l>
      <l>Where I may swing my sorrow to sleep</l>
      <l>In a hammock hung o'er the voice of the waves ,</l>
      <l>Where I may wake when the tempests heap</l>
      <l>And hurl their hate — and a brave ship saves .</l>
      <stage>I 'm a-longing for the sea !</stage>
      <l>Then when I die , a grave for me —</l>
      <l>But in the graveless sea !</l>
      <l>Where is no stone for an eye to spell</l>
      <l>Thro ’ the lichen a name , a date and a verse .</l>
      <l>Let me be laid in the deeps that swell</l>
      <l>And sigh and wander — an ocean hearse !</l>
      <stage>I 'm a-longing for the sea !</stage>
      <l>LOVE 'S WAY TO CHILDHOOD</l>
      <l>We are not lovers , you and I ,</l>
      <l>Upon this sunny lane ,</l>
      <l>But children who have never known</l>
      <l>Love 's joy or pain .</l>
      <l>The flowers we pass , the summer brook ,</l>
      <l>The bird that o'er us darts —</l>
      <l>We do not know ‘ tis they that thrill</l>
      <l>Our childish hearts .</l>
      <l>The earth-things have no name for us ,</l>
      <l>The ploughing means no more</l>
      <l>Than that they like to walk the fields</l>
      <l>Who plough them o'er .</l>
      <l>The road , the wood , the heaven , the hills</l>
      <l>Are not a World to-day —</l>
      <l>But just a place God 's made for us</l>
      <l>In which to play .</l>
      <l>LISSETTE</l>
      <l>Oh ... there was love in her heart — no doubt of it —</l>
      <l>Under the anger .</l>
      <l>But see what came out of it !</l>
      <l>Not a knave , he !— A Romeo rhyme-smatterer ,</l>
      <l>Cloaking in languor</l>
      <l>And heartache to flatter her .</l>
      <l>And just as a woman will — even the best of them —</l>
      <l>She yielded — brittle .</l>
      <l>God spare me the rest of them !</l>
      <l>Aye ! though ‘ twas but kisses — she swore !— he had of her .</l>
      <l>For , was it little ?</l>
      <l>She thought ‘ twas not bad of her ,</l>
      <l>Said I would lavish a burning hour full</l>
      <l>On any grissette .</l>
      <l>A parry !— and powerful !</l>
      <l>But — “ You are mine , and blood is inflammable ,</l>
      <l>Flaunty Lissette ! ”</l>
      <l>My rage was undammable ....</l>
      <l>Could a stilletto 's one prick be prettier ?</l>
      <l>Look at the gaping .</l>
      <l>No ?— then you 're her pitier !</l>
      <l>Pah ! she 's the better , and I ... I 'm your prisoner .</l>
      <l>Loose me the strapping —</l>
      <l>I 'll lay one more kiss on her .</l>
      <l>TEARLESS</l>
      <l>Do women weep when men have died ?</l>
      <l>It cannot be !</l>
      <l>For I have sat here by his side ,</l>
      <l>Breathing dear names against his face ,</l>
      <l>That he must list to were his place</l>
      <l>Over God 's throne —</l>
      <l>Yet have I wept no tear and made no moan .</l>
      <l>No ! but to lids , that gaze stone-wide ,</l>
      <l>Grief seems in vain .</l>
      <l>Do women weep ?— I was his bride —</l>
      <l>They brought him to me cold and pale —</l>
      <l>Upon his lids I saw the trail</l>
      <l>Of deathly pain .</l>
      <l>They said , “ Her tears will fall like Autumn rain . ”</l>
      <l>I cannot weep ! Not if hot tears ,</l>
      <l>Dropped on his lips ,</l>
      <l>Might burn him back to life and years</l>
      <l>Of yearning love , would any rise</l>
      <l>To flood the anguish from my eyes —</l>
      <l>And I 'm his bride !</l>
      <l>Ah me , do women weep when men have died ?</l>
      <l>THE LIGHTHOUSEMAN</l>

      <l>Burn the clouds with opal fires ;</l>
      <l>When the stars forget to glisten ,</l>
      <l>And the winds refuse to listen</l>
      <l>To the song of my desires ,</l>
      <l>Oh , my love , unto thee !</l>
      <l>When the livid breakers angered</l>
      <l>Churn against my stormy tower ;</l>
      <l>When the petrel flying faster</l>
      <l>Brings an omen to the master</l>
      <l>Of his vessel 's fated hour —</l>
      <l>Oh , the reefs ! ah , the sea !</l>
      <l>Then I climb the climbing stairway ,</l>
      <l>Turn the light across the storm ;</l>
      <l>You are watching , fisher-maiden ,</l>
      <l>For the token flashes laden</l>
      <l>With a love death could not harm —</l>
      <l>Lo , they come , swift and free !</l>
      <l>One — that means , “ I think of thee ! ”</l>
      <l>Two — “ I swear me thine ! ”</l>
      <l>Three — Ah , hear me tho ’ you sleep !—</l>
      <l>Is , “ Love , I know thee mine ! ”</l>
      <l>Thro ’ the darkness , One , Two , Three ,</l>
      <l>All the night they sweep :</l>
      <l>Thro ’ raging darkness o'er the deep ,</l>
      <l>One — and Two — and Three .</l>
      <l>BY THE INDUS</l>
      <l>Thou art late , O Moon ,</l>
      <l>Late ,</l>
      <l>I have waited thee long .</l>
      <l>The nightingale 's flown to her nest ,</l>
      <l>Sated with song .</l>
      <l>The champak hath no odour more</l>
      <l>To pour on the wind as he passeth o'er —</l>
      <l>But my heart it will not rest .</l>
      <l>Thou art late , O Love ,</l>
      <l>Late ,</l>
      <l>For the moon is a-wane .</l>
      <l>The kusa-grass sighs with my sighs ,</l>
      <l>Burns with my pain .</l>
      <l>The lotus leans her head on the stream —</l>
      <l>Shall I not lean to thy breast and dream ,</l>
      <l>Dream ere the night-cool dies ?</l>
      <l>Thou art late , O Death ,</l>
      <l>Late ,</l>
      <l>For he did not come !</l>
      <l>A pariah is my heart ,</l>
      <l>Cast from him — dumb !</l>
      <l>I cannot cry in the jungle 's deep —</l>
      <l>Is it not time for Nirvana 's sleep ?</l>
      <l>O Death , strike with thy dart !</l>
      <l>FROM ONE BLIND</l>
      <l>I cannot say thy cheek is like the rose ,</l>
      <l>Thy hair ripple of sunbeams , and thine eyes</l>
      <l>Violets , April-rich and sprung of God .</l>
      <l>My barren gaze can never know what throes</l>
      <l>Such boons of beauty waken , tho ’ I rise</l>
      <l>Each day a-tremble with the ruthless hope</l>
      <l>That light will pierce my useless lids — then grope</l>
      <l>Till night , blind as the worm within his clod .</l>
      <l>Yet unto me thou are not less divine ,</l>
      <l>I touch thy cheek — and know the mystery hid</l>
      <l>Within the twilight breeze ; I smoothe thy hair</l>
      <l>And understand how slipping hours may twine</l>
      <l>Themselves into eternity : yea , rid</l>
      <l>Of all but love , I kiss thine eyes and seem</l>
      <l>To see all beauty God Himself may dream .</l>
      <l>Why then should I o'ermuch for earth-sight care ?</l>
      <l>AT THE FALL OF ROME</l>
      <l>A. D. 455</l>
      <l>Drink to Death , drink !</l>
      <l>He 's god o ’ the world .</l>
      <l>Up with the cup —</l>
      <l>Let no man shiver !</l>
      <l>Up with the cup —</l>
      <l>Let no man shrink !</l>
      <l>Drink to death ,</l>
      <l>He 's lord o ’ the breath</l>
      <l>Of mortals hurled from the world</l>
      <l>Into Oblivion 's river !</l>
      <l>Drink to Death , aye !</l>
      <l>And then — to the dust !</l>
      <l>Fill with a will —</l>
      <l>And quaff like a lover !</l>
      <l>Fill with a will —</l>
      <l>Who dares a Nay !</l>
      <l>Drink to Death !...</l>
      <l>He lies who saith</l>
      <l>That life is just — ‘ tis a crust</l>
      <l>Tossed to a slave in his hover !</l>
      <l>Drink to Death !— So !</l>
      <l>Who recks for the rest ?</l>
      <l>Love is above —</l>
      <l>Or Hate , what matter ?</l>
      <l>Love is above —</l>
      <l>Or Hell below .</l>
      <l>Drink to Death ,</l>
      <l>For vile is the peth</l>
      <l>Of Rome , and Shame is her name !</l>
      <l>Then drink , and the goblet shatter !</l>
      <l>PEACELESS LOVE</l>
      <l>I say unto all hearts that cannot rest</l>
      <l>For want of love , for beating loud and lonely ,</l>
      <l>Pray the great Mercy-God to give you only</l>
      <l>Love that is passionless within the breast .</l>
      <l>Pray that it may not be a haunting fire ,</l>
      <l>A vision that shall steal insatiably</l>
      <l>All beauteous content , all sweet desire ,</l>
      <l>From faith and dream , star , flower , and song , and sea .</l>
      <l>But seek that soul and soul may meet together ,</l>
      <l>Knowing they have for ever been but one —</l>
      <l>Meet and be surest when ill 's chartless weather</l>
      <l>Drives blinding gales of doubt across their sun .</l>
      <l>Pray — pray ! lest love uptorn shall seem as nether</l>
      <l>Hell-hate and rage beyond oblivion .</l>
      <l>SUNDERED</l>
      <l>God who can bind the stars eternally</l>
      <l>With but a breath of spirit speech , a thought ;</l>
      <l>Who can within earth 's arms lay the mad sea</l>
      <l>Unserverably , and count it as sheer nought —</l>
      <l>With His All-might can bind not you and me .</l>
      <l>For though he pressed us heart to burning heart ,</l>
      <l>Knowing this fatal spell that so enthralls ,</l>
      <l>Still would our souls , unhelpably apart ,</l>
      <l>Stand aliens — beating fierce against the walls</l>
      <l>Of dark unsympathies that ‘ tween us start .</l>
      <l>Stands aliens , aye , and would ! tho ’ we should meet</l>
      <l>Beyond the oblivion of unnumbered births —</l>
      <l>Upon some world where Time cannot repeat</l>
      <l>The feeblest syllable that once was earth 's .</l>
      <l>WITH OMAR</l>
      <l>I sat with Omar by the Tavern door</l>
      <l>Musing the mystery of mortals o'er ,</l>
      <l>And soon with answers alternate we strove</l>
      <l>Whether , beyond death , Life hath any shore .</l>
      <l>“ Come , fill the cup , ” said he . “ In the fire of Spring</l>
      <l>Your Winter-garment of Repentance fling .</l>
      <l>The Bird of Time has but a little way</l>
      <l>To flutter — and the Bird is on the Wing . ”</l>
      <l>“ The Bird of Time ? ” I answered . “ Then have I</l>
      <l>No heart for Wine . Must we not cross the Sky</l>
      <l>Unto Eternity upon his wings —</l>
      <l>Or , failing , fall into the Gulf and die ? ”</l>
      <l>“ So some for the Glories of this World ; and some</l>
      <l>Sigh for the Prophet 's Paradise to come ;</l>
      <l>But you , Friend , take the Cash — the Credit leave ,</l>
      <l>Nor heed the rumble of a distant Drum ! ”</l>
      <l>“ What , take the Cash and let the Credit go ?</l>
      <l>Spend all upon the Wine the while I know</l>
      <l>A possible To-morrow may bring thirst</l>
      <l>For Drink but Credit then shall cause to flow ? ”</l>
      <l>“ Yea , make the most of what you yet may spend ,</l>
      <l>Before we too into the Dust descend ;</l>
      <l>Dust unto Dust , and under Dust , to lie ,</l>
      <l>Sans Wine , sans Song , sans Singer , and — sans End ! ”</l>
      <l>“ Into the Dust we shall descend — we must .</l>
      <l>But can the soul not break the crumbling Crust</l>
      <l>In which he is encaged ? To hope or to</l>
      <l>Despair he will — which is more wise or just ? ”</l>
      <l>“ The worldly hope men set their hearts upon</l>
      <l>Turns Ashes — or it prospers : and anon ,</l>
      <l>Like Snow upon the Desert 's dusty Face ,</l>
      <l>Lighting a little hour or two — is gone . ”</l>
      <l>“ Like Snow it comes — to cool one burning Day ;</l>
      <l>And like it goes — for all our plea or sway .</l>
      <l>But flooding tears nor Wine can ever purge</l>
      <l>The Vision it has brought to us away . ”</l>
      <l>“ But to this world we come and Why not knowing</l>
      <l>Nor Whence , like water willy-nilly flowing ;</l>
      <l>And out of it , as Wind along the waste ,</l>
      <l>We know not Whither , willy-nilly blowing . ”</l>
      <l>“ True , little do we know of Why or Whence .</l>
      <l>But is forsooth our Darkness evidence</l>
      <l>There is no Light ?— the worm may see no star</l>
      <l>Tho ’ heaven with myriad multitudes be dense . ”</l>
      <l>“ But , all unasked , we 're hither hurried Whence ?</l>
      <l>And , all unasked , we 're Whither hurried hence ?</l>
      <l>O , many a cup of this forbidden Wine</l>
      <l>Must drown the memory of that insolence . ”</l>
      <l>“ Yet can not — ever ! For it is forbid</l>
      <l>Still by that quenchless soul within us hid ,</l>
      <l>Which cries , ‘ Feed — feed me not on Wine alone ,</l>
      <l>For to Immortal Banquets I am bid . ’ ”</l>
      <l>“ Well oft I think that never blows so red</l>
      <l>The Rose as where some buried Caesar bled :</l>
      <l>That every Hyacinth the Garden wears</l>
      <l>Dropt in her lap from some once lovely Head . ”</l>
      <l>“ Then if , from the dull Clay thro ’ with Life 's throes ,</l>
      <l>More beautiful spring Hyacinth and Rose ,</l>
      <l>Will the great Gard'ner for the uprooted soul</l>
      <l>Find Use no sweeter than — useless Repose ? ”</l>
      <l>“ We cannot know — so fill the cup that clears</l>
      <l>To-day of past regret and future fears :</l>
      <l>To-morrow !— Why , To-morrow we may be</l>
      <l>Ourselves with yesterday 's sev'n thousand Years . ”</l>
      <l>“ No Cup there is to bring oblivion</l>
      <l>More during than Regret and Fear — no , none !</l>
      <l>For Wine that 's Wine to-day may change and be</l>
      <l>Marah before to-morrow 's Sands have run . ”</l>
      <l>“ Myself when young did eagerly frequent</l>
      <l>Doctor and Saint , and heard great argument</l>
      <l>About it and about : but evermore</l>
      <l>Came out by the same door wherein I went . ”</l>
      <l>“ The doors of Argument may lead Nowhither ,</l>
      <l>Reason become a Prison where may wither</l>
      <l>From sunless eyes the Infinite , from hearts</l>
      <l>All Hope , when their sojourn too long is thither . ”</l>
      <l>“ Up from Earth 's Centre thro ’ the Seventh Gate</l>
      <l>I rose , and on the throne of Saturn sate ,</l>
      <l>And many a Knot unravelled by the Road —</l>
      <l>But not the Master-knot of Human fate . ”</l>
      <l>“ The Master-knot knows but the Master-hand</l>
      <l>That scattered Saturn and his countless Band</l>
      <l>Like seeds upon the unplanted heaven 's Air :</l>
      <l>The Truth we reap from them is Chaff thrice fanned . ”</l>
      <l>“ Yet if the Soul can fling the Dust aside</l>
      <l>And naked on the air of Heaven ride ,</l>
      <l>Wer't not a shame — wer't not a shame for him</l>
      <l>In this clay carcass crippled to abide ? ”</l>
      <l>“ No , for a day bound in this Dust may teach</l>
      <l>More of the Saki 's Mind than we can reach</l>
      <l>Through aeons mounting still from Sky to Sky —</l>
      <l>May open through all Mystery a breach . ”</l>
      <l>“ You speak as if Existence closing your</l>
      <l>Account and mine should know the like no more ;</l>
      <l>The Eternal Saki from that Bowl has poured</l>
      <l>Millions of bubbles like us , and will pour . ”</l>
      <l>“ Bubbles we are , pricked by the point of Death .</l>
      <l>But , in each bubble , hope there dwells a Breath</l>
      <l>That lifts it and at last to Freedom flies ,</l>
      <l>And o'er all heights of Heaven wandereth . ”</l>
      <l>“ A moment 's halt — a momentary taste</l>
      <l>Of Being from the Well amid the Waste —</l>
      <l>And Lo !— the phantom Caravan has reached</l>
      <l>The Nothing it set out from — Oh , make haste ! ”</l>
      <l>“ And yet it should be — it should be that we</l>
      <l>Who drink shall drink of Immortality .</l>
      <l>The Master of the Well has much to spare :</l>
      <l>Will He say , ‘ Taste ’ — then shall we no more be ? ”</l>
      <l>“ The Moving Finger writes ; and having writ ,</l>
      <l>Moves on ; nor all your Piety nor Wit</l>
      <l>Shall lure it back to cancel half a line ,</l>
      <l>Nor all your tears wash out a word of it . ”</l>
      <l>“ And — were it otherwise ?... We might erase</l>
      <l>The Letter of some Sorrow in whose place</l>
      <l>No other sounding , we should fail to spell</l>
      <l>The Heart which yearns behind the mock-world 's face . ”</l>
      <l>“ Well , this I know ; whether the one True Light</l>
      <l>Kindle to Love , or Wrath — consume me quite ,</l>
      <l>One flash of it within the Tavern caught</l>
      <l>Better than in the Temple lost outright . ”</l>
      <l>“ In Temple or in Tavern ‘ t may be lost .</l>
      <l>And everywhere that Love hath any Cost</l>
      <l>It may be found ; the Wrath it seems is but</l>
      <l>A Cloud whose Dew should make its power most . ”</l>
      <l>“ But see His Presence thro ’ Creation 's veins ,</l>
      <l>Running Quicksilver-like eludes your pains ;</l>
      <l>Taking all shapes from Mah to Mahi ; and</l>
      <l>They change and perish all — but He remains . ”</l>
      <l>“ All — it may be . Yet lie to sleep , and lo ,</l>
      <l>The soul seems quenched in Darkness — is it so ?</l>
      <l>Rather believe what seemeth not than seems</l>
      <l>Of Death — until we know — until we know . ”</l>
      <l>“ So wastes the Hour — gone in the vain pursuit</l>
      <l>Of This and That we strive o'er and dispute .</l>
      <l>Better be jocund with the fruitful Grape</l>
      <l>Than sadden after none , or bitter Fruit . ”</l>
      <l>“ Better — unless we hope the Shadow ‘ s thrown</l>
      <l>Across our Path by glories of the Unknown</l>
      <l>Lest we may think we have no more to live</l>
      <l>And bide content with dim-lit Earth alone . ”</l>
      <l>“ Then , strange , is't not ? that of the myriads who</l>
      <l>Before us passed the door of Darkness through</l>
      <l>Not one returns to tell us of the Road ,</l>
      <l>Which to discover we must travel too ? ”</l>
      <l>“ Such is the ban ! but even though we heard</l>
      <l>Love in Life 's All we still should crave the word</l>
      <l>Of one returned . Yet none is sure , we know ,</l>
      <l>Though they lie deep , they are by Death deterred . ”</l>
      <l>“ Send then thy Soul through the Invisible</l>
      <l>Some letter of the After-life to spell :</l>
      <l>And by and by thy Soul returned to thee</l>
      <l>But answers , ‘ I myself am Heaven and Hell . ’ ”</l>
      <l>“ From the Invisible , he does . But sent</l>
      <l>Through Earth where living Goodness though ‘ tis blent</l>
      <l>With Evil dures , may he not read the Voice ,</l>
      <l>‘ To make thee but for Death were toil ill-spent ’ ? ”</l>
      <l>“ Well , when the Angel of the darker drink</l>
      <l>At last shall find us by the river-brink ,</l>
      <l>And offering his Cup invite our souls</l>
      <l>Forth to our lips to quaff , we shall not shrink . ”</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>“ No</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>But if in the sable Cup we knew</l>
      <l>Death without waking were the fateful brew ,</l>
      <l>Nobler it were to curse as Coward Him</l>
      <l>Who roused us into light — then light withdrew . ”</l>
      <l>“ Then thou who didst with pitfall and with gin</l>
      <l>Beset the Road I was to wander in ,</l>
      <l>Thou wilt not with Predestined Evil round</l>
      <l>Enmesh , and then impute my fall to sin . ”</l>
      <l>“ He will not . If one evil we endure</l>
      <l>To ultimate Debasing , oh , be sure</l>
      <l>‘ Tis not of Him predestined , and the sin</l>
      <l>Not His nor ours — but fate 's He could not cure . ”</l>
      <l>“ Yet , ah , that Spring should vanish with the Rose !</l>
      <l>That Youth 's sweet-scented Manuscript should close !</l>
      <l>The Nightingale that on the branches sang —</l>
      <l>Ah , whence , and whither flown again , who knows ? ”</l>
      <l>“ So does it seem — no other joys like these !</l>
      <l>Yet Summer comes , and Autumn 's honoured ease ;</l>
      <l>And wintry Age , is't ever whisperless</l>
      <l>Of that Last Spring , whose Verdure may not cease ? ”</l>
      <l>“ Still , would some winged Angel ere too late</l>
      <l>Arrest the yet unfolded roll of Fate ,</l>
      <l>And make the stern Recorder otherwise</l>
      <l>Enregister or quite obliterate ! ”</l>
      <l>“ To otherwise enregister believe</l>
      <l>He toils eternally , nor asks Reprieve .</l>
      <l>And could Creation perfect from his hands</l>
      <l>Have come at Dawn , none overmuch should grieve . ”</l>
      <l>So till the wan and early scene of day</l>
      <l>We strove , and silent turned at last away ,</l>
      <l>Thinking how men in ages yet unborn</l>
      <l>Would ask and answer — trust and doubt and pray .</l>

      <stage>IN TIME OF WAR</stage>
      <l>The young stork sleeps in the pine-tree tops ,</l>
      <l>Down on the brink of the river .</l>
      <l>My baby sleeps by the bamboo copse —</l>
      <l>The bamboo copse where the rice field stops :</l>
      <l>The bamboos sigh and shiver .</l>
      <l>The white fox creeps from his hole in the hill ;</l>
      <l>I must pray to Inari .</l>
      <l>I hear her calling me low and chill —</l>
      <l>Low and chill when the wind is still</l>
      <l>At night and the skies are starry .</l>
      <l>And ever she says , “ He 's dead ! he 's dead !</l>
      <l>Your lord who went to battle .</l>
      <l>How shall your baby now be fed ,</l>
      <l>Ukibo fed , with rice and bread —</l>
      <l>What if I hush his prattle ? ”</l>
      <l>The red moon rises as I slip back ,</l>
      <l>And the bamboo stems are swaying .</l>
      <l>Inari was deaf — and yet the lack ,</l>
      <l>The fear and lack , are gone , and the rack ,</l>
      <l>I know not why — with praying .</l>
      <l>For though Inari cared not at all ,</l>
      <l>Some other god was kinder .</l>
      <l>I wonder why he has heard my call ,</l>
      <l>My giftless call — and what shall befall ?...</l>

      <l>On you for ages has been spilt —</l>
      <l>Till you are beautiful as Time</l>
      <l>Mossy and mellowing ever makes :</l>
      <l>Wrapped as you are in lull — or rhyme</l>
      <l>Of sounding drum that sudden breaks .</l>
      <l>This is my prayer then , this , that I</l>
      <l>Too may reverence all of life ,</l>
      <l>Beauty , and power and miss no high</l>
      <l>Awe of a world with wonder rife .</l>
      <l>That I may build in spirit fair</l>
      <l>Temples and torii on each place</l>
      <l>That I have loved — O hear it , Air ,</l>
      <l>Ocean and Earth , and grant your grace !</l>
      <l>EVOCATION</l>
      <stage>NIKKO , JAPAN , 1905</stage>
      <l>Weird thro ’ the mist and cryptomeria</l>
      <l>Booms the temple bell ,</l>
      <l>Down from the tomb of Ieyasu</l>
      <l>Yearning , as a knell .</l>
      <l>Down from the tomb where many an aeon</l>
      <l>Silently has knelt ,</l>
      <l>Many a pilgrimage of millions —</l>
      <l>Still about it felt .</l>
      <l>Still , for see them gather ghostly</l>
      <l>Now , as the numb sound</l>
      <l>Floats as unearthly necromancy</l>
      <l>From the past 's dead ground .</l>
      <l>See the invisible vast millions ,</l>
      <l>Hear their soundless feet</l>
      <l>Climbing the shrine-ways to the gilded</l>
      <l>Carven temple 's seat .</l>
      <l>And , one among them — pale among them —</l>
      <l>Passes waning by .</l>
      <l>What is it tells me mystically</l>
      <l>That strange one was I ?...</l>
      <l>Weird thro ’ the mist and cryptomeria</l>
      <l>Dies the bell — ‘ tis dumb .</l>
      <l>After how many lives returning</l>
      <l>Shall I hither come ?</l>
      <l>Hither again ! and climb the votive</l>
      <l>Ever mossy ways ?</l>
      <l>Who shall the gods be then , the millions ,</l>
      <l>Meek , entreat or praise ?</l>
      <l>THE ATONER</l>
      <l>Winter has come in sackcloth and ashes</l>
      <stage>Penance for Summer 's enverdured sheaves</stage>
      <l>Bitterly , cruelly , bleakly he lashes</l>
      <l>His limbs that are naked of grass and leaves .</l>
      <l>He moans in the forest for sins unforgiven</l>
      <stage>Sins of the revelrous days of June</stage>
      <l>—</l>
      <l>Moans while the sun drifts dull from the heaven ,</l>
      <l>Giftless of heat 's beshriving boon .</l>
      <l>Long must he mourn , and long be his scourging ,</l>
      <stage>Long will the day-god aloof frown cold</stage>
      <l>,</l>
      <l>Long will earth listen the rue of his dirging —</l>
      <l>Till the dark beads of his days are told .</l>
      <l>INTIMATION</l>
      <l>All night I smiled as I slept ,</l>
      <l>For I heard the March-wind feel</l>
      <l>Blindly about in the trees without</l>
      <l>For buds to heal .</l>
      <l>All night in dreams , for I smelt ,</l>
      <l>In the rain-wet woods and fields ,</l>
      <l>The coming flowers and the glad green hours</l>
      <l>That summer yields .</l>
      <l>And when at dawn I awoke ,</l>
      <l>At the blue-bird 's wooing cheep ,</l>
      <l>Winter with all its chill and pall</l>
      <l>Seemed but a sleep .</l>
      <l>IN JULY</l>
      <l>This path will tell me where dark daisies dance</l>
      <l>To the white sycamores that dell them in ;</l>
      <l>Where crow and flicker cry melodious din ,</l>
      <l>And blackberries in ebon ripeness glance</l>
      <l>Luscious enticings under briery green .</l>
      <l>It will slip under coppice limbs that lean</l>
      <l>Brushingly as the slow-belled heifer pants</l>
      <l>Toward weedy water-plants</l>
      <l>That shade the pool-sunk creek 's reluctant trance .</l>
      <l>I shall find bell-flower spires beside the gap</l>
      <l>And lady phlox within the hollow 's cool ;</l>
      <l>Cedar with sudden memories of Yule</l>
      <l>Above the tangle tipped with blue skullcap .</l>
      <l>The high hot mullein fond of the full sun</l>
      <l>Will watch and tell the low mint when I 've won</l>
      <l>The hither wheat where idle breezes nap ,</l>
      <l>And fluffy quails entrap</l>
      <l>Me from their brood that crouch to escape mishap .</l>
      <l>Then I shall reach the mossy water-way</l>
      <l>That gullies the dense hill up to its peak ,</l>
      <l>There dally listening to the eerie eke</l>
      <l>Of drops into cool chalices of clay .</l>
      <l>Then on , for elders odorously will steal</l>
      <l>My senses till I climb up where they heal</l>
      <l>The livid heat of its malingering ray ,</l>
      <l>And wooingly betray</l>
      <l>To memory many a long-forgotten day .</l>
      <l>There I shall rest within the woody peace</l>
      <l>Of afternoon . The bending azure frothed</l>
      <l>With silveryness , the sunny pastures swathed ,</l>
      <l>Fragrant with morn-mown clover and seed-fleece ;</l>
      <l>The hills where hung mists muse , and Silence calls</l>
      <l>To Solitude thro ’ aged forest halls ,</l>
      <l>Will waft into me their mysterious ease ,</l>
      <l>And in the wind 's soft cease</l>
      <l>I shall hear hintings of eternities .</l>
      <l>FROM ABOVE</l>
      <l>What do I care if the trees are bare</l>
      <l>And the hills are dark</l>
      <l>And the skies are gray .</l>
      <l>What do I care for chill in the air ,</l>
      <l>For crows that cark</l>
      <l>At the rough wind 's way .</l>
      <l>What do I care for the dead leaves there —</l>
      <l>Or the sullen road</l>
      <l>By the sullen wood .</l>
      <l>There 's heart in my heart</l>
      <l>To bear my load !</l>
      <l>So enough , the day is good !</l>
      <l>SONGS TO A. H. R .</l>
      <l>I .</l>
      <l>THE WORLD 'S , AND MINE</l>
      <l>The world may hear</l>
      <l>The wind at his trees ,</l>
      <l>The lark in her skies ,</l>
      <l>The sea on his leas ;</l>
      <l>May hear the song rise</l>
      <l>From the breast of a woman</l>
      <l>And think it as dear</l>
      <l>As heaven tho ’ human .</l>
      <l>But I have a music they can never know —</l>
      <l>The touch of you , soul of you , heart of you . Oh !</l>
      <l>All else that is said or sung ‘ s but a part of you —</l>
      <l>Ever to me ‘ tis so !</l>
      <l>II .</l>
      <l>LOVE-CALL IN SPRING</l>
      <l>Not only the lark but the robin too</l>
      <stage>Oh , heart o ’ my heart , come into the wood !</stage>
      <l>Is singing the air to gladness new</l>
      <l>As the breaking bud</l>
      <l>And the freshet 's flood !</l>
      <l>Not only the peeping grass and the scent —</l>
      <stage>Oh , love o ’ my life , fly unto me here !</stage>
      <l>Of violets coming ere April 's spent —</l>
      <l>But the frog 's shrill cheer</l>
      <l>And the crow 's wild jeer !</l>
      <l>Not only the blue , not only the breeze ,</l>
      <stage>Oh , soul o ’ my heart , why tarry so long !</stage>
      <l>But sun that is sweeter upon the trees</l>
      <l>Than rills that throng</l>
      <l>To the brooklet 's song !</l>
      <l>Oh , heart o ’ my heart , oh , heart o ’ my love ,</l>
      <stage>Oh soul o ’ my soul , haste unto me , haste !</stage>
      <l>For spring is below and God is above —</l>
      <l>But all is a waste</l>
      <l>Without thee — Haste !</l>
      <l>III .</l>
      <l>MATING</l>
      <l>The bliss of the wind in the redbud ringing !</l>
      <l>What shall we do with the April days !</l>
      <l>Kingcups soon will be up and swinging —</l>
      <l>What shall we do with May 's !</l>
      <l>The cardinal flings , “ They are made for mating ! ”</l>
      <l>Out on the bough he flutters , a flame .</l>
      <l>Thrush-flutes echo “ For mating 's elating !</l>
      <l>Love is its other name ! ”</l>
      <l>They know ! know it ! but better , oh , better ,</l>
      <l>Dearest , than ever a bird in Spring ,</l>
      <l>Know we to make each moment a debtor</l>
      <l>Unto love 's burgeoning !</l>
      <l>IV .</l>
      <l>UNTOLD</l>
      <l>Could I , a poet ,</l>
      <l>Implant the truth of you ,</l>
      <l>Seize it and sow it</l>
      <l>As Spring on the world .</l>
      <l>There were no need</l>
      <l>To fling</l>
      <stage>forsooth</stage>
      <l>of you</l>
      <l>Fancies that only lovers heed !</l>
      <l>No , but unfurled ,</l>
      <l>The bloom , the sweet of you ,</l>
      <stage>As unto me they are opened oft</stage>
      <l>Would with their beauty 's breath repeat of you</l>
      <l>All that my heart breathes loud or soft !</l>
      <l>V .</l>
      <l>LOVE-WATCH</l>
      <l>My love 's a guardian-angel</l>
      <l>Who camps about thy heart ,</l>
      <l>Never to flee thine enemy ,</l>
      <l>Nor from thee turn apart .</l>
      <l>Whatever dark may shroud thee</l>
      <l>And hide thy stars away ,</l>
      <l>With vigil sweet his wings shall beat</l>
      <l>About thee till the day .</l>
      <l>VI .</l>
      <l>AS YOU ARE</l>
      <l>Dark hair — dark eyes —</l>
      <l>But heart of sun ,</l>
      <l>Pity and hope</l>
      <l>That rill and run</l>
      <l>With flowing fleet</l>
      <l>To heal the defeat</l>
      <l>Of all Life has undone .</l>
      <l>Dark hair — dark eyes —</l>
      <l>But soul as clear ,</l>
      <l>Trusty and fair</l>
      <l>As e'er drew near</l>
      <l>To clasp its mate</l>
      <l>And enter the gate</l>
      <l>Of Love that casts out fear .</l>
      <l>Dark hair — dark eyes —</l>
      <l>But , there is seen</l>
      <l>In them the most</l>
      <l>That earth can mean ;</l>
      <l>The most that death</l>
      <l>Can bring — or breath</l>
      <l>There — in the bright Unseen !</l>
      <l>VII .</l>
      <l>AT AMALFI</l>
      <l>Come to the window , you who are mine .</l>
      <l>Waken ! the night is calling .</l>
      <l>Sit by me here — with the moon 's fair shine</l>
      <l>Into your deep eyes falling .</l>
      <l>The sea afar is a fearful gloom ;</l>
      <l>Lean from the casement , listen !</l>
      <l>Anear , it breaks with a faery spume ,</l>
      <l>Spraying the moon-path 's glisten .</l>
      <l>The little white town below lies deep</l>
      <l>As eternity in slumber .</l>
      <l>O , you who are mine , how a glance can reap</l>
      <l>Beauties beyond all number !</l>
      <l>“ Amalfi ! ” say it — as the stars set</l>
      <l>O'er yon far promontory .</l>
      <l>“ Amalfi ! ” ... Shall we ever forget</l>
      <l>Even Above this glory ?</l>
      <l>No ; as twin sails at anchor ride ,</l>
      <l>Our spirits rock together</l>
      <l>On a sea of love — lit as this tide</l>
      <l>With tenderest star-weather !</l>
      <l>And the quick ecstasy within</l>
      <l>Your breast is against me beating .</l>
      <l>Amalfi !... Never a night shall win</l>
      <l>From God again such fleeting .</l>
      <l>Ah — but the dawn is redd'ning up</l>
      <l>Over the moon low-dying .</l>
      <l>Come , come away — we have drunk the cup :</l>
      <l>Ours is the dream undying !</l>
      <l>VIII .</l>
      <l>ON THE PACIFIC</l>
      <l>A storm broods far on the foam of the deep ;</l>
      <l>The moon-path gleams before .</l>
      <l>A day and a night , a night and a day ,</l>
      <l>And the way , love , will be o'er .</l>
      <l>Six thousand wandering miles we have come</l>
      <l>And never a sail have seen .</l>
      <l>The sky above and the sea below</l>
      <l>And the drifting clouds between .</l>
      <l>Yet in our hearts unheaving hope</l>
      <l>And light and joy have slept .</l>
      <l>Nor ever lonely has seemed the wave</l>
      <l>Tho ’ heaving wild it leapt .</l>
      <l>For there is talismanic might</l>
      <l>Within our vows of love</l>
      <l>To breathe us over all seas of life —</l>
      <l>On to that Port above</l>
      <l>Where the great Captain of all ships</l>
      <l>Shall anchor them or send</l>
      <l>Them forth on a vaster Voyage , yea ,</l>
      <l>On one that shall not end .</l>
      <l>And upon that we two , I think ,</l>
      <l>Together still shall sail .</l>
      <l>O may it be , my own , or may</l>
      <l>We perish in death 's gale !</l>
      <l>THE WINDS</l>
      <l>The East Wind is a Bedouin ,</l>
      <l>And Nimbus is his steed ;</l>
      <l>Out of the dusk with the lightning 's thin</l>
      <l>Blue scimitar he flies afar ,</l>
      <l>Whither his rovings lead .</l>
      <l>The Dead Sea waves</l>
      <l>And Egypt caves</l>
      <l>Of mummied silence laugh</l>
      <l>When he mounts to quench the Siroc 's stench ,</l>
      <l>And to wrench</l>
      <l>From his clutch the tyrant 's staff .</l>
      <l>The West Wind is an Indian brave</l>
      <l>Who scours the Autumn 's crest .</l>
      <l>Dashing the forest down as a slave</l>
      <l>He tears the leaves from its limbs and weaves</l>
      <l>A maelstrom for his breast .</l>
      <l>Out of the night</l>
      <l>Crying to fright</l>
      <l>The earth he swoops to spoil —</l>
      <l>There is furious scathe in the whirl of his wrath ,</l>
      <l>In his path</l>
      <l>There is misery and moil .</l>
      <l>The North Wind is a Viking — cold</l>
      <l>And cruel , armed with death !</l>
      <l>Born in the doomful deep of the old</l>
      <l>Ice Sea that froze ere Ymir rose</l>
      <l>From Niflheim 's ebon breath .</l>
      <l>And with him sail</l>
      <l>Snow , Frost , and Hail ,</l>
      <l>Thanes mighty as their lord ,</l>
      <l>To plunder the shores of Summer 's stores —</l>
      <l>And his roar 's</l>
      <l>Like the sound of Chaos ’ horde .</l>
      <l>The South Wind is a Troubadour ;</l>
      <l>The Spring , his serenade .</l>
      <l>Over the mountain , over the moor ,</l>
      <l>He blows to bloom from the winter 's tomb</l>
      <l>Blossom and leaf and blade .</l>
      <l>He ripples the throat</l>
      <l>Of the lark with a note</l>
      <l>Of lilting love and bliss ,</l>
      <l>And the sun and the moon , the night and the noon ,</l>
      <l>Are a-swoon —</l>
      <l>When he woos them with his kiss .</l>
      <l>THE DAY-MOON</l>
      <l>So wan , so unavailing ,</l>
      <l>Across the vacant day-blue dimly trailing !</l>
      <l>Last night , sphered in thy shining ,</l>
      <l>A Circe — mystic destinies divining ;</l>
      <l>To-day but as a feather</l>
      <l>Torn from a seraph 's wing in sinful weather ,</l>
      <l>Down-drifting from the portals</l>
      <l>Of Paradise , unto the land of mortals .</l>
      <l>Yet do I feel thee awing</l>
      <l>My heart with mystery , as thy updrawing</l>
      <l>Moves thro ’ the tides of Ocean</l>
      <l>And leaves lorn beaches barren of its motion ;</l>
      <l>Or strands upon near shallows</l>
      <l>The wreck whose weirded form at night unhallows</l>
      <l>The fisher maiden 's prayers —</l>
      <l>“ For him !— that storms may take not unawares ! ”</l>
      <l>So wan , so unavailing ,</l>
      <l>Across the vacant day-blue dimly trailing !</l>
      <l>But Night shall come atoning</l>
      <l>Thy phantom life thro ’ day , and high enthroning</l>
      <l>Thee in her chambers arrassed</l>
      <l>With star-hieroglyphs , leave thee unharassed</l>
      <l>To glide with silvery passion ,</l>
      <l>Till in earth 's shadow swept thy glowings ashen .</l>
      <l>TO A SINGING WARBLER</l>
      <l>“ Beauty ! all — all — is beauty ? ”</l>
      <l>Was ever a bird so wrong !</l>
      <l>“ No young in the nest , no mate , no duty ? ”</l>
      <l>Ribald ! is this your song ?</l>
      <l>“ Glad it is ended , ” are you ?</l>
      <l>The Spring and its nuptial fear ?</l>
      <l>“ Freedom is better than love ? ” beware you</l>
      <l>There will be May next year !</l>
      <l>“ Beauty ! ” again ? still “ beauty ” ?</l>
      <l>Wait till the winter comes !</l>
      <l>Till kestrel and hungry kite seek booty</l>
      <l>And there are so few crumbs !</l>
      <l>Wait ? nay , fling it unbidden ,</l>
      <l>The false little song you prate !</l>
      <l>Too sweet are its fancies to be chidden ,</l>
      <l>E'en of the rudest fate !</l>
      <l>TO THE SEA</l>
      <l>Art thou enraged , O sea , with the blue peace</l>
      <l>Of heaven , so to uplift thine armed waves ,</l>
      <l>Thy billowing rebellion ‘ gainst its ease ,</l>
      <l>And with Tartarean mutter from cold caves ,</l>
      <l>From shuddering profundities where shapes</l>
      <l>Of awe glide through entangled leagues of ooze ,</l>
      <l>To hoot thy watery omens evermore ,</l>
      <l>And evermore thy moanings interfuse</l>
      <l>With seething necromancy and mad lore ?</l>
      <l>Or , dost thou labour with the drifting bones</l>
      <l>Of countless dead , thou mighty Alchemist ,</l>
      <l>Within whose stormy crucible the stones</l>
      <l>Of sunk primordial shores , granite and schist ,</l>
      <l>Are crumbled by thine all-abrasive beat ?</l>
      <l>With immemorial chanting to the moon ,</l>
      <l>And cosmic incantation dost thou crave</l>
      <l>Rest to be found not till thy wild be strewn</l>
      <l>Frigid and desert over earth 's last grave ?</l>
      <l>Thou seemest with immensity mad , blind —</l>
      <l>With raving deaf , with wandering forlorn ;</l>
      <l>Parent of Demogorgon whose dire mind</l>
      <l>Is night and earthquake , shapeless shame and scorn</l>
      <l>Of the o'ermounting birth of Harmony .</l>
      <l>Bound in thy briny bed and gnawing earth</l>
      <l>With foamy writhing and fierce-panted tides ,</l>
      <l>Thou art as Fate in torment of a dearth</l>
      <l>Of black disaster and destruction 's strides .</l>
      <l>And how thou dost drive silence from the world ,</l>
      <l>Incarnate Motion of all mystery !</l>
      <l>Whose waves are fury-wings , whose winds are hurled</l>
      <l>Whither thy Ghost tempestuous can see</l>
      <l>A desolate apocalypse of death .</l>
      <l>Oh , how thou dost drive silence from the world ,</l>
      <l>With emerald overflowing , waste on waste</l>
      <l>Of flashing susurration , dashed and swirled</l>
      <l>‘ Gainst isles and continents and airs o'erspaced !</l>
      <l>Nay , frustrate Hope art thou of the Unknown ,</l>
      <l>Gathered from primal mist and firmament ;</l>
      <l>A surging shape of Life 's unfathomed moan ,</l>
      <l>Whelming humanity with fears unmeant .</l>
      <l>Yet do I love thee , O , above all fear ,</l>
      <l>And loving thee unconquerably trust</l>
      <l>The runes that from thy ageless surfing start</l>
      <l>Would read , were they revealed , gust upon gust ,</l>
      <l>That Immortality is might of heart !</l>
      <l>THE DEAD GODS</l>
      <l>I thought I plunged into that dire Abyss</l>
      <l>Which is Oblivion , the house of Death .</l>
      <l>I thought there blew upon my soul the breath</l>
      <l>Of time that was but never more can be .</l>
      <l>Ten thousand years I thought I lay within</l>
      <l>Its Void , blind , deaf , and motionless , until —</l>
      <l>Though with no eye nor ear — I felt the thrill</l>
      <l>Of seeing , heard its phantoms move and sigh .</l>
      <l>First one beside me spoke , in tones that told</l>
      <l>He once had been a god ,— “ Persephone ,</l>
      <l>Tear from thy brow its withered crown , for we</l>
      <l>Are king and queen of Tartarus no more ;</l>
      <l>And that wan , shrivelled sceptre in thy hand ,</l>
      <l>Why dost thou clasp it still ? Cast it away ,</l>
      <l>For now it hath no virtue that can sway</l>
      <l>Dull shades or drive the Furies to their spoil .</l>
      <l>Cast it away , and give thy palm to mine :</l>
      <l>Perchance some unobliterated spark</l>
      <l>Of memory shall warm this dismal Dark .</l>
      <l>Perchance — vain ! vain ! love could not light such gloom . ”</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>He sank</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Then in great ruin by him moved</l>
      <l>Another as in travail of some thought</l>
      <l>Near unto birth ; and soon from lips distraught</l>
      <l>By aged silence , fell , with hollow woe :</l>
      <l>“ Ah , Pluto , dost thou , one time lord of Styx</l>
      <l>And Acheron make moan of night and cold ?</l>
      <l>Were we upon Olympus as of old</l>
      <l>Laughter of thee would rock its festal height .</l>
      <l>But think , think thee of me , to whom or gloom</l>
      <l>Or cold were more unknown than impotence !</l>
      <l>See the unhurled thunderbolt brought hence</l>
      <l>To mock me when I dream I still am Jove ! ”</l>
      <l>Too much it was : I withered in the breath ;</l>
      <l>And lay again ten thousand lifeless years ;</l>
      <l>And then my soul shook , woke — and saw three biers</l>
      <l>Chiselled of solid night majestically .</l>
      <l>The forms outlaid upon them were unwound</l>
      <l>As with the silence of eternity .</l>
      <l>Numbing repose dwelt o'er them like a sea ,</l>
      <l>That long hath lost tide , wave and roar , in death .</l>
      <l>“ Ptah , Ammon , and Osiris are their names , ”</l>
      <l>A spirit hieroglyphed unto my soul ,</l>
      <l>“ Ptah , Ammon , and Osiris — they who stole</l>
      <l>The heart of Egypt from the God of gods :</l>
      <l>“ Aye , they ! and these ; ” pointing to many wraiths</l>
      <l>That stood around — Baal , Ormuzd , Indra , all</l>
      <l>Whom frightened ignorance and sin 's appall</l>
      <l>Had given birth , close-huddled in despair .</l>
      <l>Their eyes were fixed upon a cloven slope</l>
      <l>Down whose descent still other forms a-fresh</l>
      <l>From earth were drawn , by the unceasing mesh</l>
      <l>Of Time to their irrevocable end .</l>
      <l>“ They are the gods , ” one said — “ the gods whom men</l>
      <l>Still taunt with wails for help . ” — Then a deep light</l>
      <l>Upbore me from the Gulf , and thro ’ its might</l>
      <l>I heard the worlds cry , “ God alone is God ! ”</l>
      <l>AT WINTER 'S END</l>
      <l>The weedy fallows winter-worn ,</l>
      <l>Where cattle shiver under sodden hay .</l>
      <l>The plough-lands long and lorn —</l>
      <l>The fading day .</l>
      <l>The sullen shudder of the brook ,</l>
      <l>And winds that wring the writhen trees in vain</l>
      <l>For drearier sound or look —</l>
      <l>The lonely rain .</l>
      <l>The crows that train o'er desert skies</l>
      <l>In endless caravans that have no goal</l>
      <l>But flight — where darkness flies —</l>
      <l>From Pole to Pole .</l>
      <l>The sombre zone of hills around</l>
      <l>That shrink in misty mournfulness from sight ,</l>
      <l>With sunset aureoles crowned —</l>
      <l>Before the night .</l>
      <l>APRIL</l>
      <l>A laughter of wind and a leaping of cloud ,</l>
      <l>And April , oh , out under the blue !</l>
      <l>The brook is awake and the blackbird loud</l>
      <l>In the dew !</l>
      <l>But how does the robin high in the beech ,</l>
      <l>Beside the wood with its shake and toss ,</l>
      <l>Know it — the frenzy of bluets to reach</l>
      <l>Thro ’ the moss !</l>
      <l>And where did the lark ever learn his speech ?</l>
      <l>Up wildly sweet he 's over the mead !</l>
      <l>Is more than the rapture of earth can teach</l>
      <l>In its creed ?</l>
      <l>I never shall know — I never shall care !</l>
      <l>‘ Tis , oh , enough to live and to love !</l>
      <l>To laugh and warble and dream and dare</l>
      <l>Are to prove !</l>
      <l>AUGUST GUESTS</l>
      <l>The wind slipt over the hill</l>
      <l>And down the valley .</l>
      <l>He dimpled the cheek of the rill</l>
      <l>With a cooling kiss .</l>
      <l>Then hid on the bank a-glee</l>
      <l>And began to rally</l>
      <l>The rushes — Oh ,</l>
      <l>I love the wind for this !</l>
      <l>A cloud blew out of the west</l>
      <l>And spilt his shower</l>
      <l>Upon the lily-bud crest</l>
      <l>And the clematis .</l>
      <l>Then over the virgin corn</l>
      <l>Besprinkled a dower</l>
      <l>Of dew-gems — And ,</l>
      <l>I love the cloud for this !</l>
      <l>AUTUMN</l>
      <l>I know her not by fallen leaves</l>
      <l>Or resting heaps of hay ;</l>
      <l>Or by the sheathing mists of mauve</l>
      <l>That soothe the fiery day .</l>
      <l>I know her not by plumping nuts ,</l>
      <l>By redded hips and haws ,</l>
      <l>Or by the silence hanging sad</l>
      <l>Under the wind 's sere pause .</l>
      <l>But by her sighs I know her well —</l>
      <l>They are like Sorrow 's breath ;</l>
      <l>And by this longing , strangely still ,</l>
      <l>For something after death .</l>
      <l>THE WORLD</l>
      <l>Vox desperans .</l>
      <l>The World is a wind — on which are blown</l>
      <l>All mysteries that are .</l>
      <l>Out of a Void it sprang — and to</l>
      <l>A Void shall spring , afar .</l>
      <l>Vox sperans .</l>
      <l>The World is Visible God — who is</l>
      <l>Its Soul invisible .</l>
      <l>There is no Void beyond that He</l>
      <l>Abiding fills not full .</l>
      <l>TO THE DOVE</l>
      <l>1</l>
      <l>Thy mellow passioning amid the leaves</l>
      <l>Trembles around me in the summer dusk</l>
      <l>That falls along the oatlands ’ sallow sheaves</l>
      <l>And haunts above the runnel 's voice a-husk</l>
      <l>With plashy willow and bold-wading reed .</l>
      <l>The solitude 's dim spell it breaketh not ,</l>
      <l>But softer mourns unto me from the mead</l>
      <l>Than airs within the dead primrose 's heart ,</l>
      <l>Or breath of silences in dells begot</l>
      <l>To soothe some grief-wan maid with love a-mort .</l>
      <l>2</l>
      <l>On many sylvan eves of childhood thou</l>
      <l>Didst woo my homeward path with tenderness ,</l>
      <l>Woo till the awing owlet ceased to cow</l>
      <l>With his chill screech of quavering distress .</l>
      <l>At phantom midnight wakened I have heard</l>
      <l>Thy mated dreams from the wind-eerie elm ,</l>
      <l>And as a potion medicined and myrrhed ,</l>
      <l>As an enchantment 's runic utterance ,</l>
      <l>It would draw sleep back to her lulling realm</l>
      <l>Over my lids till day should disentrance .</l>
      <l>3</l>
      <l>A priestess art thou of Simplicity ,</l>
      <l>Who hath one fane — the heaven above thy nest ;</l>
      <l>One incense — love ; one stealing litany</l>
      <l>Of peace from rivered vale and upland crest .</l>
      <l>Yea , thou art Hers , who makes prayer of the breeze ,</l>
      <l>Hope of the cool upwelling from sweet soils ,</l>
      <l>Faith of the dark'ning distance , charities</l>
      <l>Of vesper scents , and of the glow-worm 's throb</l>
      <l>Joy whose first leaping rends the care-wound coils</l>
      <l>That would earth of its heavenliness rob .</l>
      <l>4</l>
      <l>But few , how few her worshippers ! For we</l>
      <l>Cast at a myriad shrines our souls , to rise</l>
      <l>Beliefless , unanointed , bound not free ,</l>
      <l>To sacrificing a vain sacrifice !</l>
      <l>Let thy lone innocence then quickly null</l>
      <l>Within our veins doubt-led and wrong desire</l>
      <l>Or drugging knowledge that but fills o'erfull</l>
      <l>Of feverous mystery the days we drain !</l>
      <l>Be thy warm notes like an Orphean lyre</l>
      <l>To lead us to life 's Arcady again !</l>
      <l>AT TINTERN ABBEY</l>
      <stage>JUNE , 1903</stage>
      <l>O Tintern , Tintern ! evermore my dreams</l>
      <l>Troubled of thy grave beauty shall be born ;</l>
      <l>Thy crumbling loveliness and ivy streams</l>
      <l>Shall speak to me for ever , from this morn ;</l>
      <l>The wind-wild daws about thy arches drifting ,</l>
      <l>Clouds sweeping o'er thy ruin to the sea ,</l>
      <l>Gray Tintern , all the hills about thee , lifting</l>
      <l>Their misty waving woodland verdancy !</l>
      <l>The centuries that draw thee to the earth</l>
      <l>In envy of thy desolated charm ,</l>
      <l>The summers and the winters , the sky 's girth</l>
      <l>Of sunny blue or bleakness , seek thy harm .</l>
      <l>But would that I were Time , then only tender</l>
      <l>Touch upon thee should fall as on I sped ;</l>
      <l>Of every pillar would I be defender ,</l>
      <l>Of every mossy window — of thy dead !</l>
      <l>Thy dead beneath obliterated stones</l>
      <l>Upon the sod that is at last thy floor ,</l>
      <l>Who list the Wye not as it lonely moans</l>
      <l>Nor heed thy Gothic shadows grieving o'er .</l>
      <l>O Tintern , Tintern ! trysting-place , where never</l>
      <l>Is wanting mysteries that move the breast ,</l>
      <l>I 'll hear thy beauty calling , ah , for ever —</l>
      <l>Till sinks within me the last voice to rest !</l>
      <l>THE VICTORY</l>
      <l>See , see !— the blows at his breast ,</l>
      <l>Abyss at his back ,</l>
      <l>The peril of dark that pressed ,</l>
      <l>The doubts in a pack ,</l>
      <l>That hunted to drag him down</l>
      <l>Have triumphed ? and now</l>
      <l>He sinks who climbed for the crown</l>
      <l>To the Summit 's brow ?</l>
      <l>No !— though at the foot he lies ,</l>
      <l>Fallen and vain ,</l>
      <l>With gaze to the peak whose skies ,</l>
      <l>He could not attain ,</l>
      <l>The victory is , with strength —</l>
      <l>No matter the past !—</l>
      <l>He 'd dare it again , the dark length ,</l>
      <l>And the fall at last !</l>
      <l>SEARCHING DEATH 'S DARK</l>
      <l>When Autumn 's melancholy robes the land</l>
      <l>With silence and sad fadings mystical</l>
      <l>Of other years move thro ’ the mellow fields ,</l>
      <l>I turn unto this meadow of the dead</l>
      <l>Strewn with the leaves stormed from October trees ,</l>
      <l>And wonder if my resting shall be dug</l>
      <l>Here by this cedar 's moan or under the sway</l>
      <l>Of yonder cypress — lair of winds that rove</l>
      <l>As Valkyries from Valhalla 's court</l>
      <l>In search of worthy slain .</l>
      <l>And sundry times with questioning I tease</l>
      <l>The entombed of their estate — seeking to know</l>
      <l>Whether ‘ tis sweeter in the grave to feel</l>
      <l>The oblivion of Nature 's flow , or here</l>
      <l>Wander as gleam and shadow flit her face .</l>
      <l>Whether the harvesting of pain and joy</l>
      <l>Ends with the ivied slab , or whether death</l>
      <l>Pours the warm chrism of Immortality</l>
      <l>Into each human heart whose glow is spent .</l>
      <l>Nor do my askings fall on the chill voids</l>
      <l>Of unavailing silence . For a voice</l>
      <l>Of sighing wind may answer , or it leaps ,</l>
      <l>Though wordless , from a marble seraph 's face .</l>
      <l>Or sometimes from unspeakable deeps of gold</l>
      <l>That ebb along the west revealings wing</l>
      <l>And tremor , like etherial swift tongues</l>
      <l>Unskilled of human speech , about my heart —</l>
      <l>Till , youth , age , death ... even earth 's all , it seems ,</l>
      <l>Are but wild moments wakened in that Soul ,</l>
      <l>To whom infinities are as a span ,</l>
      <l>Eternities as bird-flights o'er the sun ,</l>
      <l>And worlds as sands blown from Sahara 's wilds</l>
      <l>Into the sea ....</l>
      <l>Then twilight bells ring back</l>
      <l>My wandered spirit from the wilderness</l>
      <l>Of Mystery , whence none may find a path</l>
      <l>To the Unknown , and like one who upborne</l>
      <l>Has steered the unmeasured summer skies until</l>
      <l>Their calm seems God , I turn transfigured home .</l>
      <l>SERENITY</l>
      <l>And could I love it more — this simple scene</l>
      <l>Of cot-strewn hills and fields long-harvested ,</l>
      <l>That lie as if forgotten were all green ,</l>
      <l>So bare , so dead ?</l>
      <l>Or could my gaze more tenderly entwine</l>
      <l>Each pallid beech or silvery sycamore ,</l>
      <l>Outreaching arms in patience to divine</l>
      <l>If winter 's o'er ?</l>
      <l>Ah no , the wind has blown into my veins</l>
      <l>The blue infinity of sky , the sense</l>
      <l>Of meadows free to-day from icy pains —</l>
      <l>From wintry vents .</l>
      <l>And sunny peace more virgin than the glow</l>
      <l>Falling from eve 's first star into the night ,</l>
      <l>Brings hope believing what it ne'er can know</l>
      <l>With mortal sight .</l>
      <l>TO THE SPRING WIND</l>
      <l>Ah , what a changeling !</l>
      <l>Yester you dashed from the west ,</l>
      <l>Altho ’ it is Spring ,</l>
      <l>And scattered the hail with maniac zest</l>
      <l>Thro ’ the shivering corn — in scorn</l>
      <l>For the labour of God and man .</l>
      <l>And now from the plentiful South you haste ,</l>
      <l>With lovingest fingers ,</l>
      <l>To ruefully lift and wooingly fan</l>
      <l>The lily that lingers a-faint on the stalk :</l>
      <l>As if the chill waste</l>
      <l>Of the earth 's May-dreams ,</l>
      <l>The flowers so full of her joy ,</l>
      <l>Were not — as it seems —</l>
      <l>A wanton attempt to destroy .</l>
      <l>THE RAMBLE</l>
      <l>Down the road</l>
      <l>Which asters tangle ,</l>
      <l>Thro ’ the gap</l>
      <l>Where green-briar twines ,</l>
      <l>By the path</l>
      <l>Where dry leaves dangle</l>
      <l>Down from the ivy vines ,</l>
      <l>We go —</l>
      <l>By sedgy fallows</l>
      <l>And along</l>
      <l>The stifled brook ,</l>
      <l>Till it stops</l>
      <l>In lushy mallows</l>
      <l>Just at the bridge 's crook .</l>
      <l>Then , again ,</l>
      <l>O'er fence , thro ’ thicket ,</l>
      <l>To the mouth</l>
      <l>Of the rough ravine —</l>
      <l>Where the weird</l>
      <l>Leaf-hidden cricket</l>
      <l>Chirrs thro ’ the weirder green —</l>
      <l>There 's a way</l>
      <l>O'er rocks — but quicker</l>
      <l>Is the best</l>
      <l>Of heart and foot ,</l>
      <l>As the beams</l>
      <l>Above us flicker</l>
      <l>Sun upon moss and root !</l>
      <l>And we leap —</l>
      <l>As wildness tingles</l>
      <l>From the air</l>
      <l>Into our blood —</l>
      <l>With a cry</l>
      <l>Thro ’ golden dingles</l>
      <l>Hid in the heart of the wood .</l>
      <l>Oh , the wood</l>
      <l>With winds a-wrestle !</l>
      <l>With the nut</l>
      <l>And acorn strown !</l>
      <l>Oh , the wood</l>
      <l>Where creepers trestle ,</l>
      <l>Tree unto tree o'ergrown !</l>
      <l>With a climb</l>
      <l>The ledging summit</l>
      <l>Of the hill</l>
      <l>Is reached in glee .</l>
      <l>For an hour</l>
      <l>We gaze off from it</l>
      <l>Into the sky 's blue sea .</l>
      <l>But a bell</l>
      <l>And sunset 's crimson</l>
      <l>Soon recall</l>
      <l>The homeward path .</l>
      <l>And we turn</l>
      <l>As the glory dims on</l>
      <l>The hay-fields ’ mounded math .</l>
      <l>Thro ’ the soft</l>
      <l>And silent twilight</l>
      <l>We come ,</l>
      <l>To the stile at last ,</l>
      <l>As the clear</l>
      <l>Undying eyelight</l>
      <l>Of the stars tells day is past .</l>
      <l>RETURN</l>
      <l>Ah , it was here — September</l>
      <l>And silence filled the air —</l>
      <l>I came last year to remember ,</l>
      <l>And muse , hid away from care .</l>
      <l>It was here I came — the thistle</l>
      <l>Was trusting her seed to the wind ;</l>
      <l>The quail in the croft gave whistle</l>
      <l>As now — and the fields lay thinned .</l>
      <l>I know how the hay was steeping ,</l>
      <l>Brown mows under mellow haze ;</l>
      <l>How a frail cloud-flock was creeping</l>
      <l>As now over lone sky-ways .</l>
      <l>Just there where the cat-bird 's calling</l>
      <l>Her mock-hurt note by the shed ,</l>
      <l>The use-worn wain was stalling</l>
      <l>In the weedy brook 's dry bed .</l>
      <l>And the cricket , lone little chimer</l>
      <l>Of day-long dreams in the vines ,</l>
      <l>Chirred on like a doting rhymer</l>
      <l>O'erhYpppHeNvain of his firstling lines .</l>
      <l>He 's near me now by the aster ,</l>
      <l>Beneath whose shadowy spray</l>
      <l>A sultry bee seeps faster</l>
      <l>As the sun slips down the day .</l>
      <l>And there are the tall primroses</l>
      <l>Like maidens waiting to dance .</l>
      <l>They stood in the same shy poses</l>
      <l>Last year , as if to entrance</l>
      <l>The stately mulleins to waken</l>
      <l>From death and lead them around :</l>
      <l>And still they will stand untaken ,</l>
      <l>Till drops their gold to the ground .</l>
      <l>Yes , it was here — September</l>
      <l>And silence round me yearned .</l>
      <l>Again I 've come to remember ,</l>
      <l>Again for musing returned</l>
      <l>To the searing fields assuaging ,</l>
      <l>And the falling leaves ’ sad balm :</l>
      <l>Away from the world 's keen waging —</l>
      <l>To harvest and hills and calm .</l>
      <l>THE EMPTY CROSS</l>
      <l>The eve of Golgotha had come ,</l>
      <l>And Christ lay shrouded in the garden 's tomb :</l>
      <l>Among the olives , Oh , how dumb ,</l>
      <l>How sad the sun incarnadined the gloom !</l>
      <l>The hill grew dim — the pleading cross</l>
      <l>Reached empty arms toward the closing gate .</l>
      <l>Jerusalem , oh , count thy loss !</l>
      <l>Oh , hear ye ! hear ye ! ere it be too late !</l>
      <l>Reached bleeding arms — but how in vain !</l>
      <l>The murmurous multitude within the wall</l>
      <l>Already had forgot His pain —</l>
      <l>To-morrow would forget the cross — and all !</l>
      <l>They knew not Rome before its sign ,</l>
      <l>Bending her brow bound with the nations ’ threne ,</l>
      <l>Would sweep all lands from Nile to Rhine</l>
      <l>In servitude unto the Nazarene .</l>
      <l>Nor knew that millions would forsake</l>
      <l>Ancestral shrines great with the glow of time ,</l>
      <l>And lifting up its token shake</l>
      <l>Aeons with thrill of love or battle 's crime .</l>
      <l>With empty arms aloft it stood :</l>
      <l>Ah , Scribe and Pharisee , ye builded well !</l>
      <l>The cross emblotted with His blood</l>
      <l>Mounts , highest Hope of men against earth 's hell !</l>
      <l>SUNSET-LOVERS</l>
      <l>Upon how many a hill ,</l>
      <l>Across how many a field ,</l>
      <l>Beside how many a river 's whispery flowing ,</l>
      <l>They stand , with eyes a-thrill ,</l>
      <l>And hearts of day-rue healed ,</l>
      <l>Gazing , O wistful sun , upon thy going !</l>
      <l>They have forgotten life ,</l>
      <l>Forgotten sunless death ;</l>
      <l>Desire is gone — is it not gone for ever ?</l>
      <l>No memory of strife</l>
      <l>Have they , or pain-sick breath ,</l>
      <l>No hopes to fear or fears hope cannot sever .</l>
      <l>Silent the gold steals down</l>
      <l>The west , and mystery</l>
      <l>Moves deeper in their hearts and settles darker .</l>
      <l>‘ Tis faded — the day 's crown ;</l>
      <l>But strange and shadowy</l>
      <l>They see the Unseen as night falls stark and starker .</l>
      <l>Like priests whose altar fires</l>
      <l>Are spent , immovable</l>
      <l>They stand , in awful ecstasy uplifted .</l>
      <l>Zephyrs awake tree-lyres ,</l>
      <l>The starry deeps are full ,</l>
      <l>Earth with a mystic majesty is gifted .</l>
      <l>Ah , sunset-lovers , though</l>
      <l>Time were but pulsing pain ,</l>
      <l>And death no more than its eternal ceasing ,</l>
      <l>Would you not choose the throe ,</l>
      <l>Hold the oblivion vain ,</l>
      <l>To have beheld so many days releasing ?</l>
      <l>TO A ROSE</l>
      <stage>IN A HOSPITAL</stage>
      <l>Why do I love thee ?—</l>
      <l>Not because thy wak'ning lips</l>
      <l>Were wooed to bloom by minstrel wind</l>
      <l>Of Araby or Ind .</l>
      <l>Not because thy fragrance slips</l>
      <l>Into my soul — as if thou must</l>
      <l>Be sprung of a mother 's dust .</l>
      <l>Not because she gave her breast</l>
      <l>To thee for one long night — she whose</l>
      <l>Pure heart I ne'er shall lose .</l>
      <l>But when I lay in sick unrest</l>
      <l>Afar from those who are my own ,</l>
      <l>Thou camest from hands unknown :</l>
      <l>Therefore I love thee !</l>
      <l>UNBURTHENED</l>
      <l>Not pain nor the sunny wine</l>
      <l>Of gladness steepeth my still spirit as</l>
      <l>I lift my gaze across the winter meads</l>
      <l>Engarmented in stubble robes of brown .</l>
      <l>For , as those solitary trees afar</l>
      <l>Have reached unbudding boughs</l>
      <l>To the dim warmth of the February sun ,</l>
      <l>And melted on the infinite calm of space ,</l>
      <l>So I have reached — and am no more distraught</l>
      <l>With the quivering pangs of memory 's yesterday .</l>
      <l>But the boon of blue skies deeper than despair ,</l>
      <l>Of rests that rise</l>
      <l>As tides of sleep ,</l>
      <l>And care borne on the plumes</l>
      <l>Of swan-swift clouds away to the sullen shades</l>
      <l>Of quelled snow-storms low-lying in the west ,</l>
      <l>Have lulled my soul with soft infinitude .</l>
      <l>And now ... down sinks the sun ,</l>
      <l>Until , half-arched above the marge of earth ,</l>
      <l>It hangs , a golden door ,</l>
      <l>Through which effulgent Paradise beyond</l>
      <l>Burns seeming forth along the path of those</l>
      <l>Who , crowned by Death with Life , pass to its portal .</l>
      <l>How soon ‘ tis closed — how soon ! The trumpetings</l>
      <l>Of seraphs whose gold blasts of light break o'er</l>
      <l>Purplescent passing battlements of cloud ,</l>
      <l>Sound clear ... then comes the dusk !</l>
      <l>WHERE PEACE IS DUTY</l>
      <l>Dimming in sunniness , aerily distant ,</l>
      <l>Valley and hillside float ;</l>
      <l>Up to me wavering , softly insistent ,</l>
      <l>Wanders the wood-brook 's note .</l>
      <l>Anchored beyond in azure unending</l>
      <l>Cloud-sails await wind-tide .</l>
      <l>Oh , for the skylands where soon they 'll be wending —</l>
      <l>And , unabiding , bide .</l>
      <l>Where Time aflow thro ’ infinite spaces</l>
      <l>Stays for no throttle of pain !</l>
      <l>Where the stars go at eve to their places ;</l>
      <l>Where silence never shall wane !</l>
      <l>Where there 's no sense but of beauty 's wild sweetness ,</l>
      <l>Thought but of sweetening beauty !</l>
      <l>Where wanting 's stilled in unwanting 's completeness —</l>
      <l>Where peace is duty !</l>
      <l>WANTON JUNE</l>
      <l>I knew she would come !</l>
      <l>Sarcastic November</l>
      <l>Laughed cold and glum</l>
      <l>On the last red ember</l>
      <l>Of forest leaves .</l>
      <l>He was laughing , the scorner ,</l>
      <l>At me forlorner</l>
      <l>Than any that grieves —</l>
      <l>Because I asked him if June would come !</l>
      <l>But I knew she would come !</l>
      <l>When snow-hearted winter</l>
      <l>Gripped river and loam ,</l>
      <l>And the wind sped flinter</l>
      <l>On icy heel ,</l>
      <l>I was chafing my sorrow</l>
      <l>And yearning to borrow</l>
      <l>A hope that would steal</l>
      <l>Across the hours — till June should come .</l>
      <l>And now she is here .—</l>
      <l>The wanton !— I follow</l>
      <l>Her steps , ever near ,</l>
      <l>To the shade of the hollow</l>
      <l>Where violets blow :</l>
      <l>And chide her for leaving ,</l>
      <l>Tho ’ half , still , believing</l>
      <l>She taunted me so ,</l>
      <l>To make her abided return more dear .</l>
      <l>AUTUMN AT THE BRIDGE</l>
      <l>Brown dropping of leaves ,</l>
      <l>Soft rush of the wind ,</l>
      <l>Slow searing of sheaves</l>
      <l>On the hill ;</l>
      <l>Green plunging of frogs ,</l>
      <l>Cool lisp of the brook ,</l>
      <l>Far barking of dogs</l>
      <l>At the mill ;</l>
      <l>Hot hanging of clouds ,</l>
      <l>High poise of the hawk ,</l>
      <l>Flush laughter of crowds</l>
      <l>From the Ridge ;</l>
      <l>Nut-falling , quail-calling ,</l>
      <l>Wheel-rumbling , bee-mumbling —</l>
      <l>Oh , sadness , gladness , madness ,</l>
      <l>Of an autumn day at the bridge !</l>
      <l>SONG</l>
      <l>Her voice is vibrant beauty dipt</l>
      <l>In dreams of infinite sorrow and delight .</l>
      <l>Thro ’ an awaiting soul ‘ tis slipt</l>
      <l>And lo , words spring that breathe immortal might .</l>
      <l>TO HER WHO SHALL COME</l>
      <l>1</l>
      <l>Out of the night of lovelessness I call</l>
      <l>Thee , as , in a chill chamber where no ray</l>
      <l>Of unbelievable light and freedom fall ,</l>
      <l>Might cry one manacled ! And tho ’ the way</l>
      <l>Thou'lt come I cannot see ; tho ’ my heart 's sore</l>
      <l>With emptiness when morning 's silent gray</l>
      <l>Wakes me to long aloneness ; yet I know</l>
      <l>Thou hast been with me , who like dawn wilt go</l>
      <l>Beside me , when I have found thee , evermore !</l>
      <l>2</l>
      <l>So in the garden of my heart each day</l>
      <l>I plant thee a flower . Now the pansy , peace ,</l>
      <l>And now the lily , faith — or now a spray</l>
      <l>Of the climbing ivy , hope . And they ne'er cease</l>
      <l>Around the still unblossoming rose of love</l>
      <l>To bend in fragrant tribute to her sway .</l>
      <l>Then — for thy shelter from life 's sultrier suns ,</l>
      <l>The oak of strength I set o'er joy that runs</l>
      <l>With brooklet glee from winds that grieve above .</l>
      <l>3</l>
      <l>But where now art thou ? Watching with love 's eye</l>
      <l>The eve-star wander ? Listening through dim trees</l>
      <l>Some thrilled muezzin of the forest cry</l>
      <l>From his leafy minaret ? Or by the sea 's</l>
      <l>Blue brim , while the spectral moon half o'er it hangs</l>
      <l>Like the faery isle of Avalon , do these</l>
      <l>My yearnings speak to thee of days thy feet</l>
      <l>Have never trod ?— Sweet , sweet , oh , sealing sweet ,</l>
      <l>My own , must be our meeting 's mystic pangs .</l>
      <l>4</l>
      <l>And will be soon ! For last night near to day ,</l>
      <l>Dreaming , God called me thro ’ the space-built sphere</l>
      <l>Of heaven and said , “ Come , waiting one , and lay</l>
      <l>Thine ear unto my Heart — there thou shall hear</l>
      <l>The secrets of this world where evils war . ”</l>
      <l>Such things I heard as must rend mortal clay</l>
      <l>To tell , and trembled — till God , pitying ,</l>
      <l>Said , “ Listen ” ... Oh , my love , I heard thee sing</l>
      <l>Out of thy window to the morning star !</l>
      <l>AVOWAL TO THE NIGHTINGALE</l>
      <l>Though thou hast ne'er unpent thy pain 's delight</l>
      <l>Upon these airs , bird of the poet 's love ,</l>
      <l>Yet must I sing thy singing ! for the Night</l>
      <l>Has poured her jewels o'er the lap of heaven</l>
      <l>As they who 've heard thee say thou dost above</l>
      <l>The wood such ecstasies as were not given</l>
      <l>By nestling breasts of Venus to the dove .</l>
      <l>Oft I have watched the moon orb her fair gold ,</l>
      <l>Still clung to by the tattered mists of day</l>
      <l>And look for thee . Then has my hope grown bold</l>
      <l>Till almost I could see how the near laurels</l>
      <l>Would tremble with thy trembling : but the sway</l>
      <l>Of bards who 've wreathed thee with unfading chorals</l>
      <l>Has held my longing lips from this poor lay .</l>
      <l>None but the sky-hid lark whose spirit is</l>
      <l>Too high for earth may vie for praise with thee</l>
      <l>In aery rhapsody . And since ‘ tis his</l>
      <l>To sing of day and joy as thou of sorrow</l>
      <l>And night o'erhovering singest , thou'lt e'er be</l>
      <l>More dear than he — till hearts shall cease to borrow</l>
      <l>From grief the healing for life 's mystery .</l>
      <l>Then loose thy song ! Though no grave ear may list</l>
      <l>Its lyric trouble , still ‘ tis soothing sweet</l>
      <l>To know that songs unheard and graces missed</l>
      <l>By every eye melt on the skies that nourish</l>
      <l>Us with immortal blue ; and , changed , repeat</l>
      <l>Their protean loveliness in all we cherish .</l>
      <l>For beauty cannot die , howe'er ‘ tmay fleet .</l>
      <l>STORM-EBB</l>
      <l>Dusking amber dimly creeps</l>
      <l>Over the vale ,</l>
      <l>Lit by the kildee 's silver sweeps ,</l>
      <l>Sad with his wail .</l>
      <l>Eastward swing the silent clouds</l>
      <l>Into the night .</l>
      <l>Burdens of day they seem — in crowds</l>
      <l>Hurled from earth 's sight .</l>
      <l>Tilting gulls whip whitely far</l>
      <l>Over the lake ,</l>
      <l>Tirelessly on o'er buoy and spar</l>
      <l>Till they o'ertake</l>
      <l>Shadow and mingled mist — and then</l>
      <l>Vanish to wing</l>
      <l>Still the bewildering night-fen ,</l>
      <l>Where the waves ring .</l>
      <l>Dusking amber dimly dies</l>
      <l>Out of the vale .</l>
      <l>Dead from the dunes the winds arise —</l>
      <l>Ghosts of the gale .</l>
      <l>SLAVES</l>
      <l>A host of bloody centuries lie prone</l>
      <l>Upon the fields of Time — but still the wake</l>
      <l>Of Progress loud is haunted with the groan</l>
      <l>Of myriads , from whose peaceful veins , to slake</l>
      <l>His scarlet thirst , has War , fierce Polypheme</l>
      <l>Of fate , insatiately drunk Life 's stream .</l>
      <l>We bid the courier lightning leap along</l>
      <l>Its metal path with spaceless speed — command</l>
      <l>Stars lost in night-eternity to throng</l>
      <l>Before the magnet eye of Science — stand</l>
      <l>On Glory 's peak and triumphingly cry</l>
      <l>Out mastery of earth and sea and air .</l>
      <l>But unto War 's necessity we bare</l>
      <l>Our piteous breasts — and impotently die .</l>
      <l>WAKING</l>
      <l>Oh , the long dawn , the weary , endless dawn ,</l>
      <l>When sleep 's oblivion is torn away</l>
      <l>From love that died with dying yesterday</l>
      <l>But still unburied in the heart lies on !</l>
      <l>Oh , the sick gray , the twitter in the trees ,</l>
      <l>The sense of human waking o'er the earth !</l>
      <l>The quivering memories of love 's fair birth</l>
      <l>Now strown as deathless flowers o'er its decease !</l>
      <l>Oh , the regret , and oh , regretlessness ,</l>
      <l>Striving for sovranty within the soul !</l>
      <l>Oh , fear that life shall never more be whole ,</l>
      <l>And immortality but make it less !</l>
      <l>FAUN-CALL</l>
      <l>Oh , who is he will follow me</l>
      <l>With a singing ,</l>
      <l>Down sunny roads where windy odes</l>
      <l>Of the woods are ringing ?</l>
      <l>Where leaves are tossed from branches lost</l>
      <l>In a tangle</l>
      <l>Of vines that vie to clamber high —</l>
      <l>But to vault and dangle !</l>
      <l>Oh , who is he ?— His eye must be</l>
      <l>As a lover 's</l>
      <l>To leap and woo the chicory 's hue</l>
      <l>In the hazel-hovers !</l>
      <l>His hope must dance like radiance</l>
      <l>O'er the shadows</l>
      <l>Of clouds that fling their threatening</l>
      <l>On the stubbly meadows !</l>
      <l>And he must see that Autumn 's glee</l>
      <l>And her laughter</l>
      <l>From his lips and heart will quell all smart —</l>
      <l>Of before and after !</l>
      <l>LINGERING</l>
      <l>I lingered still when you were gone ,</l>
      <l>When tryst and trust were o'er ,</l>
      <l>While memory like a wounded swan</l>
      <l>In sorrow sung love 's lore .</l>
      <l>I lingered till the whippoorwill</l>
      <l>Had cried delicious pain</l>
      <l>Over the wild-wood — in its thrill</l>
      <l>I heard your voice again .</l>
      <l>I lingered and the mellow breeze</l>
      <l>Blew to me sweetly dewed —</l>
      <l>Its touch awoke the sorceries</l>
      <l>Your last caresses brewed .</l>
      <l>But when the night with silent start</l>
      <l>Had sown her starry seed ,</l>
      <l>The harvest which sprang in my heart</l>
      <l>Was loneliness and need .</l>
      <l>STORM-TWILIGHT</l>
      <l>Tossing , swirling , swept by the wind ,</l>
      <l>Beaten abaft by the rain ,</l>
      <l>The swallows high in the sodden sky</l>
      <l>Circle oft and again .</l>
      <l>They rise and sink and drift and swing ,</l>
      <l>Twitterless in the chill ;</l>
      <l>A-haste , for stark is the coming dark</l>
      <l>Over the wet of the hill .</l>
      <l>Wildly , swiftly , at last they stream</l>
      <l>Into their chimney home .</l>
      <l>A livid gash in the west , a crash —</l>
      <l>Then silence , sadness , gloam .</l>
      <l>WILDNESS</l>
      <l>To drift with the drifting clouds ,</l>
      <l>And blow with the blow of breezes ,</l>
      <l>To ripple with waves and murmur with caves ,</l>
      <l>To soar , as the sea-mew pleases !</l>
      <l>To dip with the dipping sails ,</l>
      <l>And burn with the burning heaven —</l>
      <l>My life ! my soul ! for the infinite roll</l>
      <l>Of a day to wildness given !</l>
      <l>BEFORE AUTUMN</l>
      <l>Summer 's last moon has waned —</l>
      <l>Waned</l>
      <l>As amber fires</l>
      <l>Of an Aztec shrine .</l>
      <l>The invisible breath of coming death has stained</l>
      <l>The withering leaves with its nepenthean wine —</l>
      <l>Autumn 's near .</l>
      <l>Winds in the woodland moan —</l>
      <l>Moan</l>
      <l>As memories</l>
      <l>Of a chilling yore .</l>
      <l>Magnolia seeds like Indian beads are strewn</l>
      <l>From crimson pods along the earth 's sere floor —</l>
      <l>Autumn 's near .</l>
      <l>Solitude slowly steals ,</l>
      <l>Steals</l>
      <l>Her silent way</l>
      <l>By the songless brook .</l>
      <l>At the gnarly yoke of a solemn oak she kneels ,</l>
      <l>The musing joy of sadness in her look —</l>
      <l>Autumn 's near .</l>
      <l>Yes , with her golden days —</l>
      <l>Days</l>
      <l>When hope and toil</l>
      <l>Are at peace and rest —</l>
      <l>Autumn is near , and the tired year ‘ mid praise</l>
      <l>Lies down with leaf and blossom on her breast —</l>
      <l>Autumn 's near .</l>
      <l>FULFILMENT</l>
      <l>A-bask in the mellow beauty of the ripening sun ,</l>
      <l>Sad with the lingering sense of summer 's purpose done ,</l>
      <l>The cut and searing fields stretch from me one by one</l>
      <l>Along the creek .</l>
      <l>The corn-stooks drop their shadows down the fallow hill ;</l>
      <l>Wearing autumnal warmth the farm sleeps by the mill ,</l>
      <l>Around each heavy eave low smoke hangs blue and still —</l>
      <l>Life 's flow is weak .</l>
      <l>Along the weedy roads and lanes I walk — or pause —</l>
      <l>Ponder a fallen nut or quirking crow whose caws</l>
      <l>Seem with prehuman hintings fraught or ancient awes</l>
      <l>Of forest-deeps .</l>
      <l>Of forest deeps the pale-face hunter never trod ,</l>
      <l>Nor Indian , with the silent stealth of Nature shod ;</l>
      <l>Deeps tense with the timelessness and solitude of God</l>
      <l>Who never sleeps .</l>
      <l>And many times has Autumn , on her harvest way ,</l>
      <l>Gathered again into the earth leaf , fruit , and spray ;</l>
      <l>Here many times dwelt rueful as she dwells to-day ,</l>
      <l>The while she reaps .</l>
      <l>TO THE FALLEN LEAVES</l>
      <l>I hear the moaning rains beat on your rest</l>
      <l>In the long nights of Winter and his wind —</l>
      <l>And Death , the woeful , guilty of your fall ,</l>
      <l>Crying that he has sinned .</l>
      <l>MAYA</l>
      <stage>HIROSHIMA , JAPAN , 1905</stage>
      <l>Pale sampans up the river glide</l>
      <l>With set sails vanishing and slow ;</l>
      <l>In the blue west the mountains hide</l>
      <l>As visions that too soon will go .</l>
      <l>Across the rice-lands flooded deep</l>
      <l>The peasant peacefully wades on —</l>
      <l>As in unfurrowed vales of sleep ,</l>
      <l>A phantom out of voidness drawn .</l>
      <l>Over the temple cawing flies</l>
      <l>The crow with carrion in his beak .</l>
      <l>Buddha within lifts not his eyes</l>
      <l>In pity or reproval meek ;</l>
      <l>Nor , in the bamboos , where they bow</l>
      <l>A respite from the blinding sun ,</l>
      <l>The old priest — dreaming painless how</l>
      <l>Nirvana 's calm will come when won .</l>
      <l>“ All is allusion , Maya , all</l>
      <l>The world of will , ” the spent East seems</l>

      <l>SPIRIT OF RAIN</l>
      <stage>MIYANOSHITA , JAPAN , 1905</stage>
      <l>Spirit of rain —</l>
      <l>With all thy ghosts of mist about the mountain , lonely</l>
      <l>As a gray train</l>
      <l>Of souls newly discarnate seeking new life only !</l>
      <l>Spirit of rain !</l>
      <l>Leading them thro ’ dim torii , up fane-ways onward</l>
      <l>Till not in vain</l>
      <l>They tremble upon the peaks and plunge rejoicing dawnward .</l>
      <l>Spirit of rain !</l>
      <l>So would I lead my dead thoughts high and higher ,</l>
      <l>Till they regain</l>
      <l>Birth and the beauty of a new life 's fire .</l>
      <l>THE NYMPH AND THE GOD</l>
      <l>She lay by the river dead ,</l>
      <l>A broken reed in her hand ,</l>
      <l>The nymph whom an idle god had wed</l>
      <l>And led from her maidenland .</l>
      <l>The god was the great god , Jove .</l>
      <l>Two notes would the bent reed blow ,</l>
      <l>The one was sorrow , the other love ,</l>
      <l>Enwove with a woman 's woe .</l>
      <l>She lay by the river dead ,</l>
      <l>And he at feasting forgot .</l>
      <l>The gods , shall they be disquieted</l>
      <l>By dread of a mortal 's lot ?</l>
      <l>A SEA-GHOST</l>
      <l>Oh , fisher-fleet , go in from the sea</l>
      <l>And furl your wings .</l>
      <l>The bay is gray with the twilit spray</l>
      <l>And the loud surf springs .</l>
      <l>The chill buoy-bell is rung by the hands</l>
      <l>Of all the drowned ,</l>
      <l>Who know the woe of the wind and tow</l>
      <l>Of the tides around .</l>
      <l>Go in , go in ! O haste from the sea ,</l>
      <l>And let them rest —</l>
      <l>A son and one who was wed and one</l>
      <l>Who went down unblest .</l>
      <l>Aye , even as I whose hands at the bell</l>
      <l>Now labour most .</l>
      <l>The tomb has gloom , but O the doom</l>
      <l>Of the drear sea-ghost !</l>
      <l>He evermore must wander the ooze</l>
      <l>Beneath the wave ,</l>
      <l>Forlorn — to warn of the tempest born ,</l>
      <l>And to save — to save !</l>
      <l>Then go , go in ! and leave us the sea ,</l>
      <l>For only so</l>
      <l>Can peace release us and give us ease</l>
      <l>Of our salty woe .</l>
      <l>LAST SIGHT OF LAND</l>
      <l>The clouds in woe hang far and dim :</l>
      <l>I look again and lo</l>
      <l>Only a faint and shadow line</l>
      <l>Of shore — I watch it go .</l>
      <l>The gulls have left the ship and wheel</l>
      <l>Back to the cliff 's gray wraith .</l>
      <l>Will it be so of all our thoughts</l>
      <l>When we set sail on Death ?</l>
      <l>And what will the last sight be of life</l>
      <l>As lone we fare and fast ?</l>
      <l>Grief and the face we love in mist —</l>
      <l>Then night and awe too vast ?</l>
      <l>Or the dear light of Hope — like that ,</l>
      <l>O see , from the lost shore</l>
      <l>Kindling and calling “ Onward , you</l>
      <l>Shall reach the Evermore ! ”</l>
      <l>SILENCE</l>
      <l>Silence is song unheard ,</l>
      <l>Is beauty never born ,</l>
      <l>Is light forgotten — left unstirred</l>

     <speaker>SCENE : A Hall of Judgment in the palace of SAUL at Gibeah</speaker>
     <p>The walls and pillars of cedar are richly carven — with serpents , pomegranates , and cherubim in gold . The floors are of bright marble ; the throne of ivory hung with a lion 's skin whose head is its footstool . On the right , by the throne , and on the left are doors to other portions of the palace ; they are draped with woven curtains of purple and white . In the rear , which is open and supported on pillars , a porch crosses a court . Through the porch , on the environing hills , glow the camp-fires of the Philistines , the enemies of Israel . Lamps in the Hall burn low , and on the floor JUDITH , LEAH and ZILLA are reclining restively . Judith<stage>springing to her feet impatiently</stage>O for a feast , pomegranate wine and song !</p>

     <stage>SCENE : A savage mountain-cliff in the wilderness of Engeddi . On either side grey crags rise rugged , sinking away precipitously across the back . Cut into each is a cave . The height is reached by clefts from all sides . Between the crags to the East is the far blue of the Dead Sea ; and still beyond , bathed in the waning afternoon , stretch the purple shores of Moab . During the act the scene grows crimson with sunset and a thundercloud arises over the sea . Lying on a pallet of skins near the cliff 's verge , DAVID tosses feverishly . Three of his followers and a lad , who serves him , are gathered toward the front , ragged , hungry , and hunted , in altercation over a barley cake .</stage>

At the back to one side , the teraphim , or image of divination ; on the other side a stairway mounts to the roof . Above is the night and vague lightning amid a moan of wind .

     <p>And my brother Jonathan ! If I believe it will not miracle Alone bring joy again unto my pain ?<stage>The wailing again , and deeper groans .</stage>O Israel , the Infinite has touched Thy glory and it changes to a shroud ! Thy splendour is as vintage overspilt , For Saul upon the mountains low is lying , And Jonathan beside him , beautiful Beyond the mar of battle and of death . Yea , kingly Jonathan ! And I would give The beating of my life into his veins . Willing for it would I be drouth and die !...<stage>As the wails re-arise .</stage>Peaks , mountains of Gilboa ! let no more Dew be upon you , and as sackcloth let Clouds cover you , and ashes be your soil , Until I bring upon Philistia And Gath and Askalon extinguishing , And sorrow — and immensity of tears !<stage>MICHAL goes to him . He folds her in his arms .</stage>But we must calm the flowing of this grief . Though yet we cannot mind us to remember , Love will as sandal-breath and trickling balm O'erheal us in the unbegotten years , Too headlong must not be our agony . Hush now thy woundedness , my Michal , now . See , o'er the East the lifted wings of Dawn .</p>

    <stage>They climb the stair to the house-top . As they look away toward the battle 's rout the clouds part , and over them breaks the full brightness of the sun ....</stage>
