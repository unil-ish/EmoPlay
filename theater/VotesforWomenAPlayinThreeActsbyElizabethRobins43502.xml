    <stage>Illustration : Stage setting . ] Twelve o'clock Sunday morning at end of June . Action takes place between twelve and six same day . VOTES FOR WOMEN ACT I HALL OF WYNNSTAY HOUSE . Twelve o'clock , Sunday morning , end of June . With the rising of the Curtain , enter the BUTLER . As he is going , with majestic port , to answer the door L ., enter briskly from the garden , by lower French window , LADY JOHN WYNNSTAY , flushed , and flapping a garden hat to fan herself . She is a pink-cheeked woman of fifty-four , who has plainly been a beauty , keeps her complexion , but is “ gone to fat . ”</stage>

     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>Has Miss Levering come down yet ? BUTLER<stage>pausing C .</stage>I have n't seen her , m'lady . LADY JOHN<stage>almost sharply as BUTLER turns L .</stage>I wo n't have her disturbed if she 's resting .<stage>To herself as she goes to writing-table .</stage>She certainly needs it .</p>

     <p>Yes , m'lady . LADY JOHN<stage>sitting at writing-table , her back to front door</stage>But I want her to know the moment she comes down that the new plans arrived by the morning post . BUTLER<stage>pausing nearly at the door</stage>Plans , m'la ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>She 'll understand . There they are .<stage>Glancing at the clock .</stage>It 's very important she should have them in time to look over before she goes ——</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>BUTLER</speaker>
     <p>No , m'lady . Mr. Farnborough .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Exit BUTLER .</stage>
    <stage>Enter the HON . R. FARNBOROUGH . He is twenty-six ; reddish hair , high-coloured , sanguine , self-important .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARNBOROUGH</speaker>
     <p>I 'm afraid I 'm scandalously early . It did n't take me nearly as long to motor over as Lord John said . LADY JOHN<stage>shaking hands</stage>I 'm afraid my husband is no authority on motoring — and he 's not home yet from church .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p>It 's the greatest luck finding you . I thought Miss Levering was the only person under this roof who was ever allowed to observe Sunday as a real Day of Rest .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>If you 've come to see Miss Levering ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p>Is she here ? I give you my word I did n't know it . LADY JOHN<stage>unconvinced</stage>Oh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p>Does she come every week-end ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>Whenever we can get her to . But we 've only known her a couple of months .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p>And I have only known her three weeks ! Lady John , I 've come to ask you to help me . LADY JOHN<stage>quickly</stage>With Miss Levering ? I can n't do it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>No , no — all that 's no good . She only laughs .</l>

      <l>Ah !— she looks upon you as a boy .</l>
      <l>FARN</l>

      <l>Such rot ! What do you think she said to me in</l>
      <l>London the other day ?</l>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>That she was four years older than you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I knew that . No . She said she knew she was all the charming things I 'd been saying , but there was only one way to prove it — and that was to marry some one young enough to be her son . She 'd noticed that was what the most attractive women did — and she named names . LADY JOHN<stage>laughing</stage>You were too old !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p><stage>nods</stage>Her future husband , she said , was probably just entering Eton .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>Just like her !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p><stage>waving the subject away</stage>No . I wanted to see you about the Secretaryship .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>You did n't get it , then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p>No . It 's the grief of my life .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>Oh , if you do n't get one you 'll get another .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p>But there is only one .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>Only one vacancy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p>Only one man I 'd give my ears to work for . LADY JOHN<stage>smiling</stage>I remember .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p><stage>quickly</stage>Do I always talk about Stonor ? Well , it 's a habit people have got into .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>I forget , do you know Mr. Stonor personally , or<stage>smiling</stage>are you just dazzled from afar ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I know him . The trouble is he does n't know me . If he did he 'd realise he can n't be sure of winning his election without my valuable services .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>Geoffrey Stonor 's re-election is always a foregone conclusion .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p>That the great man shares that opinion is precisely his weak point .<stage>Smiling .</stage>His only one .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>You think because the Liberals swept the country the last time ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>How can we be sure any Conservative seat is safe after ——</l>
      <stage>As LADY JOHN smiles and turns to her papers .</stage>
      <l>Forgive me , I know you 're not interested in politics qua politics .</l>
      <l>But this concerns Geoffrey Stonor .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>And you count on my being interested in him like all the rest of my sex .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p><stage>leans forward</stage>Lady John , I 've heard the news .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>What news ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>That your little niece — the Scotch heiress — is going to become</l>
      <l>Mrs. Geoffrey Stonor .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>Who told you that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p>Please do n't mind my knowing . LADY JOHN<stage>visibly perturbed</stage>She had set her heart upon having a few days with just her family in the secret , before the flood of congratulations breaks loose .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p>Oh , that 's all right . I always hear things before other people .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>Well , I must ask you to be good enough to be very circumspect . I would n't have my niece think that I ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p>Oh , of course not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>She will be here in an hour .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p><stage>jumping up delighted</stage>What ? To-day ? The future Mrs. Stonor ! LADY JOHN<stage>harassed</stage>Yes . Unfortunately we had one or two people already asked for the week-end ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p>And I go and invite myself to luncheon ! Lady John , you can buy me off . I 'll promise to remove myself in five minutes if you 'll ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>No , the penalty is you shall stay and keep the others amused between church and luncheon , and so leave me free .<stage>Takes up the plan .</stage>Only remember ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p>Wild horses wo n't get a hint out of me ! I only mentioned it to you because — since we 've come back to live in this part of the world you 've been so awfully kind — I thought , I hoped maybe you — you 'd put in a word for me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>With ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p>With your nephew that is to be . Though I 'm not the slavish satellite people make out , you can n't doubt ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I do n't doubt . But you know Mr. Stonor inspires a similar enthusiasm in a good many young ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p>They have n't studied the situation as I have . They do n't know what 's at stake . They do n't go to that hole Dutfield as I did just to hear his Friday speech .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>Ah ! But you were rewarded . Jean — my niece — wrote me it was “ glorious . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p><stage>judicially</stage>Well , you know , I was disappointed . He 's too content just to criticise , just to make his delicate pungent fun of the men who are grappling — very inadequately , of course — still grappling with the big questions . There 's a carrying power<stage>gets up and faces an imaginary audience</stage>— some of Stonor 's friends ought to point it out — there 's a driving power in the poorest constructive policy that makes the most brilliant criticism look barren . LADY JOHN<stage>with good-humoured malice</stage>Who told you that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p>You think there 's nothing in it because I say it . But now that he 's coming into the family , Lord John or somebody really ought to point out — Stonor 's overdoing his role of magnificent security !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>I do n't see even Lord John offering to instruct Mr. Stonor .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p>Believe me , that 's just Stonor 's danger ! Nobody saying a word , everybody hoping he 's on the point of adopting some definite line , something strong and original that 's going to fire the public imagination and bring the Tories back into power .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>So he will .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p><stage>hotly</stage>Not if he disappoints meetings — goes calmly up to town — and leaves the field to the Liberals .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>When did he do anything like that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p>Yesterday !<stage>With a harassed air .</stage>And now that he 's got this other preoccupation ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>You mean ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p>Yes , your niece — that spoilt child of Fortune . Of course !<stage>Stopping suddenly .</stage>She kept him from the meeting last night . Well !<stage>sits down</stage>if that 's the effect she 's going to have it 's pretty serious ! LADY JOHN<stage>smiling</stage>You are !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p>I can assure you the election agent 's more so . He 's simply tearing his hair . LADY JOHN<stage>more gravely and coming nearer</stage>How do you know ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p>He told me so himself — yesterday . I scraped acquaintance with the agent just to see if — if ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>It 's not only here that you manoeuvre for that</l>
      <l>Secretaryship !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p><stage>confidentially</stage>You can never tell when your chance might come ! That election chap 's promised to keep me posted .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The door flies open and JEAN DUNBARTON rushes in .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Aunt Ellen — here I ——</l>
      <l>LADY JOHN</l>
      <stage>astonished</stage>
      <l>My dear child !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <stage>They embrace . Enter LORD JOHN from the garden — a benevolent , silver-haired despot of sixty-two .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LORD JOHN</speaker>
     <p>I thought that was you running up the avenue .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>JEAN greets her uncle warmly , but all the time she and her aunt talk together . “ How did you get here so early ? ” “ I knew you 'd be surprised — was n't it clever of me to manage it ? I do n't deserve all the credit . ” “ But there is n't any train between —— ” “ Yes , wait till I tell you . ” “ You walked in the broiling sun —— ” “ No , no . ” “ You must be dead . Why did n't you telegraph ? I ordered the carriage to meet the 1. 10 . Did n't you say the 1. 10 ? Yes , I 'm sure you did — here 's your letter . ”</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LORD J</speaker>
     <p><stage>has shaken hands with FARNBOROUGH and speaks through the torrent</stage>Now they 'll tell each other for ten minutes that she 's an hour earlier than we expected .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>LORD JOHN leads FARNBOROUGH towards the garden .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p>The Freddy Tunbridges said they were coming to you this week .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LORD J</speaker>
     <p>Yes , they 're dawdling through the park with the Church Brigade .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p>Oh !<stage>With a glance back at JEAN .</stage>I 'll go and meet them .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Exit FARNBOROUGH .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LORD J</speaker>
     <p><stage>as he turns back</stage>That discreet young man will get on . LADY JOHN<stage>to JEAN</stage>But how did you get here ? JEAN<stage>breathless</stage>“ He ” motored me down .</p>

     <p>He dropped me at the end of the avenue and went on to see a supporter about something .</p>

     <speaker>LORD J</speaker>
     <p><stage>indulgently to MR. FREDDY and FARNBOROUGH</stage>Philanthropy in a woman like Miss Levering is a form of restlessness . But she 's a nice creature ; all she needs is to get some “ nice ” fella to marry her .</p>

    <stage>Voices outside . Enter fussily , talking and gesticulating , ST. JOHN GREATOREX , followed by MISS LEVERING and FARNBOROUGH . GREATOREX is sixty , wealthy , a county magnate , and Liberal M. P . He is square , thick-set , square-bearded . His shining bald pate has two strands of coal-black hair trained across his crown from left ear to right and securely pasted there . He has small , twinkling eyes and a reputation for telling good stories after dinner when ladies have left the room . He is carrying a little book for MISS LEVERING . She ( parasol over shoulder ) , an attractive , essentially feminine , and rather “ smart ” woman of thirty-two , with a somewhat foreign grace ; the kind of whom men and women alike say , “ What 's her story ? Why does n't she marry ? ”</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GREATOREX</speaker>
     <p>I protest ! Good Lord ! what are the women of this country coming to ? I protest against Miss Levering being carried off to discuss anything so revolting . Bless my soul ! what can a woman like you know about it ? MISS LEVERING<stage>smiling</stage>Little enough . Good morning .</p>

     <p>“ A few ! ” That 's really rather forbearing of you , Mr. Greatorex . I 'm afraid the number of the discontented and the hungry was 96 , 000 — among the mill operatives alone .<stage>Hastily .</stage>At least the papers said so , did n't they ?</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Ah , then you 'll be interested in the girl I saw dying in a Tramp Ward a little while ago . Glad her cough was worse — only she must n't die before her father . Two reasons . Nobody but her to keep the old man out of the workhouse — and “ father is so proud . ” If she died first , he would starve ; worst of all he might hear what had happened up in London to his girl .</p>

     <p>She did n't say , I suppose , how she happened to fall so low .</p>

     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Yes , she had been in service . She lost the train back one Sunday night and was too terrified of her employer to dare ring him up after hours . The wrong person found her crying on the platform .</p>

     <speaker>MRS. H</speaker>
     <p>Near a public-house , I suppose .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Yes , a sort of “ public-house . ” She was plainly dying — she was told she should n't be out in the rain . “ I must n't go in yet , ” she said . “ This is what he gave me , ” and she began to cry . In her hand were two pennies silvered over to look like half-crowns .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>MRS. H</speaker>
     <p>I do n't believe that story . It 's just the sort of thing some sensation-monger trumps up — now , who tells you such ——</p>

     <p>She was dead . I went to London to a small hotel and tried to find employment . I wandered about all day and every day from agency to agency . I was supposed to be educated .

My body was n't born weak , and my spirit was n't broken by the habit of slavery . But , as Mrs. Heriot was kind enough to hint , I do know something about the possible fate of homeless girls . I found there were pleasant parks , museums , free libraries in our great rich London — and not one single place where destitute women can be sure of work that is n't killing or food that is n't worse than prison fare . That 's why women ought not to sleep o ’ nights till this Shelter stands spreading out wide arms .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. H</speaker>
     <p>That was my doing . But I did n't bargain for her being introduced to you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>She seems to go everywhere . And why should n't she ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. H</speaker>
     <p><stage>quickly</stage>You must n't ask her to Eaton Square .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>I have .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. H</speaker>
     <p>Then you 'll have to get out of it . JEAN<stage>with a stubborn look</stage>I must have a reason . And a very good reason .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. H</speaker>
     <p>Well , it 's not a thing I should have preferred to tell you , but I know how difficult you are to guide ... so I suppose you 'll have to know .<stage>Lowering her voice .</stage>It was ten or twelve years ago . I found her horribly ill in a lonely Welsh farmhouse . We had taken the Manor for that August . The farmer 's wife was frightened , and begged me to go and see what I thought . I soon saw how it was — I thought she was dying .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>Dying ! What was the ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. H</speaker>
     <p>I got no more out of her than the farmer 's wife did . She had had no letters . There had been no one to see her except a man down from London , a shady-looking doctor — nameless , of course . And then this result . The farmer and his wife , highly respectable people , were incensed . They were for turning the girl out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>Oh ! but ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. H</speaker>
     <p>Yes . Pitiless some of these people are ! I insisted they should treat the girl humanely , and we became friends ... that is , “ sort of . ” In spite of all I did for her ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>What did you do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. H</speaker>
     <p>I — I 've told you , and I lent her money . No small sum either .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>Has she never paid it back ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. H</speaker>
     <p>Oh , yes , after a time . But I always kept her secret — as much as I knew of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>But you 've been telling me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. H</speaker>
     <p>That was my duty — and I never had her full confidence .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>Was n't it natural she ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. H</speaker>
     <p>Well , all things considered , she might have wanted to tell me who was responsible .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>Oh ! Aunt Lydia !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. H</speaker>
     <p>All she ever said was that she was ashamed —<stage>losing her temper and her fine feeling for the innocence of her auditor</stage>— ashamed that she “ had n't had the courage to resist ” — not the original temptation but the pressure brought to bear on her “ not to go through with it , ” as she said . JEAN<stage>wrinkling her brows</stage>You are being so delicate — I 'm not sure I understand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. H</speaker>
     <p><stage>irritably</stage>The only thing you need understand is that she 's not a desirable companion for a young girl .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Pause .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>When did you see her after — after ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. H</speaker>
     <p><stage>with a slight grimace</stage>I met her last winter at the Bishop 's .<stage>Hurriedly .</stage>She 's a connection of his wife 's . They 'd got her to help with some of their work . Then she took hold of ours . Your aunt and uncle are quite foolish about her , and I 'm debarred from taking any steps , at least till the Shelter is out of hand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>I do rather wonder she can bring herself to talk about — the unfortunate women of the world .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. H</speaker>
     <p>The effrontery of it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>Or ... the courage !<stage>Puts her hand up to her throat as if the sentence had caught there .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. H</speaker>
     <p>Even presumes to set me right ! Of course I do n't mind in the least , poor soul ... but I feel I owe it to your dead mother to tell you about her , especially as you 're old enough now to know something about life —— JEAN<stage>slowly</stage>— and since a girl need n't be very old to suffer for her ignorance .<stage>Moves a little away .</stage>I felt she was rather wonderful .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. H</speaker>
     <p>Wonderful ! JEAN<stage>pausing</stage>To have lived through that when she was ... how old ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. H</speaker>
     <p><stage>rising</stage>Oh , nineteen or thereabouts .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>Five years younger than I . To be abandoned and to come out of it like this !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. H</speaker>
     <p><stage>laying her hand on the girl 's shoulder</stage>It was too bad to have to tell you such a sordid story to-day of all days .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>It is a very terrible story , but this was n't a bad time . I feel very sorry to-day for women who are n't happy .</p>

     <p>Who do you think is motoring up the drive ? JEAN<stage>catching hold of him</stage>Oh , dear ! how am I ever going to be able to behave like a girl who is n't engaged to the only man in the world worth marrying ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. H</speaker>
     <p>You were expecting Mr. Stonor all the time !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>He promised he 'd come to luncheon if it was humanly possible ; but</l>
      <l>I was afraid to tell you for fear he 'd be prevented .</l>

     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>I felt I could n't .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The lobby door opens . LADY JOHN appears radiant , followed by a tall figure in a dust-coat , &amp; c ., no goggles . He has straight , firm features , a little blunt ; fair skin , high-coloured ; fine , straight hair , very fair ; grey eyes , set somewhat prominently and heavy when not interested ; lips full , but firmly moulded . GEOFFREY STONOR is heavier than a man of forty should be , but otherwise in the pink of physical condition . The FOOTMAN stands waiting to help him off with his motor coat .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>Here 's an agreeable surprise !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>JEAN has gone forward only a step , and stands smiling at the approaching figure .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LORD J</speaker>
     <p>How do you do ?<stage>As he comes between them and briskly shakes hands with STONOR .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <stage>FARNBOROUGH appears at the French window .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p>Yes , by Jove !<stage>Turning to the others clustered round the window .</stage>What gigantic luck !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Those outside crane and glance , and then elaborately turn their backs and pretend to be talking among themselves , but betray as far as manners permit the enormous sensation the arrival has created .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>How do you do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Shakes hands with MRS. HERIOT , who has rushed up to him with both hers outstretched . He crosses to JEAN , who meets him half way ; they shake hands , smiling into each other 's eyes .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>Such a long time since we met !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LORD J</speaker>
     <p><stage>to STONOR</stage>You 're growing very enterprising . I could hardly believe my ears when I heard you 'd motored all the way from town to see a supporter on Sunday .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know how we covered the ground in the old days .<stage>To LADY JOHN .</stage>It 's no use to stand for your borough any more . The American , you know , he “ runs ” for Congress . By and by we shall all be flying after the thing we want .</p>

     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>Oh — how d'you do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p>Some of them were arguing in the smoking-room last night whether it did n't hurt a man 's chances going about in a motor .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LORD J</speaker>
     <p>Yes , we 've been hearing a lot of stories about the unpopularity of motor-cars — among the class that has n't got ‘ em , of course . What do you say ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sure you gain more votes by being able to reach so many more of your constituency than we used ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>Well , I do n't know — I 've sometimes wondered whether the charm of our presence was n't counterbalanced by the way we tear about smothering our fellow-beings in dust and running down their pigs and chickens , not to speak of their children .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LORD J</speaker>
     <p><stage>anxiously</stage>What on the whole are the prospects ?<stage>FARNBOROUGH cranes forward .</stage>STONOR<stage>gravely</stage>We shall have to work harder than we realised .</p>

     <speaker>FARN</speaker>
     <p>Ah !<stage>Retires towards group .</stage>JEAN<stage>in a half-aside as she slips her arm in her uncle 's and smiles at GEOFFREY</stage>He says he believes I 'll be able to make a real difference to his chances . Is n't it angelic of him ? STONOR<stage>in a jocular tone</stage>Angelic ? Macchiavelian . I pin all my hopes on your being able to counteract the pernicious influence of my opponent 's glib wife .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>You want me to have a real share in it all , do n't you ,</l>
      <l>Geoffrey ?</l>
      <l>STONOR</l>
      <stage>smiling into her eyes</stage>
      <l>Of course I do .</l>

    <stage>FARNBOROUGH drops down again on pretence of talking to MRS. HERIOT .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LORD J</speaker>
     <p>I do n't gather you 're altogether sanguine . Any complication ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>JEAN and LADY JOHN stand close together ( C .) , the girl radiant , following STONOR with her eyes and whispering to the sympathetic elder woman .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>Well<stage>taking Sunday paper out of pocket</stage>, there 's this agitation about the Woman Question . Oddly enough , it seems likely to affect the issue .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LORD J</speaker>
     <p>Why should it ? Ca n't you do what the other four hundred have done ? STONOR<stage>laughs</stage>Easily . But , you see , the mere fact that four hundred and twenty members have been worried into promising support — and then once in the House have let the matter severely alone ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LORD J</speaker>
     <p><stage>to STONOR</stage>Let it alone ! Bless my soul , I should think so indeed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>Of course . Only it 's a device that 's somewhat worn .</p>

    <stage>Enter MISS LEVERING , with hat on ; gloves and veil in her hand .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LORD J</speaker>
     <p>Still if they think they 're getting a future Cabinet Minister on their side ——</p>

     <p>it will be sufficiently embarrassing for the Cabinet Minister .<stage>STONOR turns to speak to JEAN . Stops dead seeing MISS LEVERING .</stage>JEAN<stage>smiling</stage>You know one another ?</p>

     <p>Ah , that was before he knew her revolting views .</p>

     <p>Yes , it was .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. F</speaker>
     <p>It 's true what that old cynic says . The scene in the House has put back the reform a generation .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>I wish ‘ d been there .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. F</speaker>
     <p>I was .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>Oh , was it like the papers said ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. F</speaker>
     <p>Worse . I 've never been so moved in public . No tragedy , no great opera ever gripped an audience as the situation in the House did that night . There we all sat breathless — with everything more favourable to us than it had been within the memory of women . Another five minutes and the Resolution would have passed . Then ... all in a moment —— LADY JOHN<stage>to MRS. HERIOT</stage>Listen — they 're talking about the female hooligans .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. H</speaker>
     <p>No , thank you !<stage>Sits apart with the “ Church Times . ”</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. F</speaker>
     <p><stage>excitedly</stage>All in a moment a horrible dingy little flag was poked through the grille of the Woman 's Gallery — cries — insults — scuffling — the police — the ignominious turning out of the women — us as well as the —— Oh , I can n't think of it without ——</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Jumps up and walks to and fro .</stage>
    <stage>Pauses . ) Then the next morning ! The people gloating . Our friends antagonised — people who were wavering — nearly won over — all thrown back — heart breaking ! Even my husband ! Freddy 's been an angel about letting me take my share when I felt I must — but of course I 've always known he does n't really like it . It makes him shy . I 'm sure it gives him a horrid twist inside when he sees my name among the speakers on the placards . But he 's always been an angel about it before this . After the disgraceful scene he said , “ It just shows how unfit women are for any sort of coherent thinking or concerted action . ”</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>To think that it should be women who 've given the Cause the worst blow it ever had !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. F</speaker>
     <p>The work of forty years destroyed in five minutes !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>They must have felt pretty sick when they woke up the next morning — the Suffragettes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. F</speaker>
     <p>I do n't waste any sympathy on them . I 'm thinking of the penalty all women have to pay because a handful of hysterical ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>Still I think I 'm sorry for them . It must be dreadful to find you 've done such a lot of harm to the thing you care most about in the world .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Do you picture the Suffragettes sitting in sackcloth ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. F</speaker>
     <p>Well , they can n't help realising now what they 've done .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p><stage>quietly</stage>Is n't it just possible they realise they 've waked up interest in the Woman Question so that it 's advertised in every paper and discussed in every house from Land 's End to John o'Groats ? Do n't you think they know there 's been more said and written about it in these ten days since the scene , than in the ten years before it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. F</speaker>
     <p>You are n't saying you think it was a good way to get what they wanted ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>And men have only laughed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>But they 'd come round .<stage>She looks from one to the other .</stage>Mrs. Tunbridge says , before that horrid scene , everything was favourable at last .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>At last ? Had n't it been just as “ favourable ” before ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. F</speaker>
     <p>No . We 'd never had so many members pledged to our side .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>I thought I 'd heard somebody say the Bill had got as far as that , time and time again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>Oh no . Surely not ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. F</speaker>
     <p><stage>reluctantly</stage>Y-yes . This was only a Resolution . The Bill passed a second reading thirty-seven years ago . JEAN<stage>with wide eyes</stage>And what difference did it make ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>The men laughed rather louder .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. F</speaker>
     <p>Oh , it 's got as far as a second reading several times — but we never had so many friends in the House before ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p><stage>with a faint smile</stage>“ Friends ! ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>Why do you say it like that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps because I was thinking of a funny story — he said it was funny — a Liberal Whip told me the other day . A Radical Member went out of the House after his speech in favour of the Woman 's Bill , and as he came back half an hour later , he heard some Members talking in the Lobby about the astonishing number who were going to vote for the measure . And the Friend of Woman dropped his jaw and clutched the man next him : “ My God ! ” he said , “ you do n't mean to say they 're going to give it to them ! ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>Oh !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. F</speaker>
     <p>You do n't think all men in Parliament are like that !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>I do n't think all men are burglars , but I lock my doors . JEAN<stage>below her breath</stage>You think that night of the scene — you think the men did n't mean to play fair ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p><stage>her coolness in contrast to the excitement of the others</stage>Did n't the women sit quiet till ten minutes to closing time ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>Ten minutes to settle a question like that !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p><stage>quietly to MRS. FREDDY</stage>Could n't you see the men were at their old game ? LADY JOHN<stage>coming forward</stage>You think they were just putting off the issue till it was too late ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p><stage>in a detached tone</stage>I was n't there , but I have n't heard anybody deny that the women waited till ten minutes to eleven . Then they discovered the policeman who 'd been sent up at the psychological moment to the back of the gallery . Then , I 'm told , when the women saw they were betrayed once more , they utilised the few minutes left , to impress on the country at large the fact of their demands — did it in the only way left them .<stage>Sits leaning forward reflectively smiling , chin in hand .</stage>It does rather look to the outsider as if the well-behaved women had worked for forty years and made less impression on the world then those fiery young women made in five minutes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. F</speaker>
     <p>Oh , come , be fair !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Well , you must admit that , next day , every newspaper reader in Europe and America knew there were women in England in such dead earnest about the Suffrage that the men had stopped laughing at last , and turned them out of the House . Men even advertised how little they appreciated the fun by sending the women to gaol in pretty sober earnest . And all the world was talking about it .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MRS. HERIOT lays down the “ Church Times ” and joins the others .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>I have noticed , whenever the men are n't there , the women sit and discuss that scene . JEAN<stage>cheerfully</stage>I sha n't have to wait till the men are gone .<stage>Leans over LADY JOHN 'S shoulder and says half aside</stage>He 's in sympathy .</p>

    <stage>MR. FREDDY and LORD JOHN appear by the door they went out of . They stop to talk .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. F</speaker>
     <p>Here 's Freddy !<stage>Lower , hastily to MISS LEVERING .</stage>You 're judging from the outside . Those of us who have been working for years ... we all realise it was a perfectly lunatic proceeding . Why , think ! The only chance of our getting what we want is by winning over the men .<stage>Her watchful eye , leaving her husband for a moment , catches MISS LEVERING 'S little involuntary gesture .</stage>What 's the matter ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>“ Winning over the men ” has been the woman 's way for centuries . Do you think the result should make us proud of our policy ? Yes ? Then go and walk in Piccadilly at midnight .<stage>The older women glance at JEAN .</stage>No , I forgot ——</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>I forgot the magistrate 's ruling . He said no decent woman had any business to be in London 's main thoroughfare at night unless she has a man with her . I heard that in Nine Elms , too . “ You 're obliged to take up with a chap ! ” was what the woman said .</p>

     <p><stage>rising</stage>JEAN ! Come !<stage>She takes JEAN by her arm and draws her to the window , where she signals GREATOREX and FARNBOROUGH . MRS. FREDDY joins her husband and LORD JOHN .</stage>LADY JOHN<stage>kindly , aside to MISS LEVERING</stage>My dear , I think Lydia Heriot 's right . We ought n't to do anything or say anything to encourage this ferment of feminism , and I 'll tell you why : it 's likely to bring a very terrible thing in its train .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>What terrible thing ?</p>
    </sp>

There are a few decent artisans ; three or four “ beery ” out-o ’ - works ; three or four young women of the domestic servant or Strand restaurant cashier class ; one aged woman in rusty black peering with faded , wondering eyes , consulting the faces of the men and laughing nervously and apologetically from time to time ; one or two quiet-looking , business-like women , thirty to forty ; two middle-class men , who stare and whisper and smile . A quiet old man with a lot of unsold Sunday papers under one arm stands in an attitude of rapt attention , with the free hand round his deaf ear . A brisk-looking woman of forty-five or so , wearing pince-nez , goes round with a pile of propagandist literature on her arm . Many of the men smoking cigarettes — the old ones pipes . On the outskirts of this crowd , of several hundred , a couple of smart men in tall shining hats hover a few moments , single eyeglass up , and then saunter off . Against the middle of the Column , where it rises above the stone platform , is a great red banner , one supporting pole upheld by a grimy sandwichman , the other by a small , dirty boy of eight . If practicable only the lower portion of the banner need be seen , bearing the final words of the legend —</stage>
     <stage>“ VOTES FOR WOMEN ! ”</stage>
     <stage>in immense white letters . It will be well to get , to the full , the effect of the height above the crowd of the straggling group of speakers on the pedestal platform . These are , as the Curtain rises , a working-class woman who is waving her arms and talking very earnestly , her voice for the moment blurred in the uproar . She is dressed in brown serge and looks pinched and sallow . At her side is the CHAIRMAN urging that she be given a fair hearing . ALLEN TRENT is a tall , slim , brown-haired man of twenty-eight , with a slight stoop , an agreeable aspect , well-bred voice , and the gleaming brown eye of the visionary . Behind these two , looking on or talking among themselves , are several other carelessly dressed women ; one , better turned out than the rest , is quite young , very slight and gracefully built , with round , very pink cheeks , full , scarlet lips , naturally waving brown hair , and an air of childish gravity . She looks at the unruly mob with imperturbable calm . The CHAIRMAN 'S voice is drowned .</stage>
     <stage>WORKING WOMAN ( with lean , brown finger out and voice raised shriller now above the tumult ) . I 've got boys o ’ me own and we laugh at all sorts o ’ things , but I should be ashymed and so would they if ever they was to be'yve as you 're doin ’ to-d'y .</stage>

    </sp>
    <stage>Applause , chiefly ironic , laughter , a general moving closer and knitting up of attention . ERNESTINE BLUNT is about twenty-four , but looks younger . She is very downright , not to say pugnacious — the something amusing and attractive about her is there , as it were , against her will , and the more fetching for that . She has no conventional gestures , and none of any sort at first . As she warms to her work she uses her slim hands to enforce her emphasis , but as though unconsciously . Her manner of speech is less monotonous than that of the average woman-speaker , but she , too , has a fashion of leaning all her weight on the end of the sentence . She brings out the final word or two with an effort of underscoring , and makes a forward motion of the slim body as if the better to drive the last nail in . She evidently means to be immensely practical — the kind who is pleased to think she has n't a grain of sentimentality in her composition , and whose feeling , when it does all but master her , communicates itself magnetically to others .</stage>

We are sensitive . But I tell you , ridicule crumples a man up . It steels a woman . We 've come to know the value of ridicule . We 've educated ourselves so that we welcome ridicule .

     <p>And they say it would be dreadful if we got the vote , because then we 'd be pitted against men in the economic struggle . But that 's come about already . Do you know that out of every hundred women in this country eighty-two are wage-earning women ? It used to be thought unfeminine for women to be students and to aspire to the arts — that bring fame and fortune . But nobody has ever said it was unfeminine for women to do the heavy drudgery that 's badly paid . That kind of work had to be done by somebody — and the men did n't hanker after it . Oh , no .</p>

     <p>You 're told the case will be at two o'clock , and it 's really called for eleven . Well , I took a great deal of trouble , and I did n't believe what I was told —<stage>Warming a little to her task .</stage>Yes , that 's almost the first thing we have to learn — to get over our touching faith that , because a man tells us something , it 's true . I got to the right court , and I was so anxious not to be late , I was too early . The case before the Women 's was just coming on . I heard a noise . At the door I saw the helmets of two policemen , and I said to myself : “ What sort of crime shall I have to sit and hear about ? Is this a burglar coming along between the two big policemen , or will it be a murderer ? What sort of felon is to stand in the dock before the women whose crime is they ask for the vote ? ” But , try as I would , I could n't see the prisoner . My heart misgave me . Is it a woman , I wondered ? Then the policemen got nearer , and I saw —<stage>she waits an instant</stage>— a little , thin , half-starved boy . What do you think he was charged with ? Stealing . What had he been stealing — that small criminal ? Milk . It seemed to me as I sat there looking on , that the men who had the affairs of the world in their hands from the beginning , and who 've made so poor a business of it ——</p>

     <p>— so poor a business of it as to have the poor and the unemployed in the condition they 're in to-day — when your only remedy for a starving child is to hale him off to the police-court — because he had managed to get a little milk — well , I did wonder that the men refuse to be helped with a problem they 've so notoriously failed at .

     <p>I am not concerned that you should think we women can paint great pictures , or compose immortal music , or write good books . I am content that we should be classed with the common people — who keep the world going . But<stage>straightening up and taking a fresh start</stage>, I 'd like the world to go a great deal better . We were talking about justice . I have been inquiring into the kind of lodging the poorest class of homeless women can get in this town of London . I find that only the men of that class are provided for . Some measure to establish Rowton Houses for women has been before the London County Council . They looked into the question “ very carefully , ” so their apologists say . And what did they decide ? They decided that they could do nothing . LADY JOHN<stage>having forced her way to STONOR 'S side</stage>Is that true ? STONOR<stage>speaking through MISS LEVERING 'S next words</stage>I do n't know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Why could that great , all-powerful body do nothing ? Because , if these cheap and decent houses were opened , they said , the homeless women in the streets would make use of them ! You 'll think I 'm not in earnest . But that was actually the decision and the reason given for it . Women that the bitter struggle for existence has forced into a life of horror —— STONOR<stage>sternly to LADY JOHN</stage>You think this is the kind of thing ——<stage>A motion of the head towards JEAN .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>— the outcast women might take advantage of the shelter these decent , cheap places offered . But the men , I said ! Are all who avail themselves of Lord Rowton 's hostels , are they all angels ? Or does wrong-doing in a man not matter ? Yet women are recommended to depend on the chivalry of men .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The two policemen , who at first had been strolling about , have stood during this scene in front of GEOFFREY STONOR . They turn now and walk away , leaving STONOR exposed . He , embarrassed , moves uneasily , and VIDA LEVERING 'S eye falls upon his big figure . He still has the collar of his motor coat turned up to his ears . A change passes over her face , and her nerve fails her an instant .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Justice and chivalry ! !<stage>she steadies her voice and hurries on</stage>— they both remind me of what those of you who read the police-court news —<stage>I have begun only lately to do that</stage>— but you 've seen the accounts of the girl who 's been tried in Manchester lately for the murder of her child . Not pleasant reading . Even if we 'd noticed it , we would n't speak of it in my world . A few months ago I should have turned away my eyes and forgotten even the headline as quickly as I could . But since that morning in the police-court , I read these things . This , as you 'll remember , was about a little working girl — an orphan of eighteen — who crawled with the dead body of her new-born child to her master 's back-door , and left the baby there . She dragged herself a little way off and fainted . A few days later she found herself in court , being tried for the murder of her child . Her master — a married man — had of course reported the “ find ” at his back-door to the police , and he had been summoned to give evidence . The girl cried out to him in the open court , “ You are the father ! ” He could n't deny it . The Coroner at the jury 's request censured the man , and regretted that the law did n't make him responsible . But he went scot-free . And that girl is now serving her sentence in Strangeways Gaol .<stage>Murmuring and scraps of indistinguishable comment in the crowd , through which only JEAN 'S voice is clear .</stage>JEAN<stage>who has wormed her way to STONOR 'S side</stage>Why do you dislike her so ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>I ? Why should you think —— JEAN<stage>with a vaguely frightened air</stage>I never saw you look as you did — as you do .</p>

     <p><stage>signing to him “ It 's all right ”</stage>Men make boast that an English citizen is tried by his peers . What woman is tried by hers ?<stage>A sombre passion strengthens her voice and hurries her on .</stage>A woman is arrested by a man , brought before a man judge , tried by a jury of men , condemned by men , taken to prison by a man , and by a man she 's hanged ! Where in all this were her “ peers ” ? Why did men so long ago insist on trial by “ a jury of their peers ” ? So that justice should n't miscarry — was n't it ? A man 's peers would best understand his circumstances , his temptation , the degree of his guilt . Yet there 's no such unlikeness between different classes of men as exists between man and woman . What man has the knowledge that makes him a fit judge of woman 's deeds at that time of anguish — that hour —<stage>lowers her voice and bends over the crowd</stage>— that hour that some woman struggled through to put each man here into the world . I noticed when a previous speaker quoted the Labour Party you applauded . Some of you here — I gather — call yourselves Labour men . Every woman who has borne a child is a Labour woman . No man among you can judge what she goes through in her hour of darkness —— JEAN<stage>with frightened eyes on her lover 's set , white face , whispers</stage>Geoffrey ——</p>

     <p><stage>catching her fluttering breath , goes on very low .</stage>— in that great agony when , even under the best conditions that money and devotion can buy , many a woman falls into temporary mania , and not a few go down to death . In the case of this poor little abandoned working girl , what man can be the fit judge of her deeds in that awful moment of half-crazed temptation ? Women know of these things as those know burning who have walked through fire .<stage>STONOR makes a motion towards JEAN and she turns away fronting the audience . Her hands go up to her throat as though she suffered a choking sensation . It is in her face that she “ knows . ” MISS LEVERING leans over the platform and speaks with a low and thrilling earnestness .</stage>I would say in conclusion to the women here , it 's not enough to be sorry for these our unfortunate sisters . We must get the conditions of life made fairer . We women must organise . We must learn to work together . We have all<stage>rich and poor , happy and unhappy</stage>worked so long and so exclusively for men , we hardly know how to work for one another . But we must learn .

But the mass of men wo n't have it so . I only hope they 'll realise in time the good they 've renounced and the spirit they 've aroused . For I know as well as any man could tell me , it would be a bad day for England if all women felt about all men as I do .<stage>She retires in a tumult . The others on the platform close about her .

    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>Why are you so sure of that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>Because she did n't so much as hint such a thing when she wrote that she meant to break off the — the ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>What made her write like that ? STONOR<stage>with suppressed rage</stage>Why will you go on talking of what 's so long over and ended ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>What reason did she give ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>If your curiosity has so got the upper hand — ask her . JEAN<stage>her eyes upon him</stage>You 're afraid to tell me . STONOR<stage>putting pressure on himself to answer quietly</stage>I still hoped — at that time — to win my father over . She blamed me because<stage>goes to window and looks blindly out and speaks in a low tone</stage>if the child had lived it would n't have been possible to get my father to — to overlook it . JEAN<stage>faintly</stage>You wanted it overlooked ? I do n't underst —— STONOR<stage>turning passionately back to her</stage>Of course you do n't .<stage>He seizes her hand and tries to draw her to him .</stage>If you did , you would n't be the beautiful , tender , innocent child you are —— JEAN<stage>has withdrawn her hand and shrunk from him with an impulse — slight as is its expression — so tragically eloquent , that fear for the first time catches hold of him</stage>I am glad you did n't mean to desert her , Geoffrey . It was n't your fault after all — only some misunderstanding that can be cleared up .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>Cleared up ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>Yes . Cleared up . STONOR<stage>aghast</stage>You are n't thinking that this miserable old affair I 'd as good as forgotten —— JEAN<stage>in a horror-struck whisper , with a glance at the door which he does n't see</stage>Forgotten !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>No , no . I do n't mean exactly forgotten . But you 're torturing me so I do n't know what I 'm saying .<stage>He goes closer .</stage>You are n't — Jean ! you — you are n't going to let it come between you and me ! JEAN<stage>presses her handkerchief to her lips , and then , taking it away , answers steadily</stage>I can n't make or unmake what 's past . But I 'm glad , at least , that you did n't mean to desert her in her trouble . You 'll remind her of that first of all , wo n't you ?<stage>Moves to the door , L .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>Where are you going ?<stage>Raising his voice .</stage>Why should I remind anybody of what I want only to forget ? JEAN<stage>finger on lip</stage>Sh ! STONOR<stage>with eyes on the door</stage>You do n't mean that she 's ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>Yes . I left her to get a little rest .<stage>He recoils in an access of uncontrollable rage . She follows him . Speechless , he goes down R. to get his hat .</stage>Geoffrey , do n't go before you hear me . I do n't know if what I think matters to you now — but I hope it does .<stage>With tears .</stage>You can still make me think of you without shrinking — if you will . STONOR<stage>fixes her a moment with his eyes . Then sternly</stage>What is it you are asking of me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>To make amends , Geoffrey . STONOR<stage>with an outburst</stage>You poor little innocent !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>I 'm poor enough . But<stage>locking her hands together</stage>I 'm not so innocent but what I know you must right that old wrong now , if you 're ever to right it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>You are n't insane enough to think I would turn round in these few hours and go back to something that ten years ago was ended for ever ! Why , it 's stark , staring madness !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>No .<stage>Catching on his arm .</stage>What you did ten years ago — that was mad . This is paying a debt .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>Look here , Jean , you 're dreadfully wrought up and excited — tired too ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>No , not tired — though I 've travelled so far to-day . I know you smile at sudden conversions . You think they 're hysterical — worse — vulgar . But people must get their revelation how they can . And , Geoffrey , if I can n't make you see this one of mine — I shall know your love could never mean strength to me . Only weakness . And I shall be afraid . So afraid I 'll never dare to give you the chance of making me loathe myself . I shall never see you again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>How right I was to be afraid of that vein of fanaticism in you .<stage>Moves towards the door .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>Certainly you could n't make a greater mistake than to go away now and think it any good ever to come back .<stage>He turns .</stage>Even if I came to feel different , I could n't do anything different . I should know all this could n't be forgotten . I should know that it would poison my life in the end . Yours too . STONOR<stage>with suppressed fury</stage>She has made good use of her time !<stage>With a sudden thought .</stage>What has changed her ? Has she been seeing visions too ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>What do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>Why is she intriguing to get hold of a man that , ten years ago , she flatly refused to see , or hold any communication with ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>“ Intriguing to get hold of ? ” She has n't mentioned you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>What ! Then how in the name of Heaven do you know — that she wants — what you ask ? JEAN<stage>firmly</stage>There can n't be any doubt about that . STONOR<stage>with immense relief</stage>You absurd , ridiculous child ! Then all this is just your own unaided invention . Well — I could thank God !<stage>Falls into the nearest chair and passes his handkerchief over his face .</stage>JEAN<stage>perplexed , uneasy</stage>For what are you thanking God ? STONOR<stage>trying to think out his plan of action</stage>Suppose —<stage>I 'm not going to risk it</stage>— but suppose —<stage>He looks up and at the sight of JEAN 'S face a new tenderness comes into his own . He rises suddenly .</stage>Whether I deserve to suffer or not — it 's quite certain you do n't . Do n't cry , dear one . It never was the real thing . I had to wait till I knew you before I understood . JEAN<stage>lifts her eyes brimming</stage>Oh , is that true ?<stage>Checks her movement towards him .</stage>Loving you has made things clear to me I did n't dream of before . If I could think that because of me you were able to do this —— STONOR<stage>seizes her by the shoulders and says hoarsely</stage>Look here ! Do you seriously ask me to give up the girl I love — to go and offer to marry a woman that even to think of ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>
     <p>You cared for her once . You 'll care about her again . She is beautiful and brilliant — everything . I 've heard she could win any man she set herself to —— STONOR<stage>pushing JEAN from him</stage>She 's bewitched you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEAN</speaker>

     <p>All the same — I 'll go down and give the order . JEAN<stage>stopping quite still on a sudden</stage>Very well .<stage>Sits C .</stage>You 'll come back if you 're the man I pray you are .<stage>Breaks into a flood of silent tears , her elbows on the table ( C .</stage>her face in her hands . ) STONOR<stage>returns , bends over her , about to take her in his arms</stage>Dearest of all the world ——</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Door L. opens softly and VIDA LEVERING appears . She is arrested at sight of STONOR , and is in the act of drawing back when , upon the slight noise , STONOR looks round . His face darkens , he stands staring at her and then with a look of speechless anger goes silently out C. JEAN , hearing him shut the door , drops her head on the table with a sob . VIDA LEVERING crosses slowly to her and stands a moment silent at the girl 's side .</stage>

     <p><stage>quickly</stage>Who tells you that ?</p>

     <p>Several people have told me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Well , you should be very careful how you believe what you hear . JEAN<stage>passionately</stage>You know it 's true .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>I know that it 's possible to be mistaken .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>I see ! You 're trying to shield him ——</p>

VIDA LEVERING relinquishes an impulse to follow , and sits left centre . JEAN comes slowly back with her eyes bent on the floor , does not lift them till she is quite near VIDA .

     <p>Yes , he ——</p>

     <p>What ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>

     <p>In our debt ?</p>
    </sp>

     <p><stage>sternly</stage>No , he can n't repay the dead . But there are the living . There are the thousands with hope still in their hearts and youth in their blood . Let him help them . Let him be a Friend to Women . JEAN<stage>rising on a wave of enthusiasm</stage>Yes , yes — I understand . That too !<stage>The door opens . As STONOR enters with LADY JOHN , he makes a slight gesture towards the two as much as to say , “ You see . ”</stage>JEAN<stage>catching sight of him</stage>Thank you ! LADY JOHN<stage>in a clear , commonplace tone to JEAN</stage>Well , you rather gave us the slip . Vida , I believe Mr. Stonor wants to see you for a few minutes<stage>glances at watch</stage>— but I 'd like a word with you first , as I must get back .<stage>To STONOR .</stage>Do you think the car — your man said something about re-charging .

     <p>Yes , I am aware of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>But it is n't with your sanction , surely , that she goes on making this extraordinary demand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p><stage>slowly</stage>I did n't sanction it at first , but I 've been thinking it over .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>Then all I can say is I am greatly disappointed in you . You threw this man over years ago for reasons — whatever they were — that seemed to you good and sufficient . And now you come between him and a younger woman — just to play Nemesis , so far as I can make out !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Is that what he says ?</p>
    </sp>

     <p>He says nothing that is n't fair and considerate .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>I can see he 's changed .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>And you 're unchanged — is that it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>I 've changed even more than he .</p>

     <p>But<stage>pity and annoyance blended in her tone</stage>— you care about him still , Vida ?</p>

     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>I see . It 's just that you wish to marry somebody ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Lady John , there are no men listening . LADY JOHN<stage>surprised</stage>No , I did n't suppose there were .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Then why keep up that old pretence ?</p>

     <p>What pre ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>That to marry at all costs is every woman 's dearest ambition till the grave closes over her . You and I know it is n't true .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>Well , but —— Oh ! it was just the unexpected sight of him bringing it back —— That was what fired you this afternoon !<stage>With an honest attempt at sympathetic understanding .</stage>Of course . The memory of a thing like that can never die — can never even be dimmed — for the woman .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>I mean her to think so . LADY JOHN<stage>bewildered</stage>Jean !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MISS LEVERING nods .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>And it is n't so ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>You do n't seriously believe a woman with anything else to think about , comes to the end of ten years still absorbed in a memory of that sort ? LADY JOHN<stage>astonished</stage>You 've got over it , then !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>If the newspapers did n't remind me I should n't remember once a twelvemonth that there was ever such a person as Geoffrey Stonor in the world . LADY JOHN<stage>with unconscious rapture</stage>Oh , I 'm so glad !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p><stage>smiles grimly</stage>Yes , I 'm glad too .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>And if Geoffrey Stonor offered you — what 's called “ reparation ” — you 'd refuse it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p><stage>smiles a little contemptuously</stage>Geoffrey Stonor ! For me he 's simply one of the far-back links in a chain of evidence . It 's certain I think a hundred times of other women 's present unhappiness , to once that I remember that old unhappiness of mine that 's past . I think of the nail and chain makers of Cradley Heath . The sweated girls of the slums . I think of the army of ill-used women whose very existence I must n't mention —— LADY JOHN<stage>interrupting hurriedly</stage>Then why in Heaven 's name do you let poor Jean imagine ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p><stage>bending forward</stage>Look — I 'll trust you , Lady John . I do n't suffer from that old wrong as Jean thinks I do , but I shall coin her sympathy into gold for a greater cause than mine .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>I do n't understand you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Jean is n't old enough to be able to care as much about a principle as about a person . But if my half-forgotten pain can turn her generosity into the common treasury ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>What do you propose she shall do , poor child ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Use her hold over Geoffrey Stonor to make him help us !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>Help you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>The man who served one woman — God knows how many more — very ill , shall serve hundreds of thousands well . Geoffrey Stonor shall make it harder for his son , harder still for his grandson , to treat any woman as he treated me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>How will he do that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>By putting an end to the helplessness of women . LADY JOHN<stage>ironically</stage>You must think he has a great deal of power ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Power ? Yes , men have too much over penniless and frightened women . LADY JOHN<stage>impatiently</stage>What nonsense ! You talk as though the women had n't their share of human nature . We are n't made of ice any more than the men .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>No , but all the same we have more self-control .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>Than men ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>You know we have . LADY JOHN<stage>shrewdly</stage>I know we must n't admit it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>For fear they 'd call us fishes ! LADY JOHN<stage>evasively</stage>They talk of our lack of self-control — but it 's the last thing they want women to have .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Oh , we know what they want us to have . So we make shift to have it . If we do n't , we go without hope — sometimes we go without bread . LADY JOHN<stage>shocked</stage>Vida — do you mean to say that you ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>I mean to say that men 's vanity wo n't let them see it , but the thing 's largely a question of economics . LADY JOHN<stage>shocked</stage>You never loved him , then !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Oh , yes , I loved him — once . It was my helplessness turned the best thing life can bring , into a curse for both of us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>I do n't understand you ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Oh , being “ understood ! ” — that 's too much to expect . When people come to know I 've joined the Union ——</p>

     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>But you wo n't ——</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>— who is there who will resist the temptation to say , “ Poor Vida Levering ! What a pity she has n't got a husband and a baby to keep her quiet ” ? The few who know about me , they 'll be equally sure that it 's not the larger view of life I 've gained — my own poor little story is responsible for my new departure .<stage>Leans forward and looks into LADY JOHN 'S face .</stage>My best friend , she will be surest of all , that it 's a private sense of loss , or , lower yet , a grudge ——! But I tell you the only difference between me and thousands of women with husbands and babies is that I 'm free to say what I think . They are n't . LADY JOHN<stage>rising and looking at her watch</stage>I must get back — my poor ill-used guests .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p><stage>rising</stage>I wo n't ring . I think you 'll find Mr. Stonor downstairs waiting for you . LADY JOHN<stage>embarrassed</stage>Oh — a — he will have left word about the car in any case .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MISS LEVERING has opened the door ( C .) . ALLEN TRENT is in the act of saying goodbye to JEAN in the hall .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Well , Mr. Trent , I did n't expect to see you this evening . TRENT<stage>comes and stands in the doorway</stage>Why not ? Have I ever failed ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Lady John , this is one of our allies . He is good enough to squire me through the rabble from time to time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>Well , I think it 's very handsome of you , after what she said to-day about men .<stage>Shakes hands .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TRENT</speaker>
     <p>I 've no great opinion of most men myself . I might add — or of most women .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Oh ! Well , at any rate I shall go away relieved to think that</l>
      <l>Miss Levering 's plain speaking has n't alienated all masculine regard .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TRENT</speaker>
     <p>Why should it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>That 's right , Mr. Trent ! Do n't believe all she says in the heat of propaganda .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TRENT</speaker>
     <p>I do believe all she says . But I 'm not cast down . LADY JOHN<stage>smiling</stage>Not when she says —— TRENT<stage>interrupting</stage>Was there never a mysogynist of my sex who ended by deciding to make an exception ? LADY JOHN<stage>smiling significantly</stage>Oh , if that 's what you build on !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TRENT</speaker>
     <p>Well , why should n't a man-hater on your side prove equally open to reason ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>That part of the question does n't concern me . I 've come to a place where I realise that the first battles of this new campaign must be fought by women alone . The only effective help men could give — amendment of the law — they refuse . The rest is nothing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>Do n't be ungrateful , Vida . Here 's Mr. Trent ready to face criticism in publicly championing you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>It 's an illusion that I as an individual need Mr. Trent . I am quite safe in the crowd . Please do n't wait for me , and do n't come for me again . TRENT<stage>flushes</stage>Of course if you 'd rather ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>And that reminds me . I was asked to thank you and to tell you , too , that they — the women of the Union — they wo n't need your chairmanship any more — though that , I beg you to believe , has nothing to do with any feeling of mine . TRENT<stage>hurt</stage>Of course , I know there must be other men ready — better known men ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>It is n't that . It 's simply that they find a man can n't keep a rowdy meeting in order as well as a woman .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He stares .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>You are n't serious ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p><stage>to TRENT</stage>Have n't you noticed that all their worst disturbances come when men are in charge ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TRENT</speaker>
     <p>Well — a —<stage>laughs a little ruefully as he moves to the door</stage>I had n't connected the two ideas . Goodbye .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Goodbye .</l>
      <stage>JEAN takes him downstairs , right centre .</stage>
      <l>LADY JOHN</l>
      <stage>as TRENT disappears</stage>
      <l>That nice boy 's in love with you .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <stage>MISS LEVERING simply looks at her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>Goodbye .<stage>They shake hands .</stage>I wish you had n't been so unkind to that nice boy !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Do you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY JOHN</speaker>
     <p>Yes , for then I would be more certain of your telling Geoffrey Stonor that intelligent women do n't nurse their wrongs and lie in wait to punish them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>You are not certain ? LADY JOHN<stage>goes close up to VIDA</stage>Are you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>VIDA stands with her eyes on the ground , silent , motionless . LADY JOHN , with a nervous glance at her watch and a gesture of extreme perturbation , goes hurriedly out . VIDA shuts the door . She comes slowly back , sits down and covers her face with her hands . She rises and begins to walk up and down , obviously trying to master her agitation . Enter GEOFFREY STONOR .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Well , have they primed you ? Have you got your lesson<stage>with a little broken laugh</stage>by heart at last ? STONOR<stage>looking at her from immeasurable distance</stage>I am not sure I understand you .<stage>Pause .</stage>However unpropitious your mood may be — I shall discharge my errand .<stage>Pause . Her silence irritates him .</stage>I have promised to offer you what I believe is called “ amends . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p><stage>quickly</stage>You 've come to realise , then — after all these years — that you owed me something ? STONOR<stage>on the brink of protest , checks himself</stage>I am not here to deny it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p><stage>fiercely</stage>Pay , then — pay . STONOR<stage>a moment 's dread as he looks at her , his lips set . Then stonily</stage>I have promised that , if you exact it , I will .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Ah ! If I insist you 'll “ make it all good ” !<stage>Quite low .</stage>Then do n't you know you must pay me in kind ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>What do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Give me back what you took from me : my old faith . Give me that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>Oh , if you mean to make phrases ——<stage>A gesture of scant patience .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p><stage>going closer</stage>Or give me back mere kindness — or even tolerance . Oh , I do n't mean your tolerance ! Give me back the power to think fairly of my brothers — not as mockers — thieves .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>I have not mocked you . And I have asked you ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Something you knew I should refuse ! Or<stage>her eyes blaze</stage>did you dare to be afraid I would n't ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>I suppose , if we set our teeth , we could ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>I could n't — not even if I set my teeth . And you would n't dream of asking me , if you thought there was the smallest chance .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>I can do no more than make you an offer of such reparation as is in my power . If you do n't accept it ——<stage>He turns with an air of “ That 's done . ”</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Accept it ? No !... Go away and live in debt ! Pay and pay and pay — and find yourself still in debt !— for a thing you 'll never be able to give me back .<stage>Lower .</stage>And when you come to die , say to yourself , “ I paid all creditors but one . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>I 'm rather tired , you know , of this talk of debt . If I hear that you persist in it I shall have to ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>What ?<stage>She faces him .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>No . I 'll keep to my resolution .<stage>Turning to the door .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p><stage>intercepting him</stage>What resolution ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>I came here , under considerable pressure , to speak of the future — not to re-open the past .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>The Future and the Past are one .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>You talk as if that old madness was mine alone . It is the woman 's way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>I know . And it 's not fair . Men suffer as well as we by the woman 's starting wrong . We are taught to think the man a sort of demigod . If he tells her : “ go down into Hell ” — down into Hell she goes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>Make no mistake . Not the woman alone . They go down together .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Yes , they go down together , but the man comes up alone . As a rule . It is more convenient so — for him . And for the Other Woman .<stage>The eyes of both go to JEAN 'S door .</stage>STONOR<stage>angrily</stage>My conscience is clear . I know — and so do you — that most men in my position would n't have troubled themselves . I gave myself endless trouble .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p><stage>with wondering eyes</stage>So you 've gone about all these years feeling that you 'd discharged every obligation .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>Not only that . I stood by you with a fidelity that was nothing short of Quixotic . If , woman like , you must recall the Past — I insist on your recalling it correctly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p><stage>very low</stage>You think I do n't recall it correctly ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>Not when you make — other people believe that I deserted you .<stage>With gathering wrath .</stage>It 's a curious enough charge when you stop to consider ——<stage>Checks himself , and with a gesture of impatience sweeps the whole thing out of his way .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Well , when we do — just for five minutes out of ten years — when we do stop to consider ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>We remember it was you who did the deserting ! Since you had to rake the story up , you might have had the fairness to tell the facts .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>You think “ the facts ” would have excused you !<stage>She sits .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>No doubt you 've forgotten them , since Lady John tells me you would n't remember my existence once a year if the newspapers did n't ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Ah , you minded that ! STONOR<stage>with manly spirit</stage>I minded your giving false impressions .<stage>She is about to speak , he advances on her .</stage>Do you deny that you returned my letters unopened ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p><stage>quietly</stage>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>Do you deny that you refused to see me — and that , when I persisted , you vanished ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>I do n't deny any of those things .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>Why , I had no trace of you for years !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>I suppose not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>Very well , then . What could I do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Nothing . It was too late to do anything .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>It was n't too late ! You knew — since you “ read the papers ” — that my father died that same year . There was no longer any barrier between us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Oh yes , there was a barrier .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>Of your own making , then .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>I had my guilty share in it — but the barrier<stage>her voice trembles</stage>— the barrier was your invention .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>It was no “ invention . ” If you had ever known my father ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Oh , the echoes ! The echoes ! How often you used to say , if I “ knew your father ! ” But you said , too<stage>lower</stage>— you called the greatest barrier by another name .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>What name ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p><stage>very low</stage>The child that was to come . STONOR<stage>hastily</stage>That was before my father died . While I still hoped to get his consent .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p><stage>nods</stage>How the thought of that all-powerful personage used to terrorise me ! What chance had a little unborn child against “ the last of the great feudal lords , ” as you called him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>You know the child would have stood between you and me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>I know the child did stand between you and me ! STONOR<stage>with vague uneasiness</stage>It did stand ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Happy mothers teach their children . Mine had to teach me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>You talk as if ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>— teach me that a woman may do a thing for love 's sake that shall kill love .<stage>A silence .</stage>STONOR<stage>fearing and putting from him fuller comprehension , rises with an air of finality</stage>You certainly made it plain you had no love left for me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>I had need of it all for the child . STONOR<stage>stares — comes closer , speaks hurriedly and very low</stage>Do you mean then that , after all — it lived ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>No ; I mean that it was sacrificed . But it showed me no barrier is so impassable as the one a little child can raise . STONOR<stage>a light dawning</stage>Was that why you ... was that why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p><stage>nods , speechless a moment</stage>Day and night there it was !— between my thought of you and me .<stage>He sits again , staring at her .</stage>When I was most unhappy I would wake , thinking I heard it cry . It was my own crying I heard , but I seemed to have it in my arms . I suppose I was mad . I used to lie there in that lonely farmhouse pretending to hush it . It was so I hushed myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>I never knew ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>I did n't blame you . You could n't risk being with me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>You agreed that for both our sakes ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Yes , you had to be very circumspect . You were so well known . Your autocratic father — your brilliant political future ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>Be fair . Our future — as I saw it then .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Yes , it all hung on concealment . It must have looked quite simple to you . You did n't know that the ghost of a child that had never seen the light , the frail thing you meant to sweep aside and forget — have swept aside and forgotten — you did n't know it was strong enough to push you out of my life .<stage>Lower with an added intensity .</stage>It can do more .<stage>Leans over him and whispers .</stage>It can push that girl out .<stage>STONOR 'S face changes .</stage>It can do more still .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>Are you threatening me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>No , I am preparing you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>For what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>For the work that must be done . Either with your help — or that girl 's .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>STONOR lifts his eyes a moment .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>One of two things . Either her life , and all she has , given to this new service — or a Ransom , if I give her up to you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>I see . A price . Well ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p><stage>looks searchingly in his face , hesitates and shakes her head</stage>Even if I could trust you to pay — no , it would be a poor bargain to give her up for anything you could do . STONOR<stage>rising</stage>In spite of your assumption — she may not be your tool .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>You are horribly afraid she is ! But you are wrong . Do n't think it 's merely I that have got hold of Jean Dunbarton . STONOR<stage>angrily</stage>Who else ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>The New Spirit that 's abroad .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>STONOR turns away with an exclamation and begins to pace , sentinel-like , up and down before JEAN 'S door .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>How else should that inexperienced girl have felt the new loyalty and responded as she did ? STONOR<stage>under his breath</stage>“ New ” indeed — however little loyal .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Loyal above all . But no newer than electricity was when it first lit up the world . It had been there since the world began — waiting to do away with the dark . So has the thing you 're fighting . STONOR<stage>his voice held down to its lowest register</stage>The thing I 'm fighting is nothing more than one person 's hold on a highly sensitive imagination . I consented to this interview with the hope ——<stage>A gesture of impotence .</stage>It only remains for me to show her your true motive is revenge .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Once say that to her and you are lost !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>STONOR motionless ; his look is the look of a man who sees happiness slipping away .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>I know what it is that men fear . It even seems as if it must be through fear that your enlightenment will come . That is why I see a value in Jean Dunbarton far beyond her fortune .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>STONOR lifts his eyes dully and fixes them on VIDA 'S face .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>More than any girl I know — if I keep her from you — that gentle , inflexible creature could rouse in men the old half-superstitious fear ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>“ Fear ? ” I believe you are mad .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>“ Mad . ” “ Unsexed . ” These are the words to-day . In the Middle Ages men cried out “ Witch ! ” and burnt her — the woman who served no man 's bed or board .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>You want to make that poor child believe ——</p>
    </sp>

     <p>She sees for herself we 've come to a place where we find there 's a value in women apart from the value men see in them . You teach us not to look to you for some of the things we need most . If women must be freed by women , we have need of such as —<stage>her eyes go to JEAN 'S door</stage>— who knows ? She may be the new Joan of Arc . STONOR<stage>aghast</stage>That she should be the sacrifice !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>You have taught us to look very calmly on the sacrifice of women . Men tell us in every tongue it 's “ a necessary evil . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>STONOR stands rooted , staring at the ground .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>One girl 's happiness — against a thing nobler than happiness for thousands — who can hesitate ?— Not Jean .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>Good God ! Ca n't you see that this crazed campaign you 'd start her on — even if it 's successful , it can only be so through the help of men ? What excuse shall you make your own soul for not going straight to the goal ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>You think we would n't be glad to go straight to the goal ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>I do . I see you 'd much rather punish me and see her revel in a morbid self-sacrifice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>You say I want to punish you only because , like most men , you wo n't take the trouble to understand what we do want — or how determined we are to have it . You can n't kill this new spirit among women .<stage>Going nearer .</stage>And you could n't make a greater mistake than to think it finds a home only in the exceptional , or the unhappy . It 's so strange , Geoffrey , to see a man like you as much deluded as the Hyde Park loafers who say to Ernestine Blunt , “ Who 's hurt your feelings ? ” Why not realise<stage>going quite close to him</stage>this is a thing that goes deeper than personal experience ? And yet<stage>lowering her voice and glancing at the door</stage>, if you take only the narrowest personal view , a good deal depends on what you and I agree upon in the next five minutes . STONOR<stage>bringing her farther away from the door</stage>You recommend my realising the larger issues . But in your ambition to attach that girl to the chariot wheels of “ Progress , ” you quite ignore the fact that people fitter for such work — the men you look to enlist in the end — are ready waiting to give the thing a chance .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Men are ready ! What men ? STONOR<stage>avoiding her eyes , picking his words</stage>Women have themselves to blame that the question has grown so delicate that responsible people shrink — for the moment — from being implicated in it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>We have seen the “ shrinking . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>Without quoting any one else , I might point out that the New Antagonism seems to have blinded you to the small fact that I , for one , am not an opponent .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>The phrase has a familiar ring . We have heard it from four hundred and twenty others .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>I spoke , if I may say so , of some one who would count . Some one who can carry his party along with him — or risk a seat in the Cabinet .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p><stage>quickly</stage>Did you mean you are ready to do that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>An hour ago I was .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Ah !... an hour ago .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>Exactly . You do n't understand men . They can be led . They can n't be driven . Ten minutes before you came into the room I was ready to say I would throw in my political lot with this Reform .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>And now ...?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>Now you block my way by an attempt at coercion . By forcing my hand you give my adherence an air of bargain-driving for a personal end . Exactly the mistake of the ignorant agitators of your “ Union , ” as you call it . You have a great deal to learn . This movement will go forward , not because of the agitation , but in spite of it . There are men in Parliament who would have been actively serving the Reform to-day ... as actively as so vast a constitutional change ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p><stage>smiles faintly</stage>And they have n't done it because ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>Because it would have put a premium on breaches of decent behaviour .<stage>He takes a crumpled piece of paper out of his pocket .</stage>Look here !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p><stage>flushes with excitement as she reads the telegram</stage>This is very good . I see only one objection .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>Objection !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>You have n't sent it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>That is your fault .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>When did you write this ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>Just before you came in — when ——<stage>He glances at the door .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Ah ! It must have pleased Jean — that message .<stage>Offers him back the paper .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <stage>STONOR astonished at her yielding it up so lightly , and remembering JEAN had not so much as read it . He throws himself heavily into a chair and drops his head in his hands .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>I could drive a hard-and-fast bargain with you , but I think I wo n't . If both love and ambition urge you on , perhaps ——<stage>She gazes at the slack , hopeless figure with its sudden look of age — goes over silently and stands by his side .</stage>After all , life has n't been quite fair to you ——<stage>He raises his heavy eyes .</stage>You fall out of one ardent woman 's dreams into another 's .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>You may as well tell me — do you mean to ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>To keep you and her apart ? No . STONOR<stage>for the first time tears come into his eyes . After a moment he holds out his hand</stage>What can I do for you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MISS LEVERING shakes her head — speechless .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>For the real you . Not the Reformer , or the would-be politician — for the woman I so unwillingly hurt .<stage>As she turns away , struggling with her feeling , he lays a detaining hand on her arm .</stage>You may not believe it , but now that I understand , there is almost nothing I would n't do to right that old wrong .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>There 's nothing to be done . You can never give me back my child . STONOR<stage>at the anguish in VIDA 'S face his own has changed</stage>Will that ghost give you no rest ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Yes , oh , yes . I see life is nobler than I knew . There is work to do . STONOR<stage>stopping her as she goes towards the folding doors</stage>Why should you think that it 's only you , these ten years have taught something to ? Why not give even a man credit for a willingness to learn something of life , and for being sorry — profoundly sorry — for the pain his instruction has cost others ? You seem to think I 've taken it all quite lightly . That 's not fair . All my life , ever since you disappeared , the thought of you has hurt . I would give anything I possess to know you — were happy again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>Oh , happiness ! STONOR<stage>significantly</stage>Why should n't you find it still .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p><stage>stares an instant</stage>I see ! She could n't help telling about Allen Trent — Lady John could n't .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>You 're one of the people the years have not taken from , but given more to . You are more than ever .... You have n't lost your beauty .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>The gods saw it was so little effectual , it was n't worth taking away .<stage>She stands looking out into the void .</stage>One woman 's mishap ?— what is that ? A thing as trivial to the great world as it 's sordid in most eyes . But the time has come when a woman may look about her , and say , “ What general significance has my secret pain ? Does it ‘ join on ’ to anything ? ” And I find it does . I 'm no longer merely a woman who has stumbled on the way . I 'm one<stage>she controls with difficulty the shake in her voice</stage>who has got up bruised and bleeding , wiped the dust from her hands and the tears from her face , and said to herself not merely , “ Here 's one luckless woman ! but — here is a stone of stumbling to many . Let 's see if it can n't be moved out of other women 's way . ” And she calls people to come and help . No mortal man , let alone a woman , by herself , can move that rock of offence . But<stage>with a sudden sombre flame of enthusiasm</stage>if many help , Geoffrey , the thing can be done . STONOR<stage>looks at her with wondering pity</stage>Lord ! how you care !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p><stage>touched by his moved face</stage>Do n't be so sad . Shall I tell you a secret ? Jean 's ardent dreams need n't frighten you , if she has a child . That — from the beginning , it was not the strong arm — it was the weakest — the little , little arms that subdued the fiercest of us .<stage>STONOR puts out a pitying hand uncertainly towards her . She does not take it , but speaks with great gentleness .</stage>You will have other children , Geoffrey — for me there was to be only one . Well , well —<stage>she brushes her tears away</stage>— since men alone have tried and failed to make a decent world for the little children to live in — it 's as well some of us are childless .<stage>Quietly taking up her hat and cloak .</stage>Yes , we are the ones who have no excuse for standing aloof from the fight .</p>

     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>Vida !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS L</speaker>
     <p>What ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STONOR</speaker>
     <p>You 've forgotten something .<stage>As she looks back he is signing the message .</stage>This .<stage>She goes out silently with the “ political dynamite ” in her hand .</stage>CURTAIN .
