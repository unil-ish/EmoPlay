   <performance>These plays , with one exception , were written in Greenwich Village , and , with another exception , first performed there — some at the old Liberal Club , and others by the Provincetown Players . They are souvenirs of an intellectual play-time which , being dead , deserves some not-too-solemn memorial . F. D .</performance>

      <head>A VERY SHORT MORALITY PLAY</head>
      <head>TO ARTHUR DAVISON FICKE</head>
      <stage>This is a much changed version of “ A Five Minute Problem Play , ” originally given at the Liberal Club , New York City , in 1913 .</stage>
      <stage>Boundless blue space . Two celestial figures stand in front of it , talking . One of them carries a pointer , such as is used in class-room demonstrations at the blackboard . The other has a red-covered guidebook under his arm .</stage>
      <stage>THE FIRST CELESTIAL FIGURE ( the one with the pointer ) Well , I think that is all . You 've seen everything now .</stage>
      <stage>THE SECOND CELESTIAL FIGURE ( the One With the guidebook ) It has all been very interesting , and I do n't know how to thank you for the trouble you 've taken .</stage>
     </stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FIRST CELESTIAL FIGURE</speaker>
      <p>Do n't mention it . That 's my business , you know — to show young and curious Spirits what there is to see in the universe . And I must say that you 've been an exceptionally patient pupil . I do n't usually take as much time with youngsters as I have with you . But when I find someone as interested in the universe as you are , I do n't mind spending a few more eons on the job . We 've been all around , this trip . I do n't believe we 've missed anything of any importance . But if there is anything else you can think of that you 'd like to see —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE SECOND CELESTIAL FIGURE</speaker>
      <p><stage>hesitantly</stage>Well , there is one place . . . It 's only mentioned in a footnote in the guide-book , but for that very reason I thought perhaps —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FIRST CELESTIAL FIGURE</speaker>
      <p>You have the right attitude . There 's nothing too small or insignificant to know about . Do you remember the name of the place ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE SECOND CELESTIAL FIGURE</speaker>
      <p>No , but —<stage>He turns the leaves of the guide-book .</stage>Here it is .<stage>He holds the book closer so as to read the fine print at the bottom of the page .</stage>Earth , it 's called .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FIRST CELESTIAL FIGURE</speaker>
      <p>Ah , yes , there is such a place . . . .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE SECOND CELESTIAL FIGURE</speaker>
      <p>The guide-book does n't give any information about it . Just mentions its name .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FIRST CELESTIAL FIGURE</speaker>
      <p>Well , there is n't very much to say about it . After what you 've seen , you would n't be impressed by its art or its architecture , . . . Still , it has one curious feature that perhaps you 'd be interested in . It 's — He pauses .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE SECOND CELESTIAL FIGURE</speaker>
      <p>Yes ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FIRST CELESTIAL FIGURE</speaker>
      <p>Perhaps I had better just show you , and let you make what you can of it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE SECOND CELESTIAL FIGURE</speaker>
      <p><stage>deferentially</stage>As you say .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FIRST CELESTIAL FIGURE</speaker>
      <p>Here , then — look for yourself ! He raises the pointer , and boundless space rolls up like a curtain , disclosing a comfortable drawing-room . The two celestial figures stand aside and look . A man and woman are sitting on a sofa , kissing each other . From time to time , in intervals between the kisses , they speak .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAN</speaker>
      <p>No ! No ! I must not ! But he does .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE WOMAN</speaker>
      <p>No ! No ! We must not ! But they do .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAN</speaker>
      <p>We must not — The second celestial figure turns to look inquiringly at the first , and boundless space falls like a blue curtain between them and the scene .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE SECOND CELESTIAL FIGURE</speaker>
      <p>It is strange . I 've seen nothing like that anywhere in the universe . But why do you suppose —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FIRST CELESTIAL FIGURE</speaker>
      <p>Oh , as to that , I really cannot say . It 's what is called “ Human nature . ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE SECOND CELESTIAL FIGURE</speaker>
      <p>Oh ! They walk off thoughtfully .</p>

      <docTitle><titlePart>THE CHASTE ADVENTURES OF JOSEPH A COMEDY</titlePart></docTitle>
      <docImprint>“ The Chaste Adventures of Joseph ” was first produced at the Liberal Club ,<settlement>New York</settlement>City , in<date>1914</date>, with the following cast :</docImprint>
      <docTitle><titlePart>Madam Potiphar ....... Louise Murphy Asenath .............. Marjorie Jones Potiphar ............. Berkeley Tobey Joseph ............... Floyd Dell Slave ................ Maurice Becker A room in Potiphar 's house . It is sparingly furnished with a table , two stools , and a couch , all in the simpler style of the early dynasties .... The table , which is set at an angle , is piled with papyri , and one papyrus is half-unrolled and held open by paper-weights where somebody has been reading it .... There is a small window in one wall , opening on the pomegranate garden . At the back , between two heavy pillars , is a doorway .... Two women are heard to pass , laughing and talking , through the corridor outside , and pause at the doorway . One of them looks in curiously . THE LADY . Such a lovely house , Madam Potiphar !— But what is this quiet room ? Your husband 's study ? MADAM POTIPHAR . ( coming in ) Oh , this is nothing — merely the room of one of the slaves . Come , dear Cousin Asenath , and I will show you the garden . The pomegranates are just beginning to blossom . ASENATH . The room of a slave ? Indeed ! He seems to be an educated person ! MADAM POTIPHAR . Educated ? Oh , yes — he is a sort of book-keeper for Potiphar . At least , that is what he is supposed to be . But he is never on hand when he is wanted . If he were here , we might get him to show us through the vineyard . ASENATH . Why not send for him ? I would love to see the vineyard before your husband takes me out in the chariot . MADAM POTIPHAR . ( ironically ) Send for Joseph ? It would be useless . Joseph has affairs of his own on hand , always . ASENATH . ( startled ) Joseph ! Is that his name ? MADAM POTIPHAR . Yes — “ Joseph . ” An ugly , foreign-sounding name , do n't you think ? ASENATH . It is rather an odd name — but I 've heard it before . It was the name of a youth who used to be one of my father 's slaves in Heliopolis . MADAM POTIPHAR . Heliopolis ? I wonder — what was he like ? ASENATH . Oh , he was a pretty boy , with nice manners . MADAM POTIPHAR . I thought for a moment it might be the same one . But this Joseph is an ill-favoured creature — and insolent . . . . What colour was his hair ? ASENATH . I really do n't remember . It 's been a year since he was there .... You have a lovely house , my dear . I 'm so glad I came to see you ! MADAM POTIPHAR . ( also willing to change the subject ) It 's nice to see you again , dear Asenath . We have n't seen each other since we were little girls . Do you remember how we played together in the date-orchard ? And the long , long talks we had ? ASENATH . Do n't let 's be sentimental about our childhood ! MADAM POTIPHAR . Do you remember how we talked about being married ? ( Asenath goes to the little window . ) We hated all men , as I remember . ASENATH . I was eight years old then . . . . Who is that handsome young man I see out there ? MADAM POTIPHAR . In the garden ? ASENATH . Yes . Madam Potiphar comes to the window . MADAM POTIPHAR . That — that is the slave we were speaking of . . . . ASENATH . Joseph ? . . . I wonder if it is the same one ? . . . MADAM POTIPHAR . Well — and what if it were ? ASENATH . He was really a very interesting young man . . . . MADAM POTIPHAR . If you are so anxious to find out , why do n't you go and talk to him ? ASENATH . ( coolly ) I think I shall . She starts toward the door . MADAM POTIPHAR . ( shocked ) Asenath ! You , a daughter of the High Priest of Heliopolis — ASENATH . As such , I am quite accustomed to doing as I please . She goes out . MADAM POTIPHAR . ( looking amusedly after her ) Silly little thing ! ( She stands there thinking . ) There 's no doubt of it ! Joseph did come from Heliopolis last year . But what have I to be afraid of ? ( She sees a pair of sandals on the floor by the table . She picks one of them up , and kisses it passionately , whispering ) — Joseph ! Enter Potiphar . Madam Potiphar puts the sandal behind her back . POTIPHAR . ( a dull , dignified gentleman ) Oh , here 's where you are ! I was looking everywhere for you . But where 's your cousin ? MADAM POTIPHAR . She will be back in a moment . I brought her here to show her the educated slave of whom you are so proud , at work . But he is away somewhere , as usual . POTIPHAR . ( defensively ) He has other duties . MADAM POTIPHAR . Oh , yes , no doubt ! POTIPHAR . What 's the matter now ? MADAM POTIPHAR . Nothing new . You know what I think about this Joseph of yours . POTIPHAR . ( irritated ) Now , if you are going to bring that subject up again —! Well , I tell you flatly , I wo n't do it . MADAM POTIPHAR . You 'd better take my advice ! POTIPHAR . It 's the most unreasonable thing I ever heard of ! For the first time in my life I get an efficient secretary — and you want me to get rid of him . It 's ridiculous . What have you against Joseph , anyway ? MADAM POTIPHAR . I — I do n't think he 's honest . POTIPHAR . Honest ! Who expects the secretary of a government official to be honest ? I do n't want an honest man in charge of my affairs — all I want is a capable one . Besides , how would I know whether he is honest or not ? I can n't bother to go over his accounts , and I could n't understand them if I did . Mathematics , my dear , is not an art that high-class Egyptians excel in . It takes slaves and Hebrews for that . MADAM POTIPHAR . Well , just because he is able to add up a row of figures is no reason why he should be so high-handed with everybody . One would think he was the master here , instead of a slave . POTIPHAR . A private secretary , my dear , is different from an ordinary slave . You must n't expect him to behave like a doorkeeper . I remember now , he complained that you kept wanting him to run errands for you . MADAM POTIPHAR . Yes , and he refused — in the most insolent manner . He is a proud and scheming man , I tell you . I am sure he is plotting some villainy against you . POTIPHAR . ( wearily ) Yes , you have said that before . MADAM POTIPHAR . I say it again . Joseph is a scoundrel . POTIPHAR . You 'll have to do more than say it , my dear . What proof have you of his villainy ? MADAM POTIPHAR . I think you might trust to my womanly intuition . POTIPHAR . Bah ! Joseph is going to stay ! Do you understand ? He pounds on the table for emphasis . Madam Potiphar takes advantage of the occasion to drop the sandal unnoticed . MADAM POTIPHAR . Well , you need n't create a domestic scene . Asenath may return at any moment . POTIPHAR . ( gloomily ) I believe I 'm to take her out in the chariot . MADAM POTIPHAR . You do n't begrudge my guest that much of your attention , do you ? You know I cannot bear to ride behind those wild horses of yours . And she said she wanted to see the city . POTIPHAR . Oh — I 'll go . But I must see to my chariot . ( He claps his hands . A servant appears , and bows deeply . ) Send Joseph here at once . With another deep bow , the slave disappears . A pause . MADAM POTIPHAR . Now you know what it is to have your slave off attending to some business of his own when you want him . POTIPHAR . ( annoyed ) Where can he be ? Enter Joseph . JOSEPH . ( ignoring Madam Potiphar , and making a slight bow to Potiphar ) Here I am , sir . POTIPHAR . ( after a triumphant glance at his wife ) Have my chariot made ready for me , will you ? JOSEPH . It will give me great pleasure to do so , sir . He bows slightly , and goes out . MADAM POTIPHAR . Did you notice his insolence ? POTIPHAR . There you go again ! He said he was glad to do it for me . What more do you want ? MADAM POTIPHAR . You are the stupidest man in Egypt . POTIPHAR . Thank you , my dear . Joseph returns . POTIPHAR . Is the chariot ready so soon , Joseph ? JOSEPH . The chariot is quite ready . POTIPHAR . Very well . ( A pause ) And are those accounts finished yet , Joseph ? JOSEPH . The accounts are quite finished . And I would like to suggest , if I may — He is interrupted by the re-entrance of Asenath . ASENATH . What a lovely garden you have ! MADAM POTIPHAR . ( significantly ) Yes ! ASENATH . The pomegranate blossoms are so beautiful ! MADAM POTIPHAR . You could hardly tear yourself away , could you ? POTIPHAR . ( with a patient smile ) And are you ready for your chariot ride now ? ASENATH . Oh , yes ! I am so eager to see the city ! But I fear my hair needs a touch or two , first . . . . MADAM POTIPHAR . It is so hard to keep one 's hair in order when one walks in the garden . I will take you to my room , dear Asenath . ( To Potiphar ) We shall be ready presently . POTIPHAR . The horses are waiting ! ASENATH . It wo n't take me but a moment ! MADAM POTIPHAR . Come , my dear . ( They go toward the door . ) I am so glad you liked our garden — They go out . POTIPHAR . ( turning to Joseph ) What were you going to say , Joseph ? JOSEPH . You asked me about my accounts . I was about to suggest that I show them to you tonight , when you return from your ride . POTIPHAR . ( alarmed ) No ! No ! I do n't want to see them . . . . I just want to know that everything is getting on well . JOSEPH . Everything is getting along quite well . POTIPHAR . Very good . I have complete confidence in you . . . . Joseph — you have a mathematical mind ; how long would you say it would take a woman to do her hair ? JOSEPH . Not less than half an hour , sir — especially if she has something to talk about with another woman while she is doing it . POTIPHAR . ( surprised ) What should they have to talk about ? JOSEPH . Secrets . POTIPHAR . Secrets ? JOSEPH . What things are women especially interested in , sir ? POTIPHAR . Dress , perhaps ? JOSEPH . Perhaps . POTIPHAR . Housekeeping ? JOSEPH . I doubt it , sir . POTIPHAR . Joseph , you perturb me . Besides food and dress , there is only one subject , so far as I am aware , of interest to women . I hope you do not imply — JOSEPH . Far be it from me , sir , to indulge in implications , with respect to an honoured guest , in the household in which I am a slave . POTIPHAR . Still — it is hard to tell , sometimes . Women are mysterious creatures . What do you think of them , Joseph ? JOSEPH . I try not to , sir . POTIPHAR . You are a wise man . Yes , I suppose you have your difficulties , too . The morality of the slave-girls is not all it should be . But if you will believe me , the morality of our women , too — JOSEPH . Ah , sir ! POTIPHAR . Yes , Joseph , it leaves something to be desired . If you knew the advances that have been made to me by certain great ladies — JOSEPH . If you will permit me to say so , sir , you have my sympathy . POTIPHAR . Joseph — women are the very devil , are n't they ? JOSEPH . They are a great trial , sir . One must learn the secret of dealing with them . POTIPHAR . Do you know that secret ? JOSEPH . I do , sir . POTIPHAR . I am inclined to believe that you really do . You are a remarkable man . But then , you have a naturally cold disposition . It must come easy to you . JOSEPH . Not so easy as you may think , sir . Temperamentally , I am very susceptible to the charms of women . POTIPHAR . Then you are more remarkable even than I thought . Come , what is your secret ? JOSEPH . It is not the sort of secret that one gives away for nothing , sir . POTIPHAR . I am sorry to see you display such a mercenary disposition , Joseph . But I see that I must come to terms with you . How much will you take to teach me your secret ? JOSEPH . This time , sir , I will not be mercenary . I will make you a sporting proposition . POTIPHAR . ( very much interested ) Good ! What is it ? JOSEPH . I will toss up a coin , and let you call it . If you win , I will teach you the secret for nothing . And if you lose — POTIPHAR . And if I lose , you keep your secret — JOSEPH . Not merely that . If you lose , you will give me my freedom . POTIPHAR . But I cannot get along without you , Joseph ! JOSEPH . I will continue to work for you on a salary basis . POTIPHAR . Done ! Where is your coin ? Joseph takes a small coin from his wallet , flips it in the air , and covers it with his hand when it falls on the table . He looks up at Potiphar . POTIPHAR . Much depends on this . What shall I say ? JOSEPH . I know what you will say , sir . POTIPHAR . Impossible ! Tails . Joseph uncovers the coin . Potiphar bends over it . JOSEPH . ( without looking ) It is heads . POTIPHAR . So it is ! I lose — Joseph , you are a lucky man ! JOSEPH . Not at all , sir — a clever one . You see , I knew just how the coin would fall . I tossed it so that it would fall that way . POTIPHAR . But — how did you know what I was going to say ? JOSEPH . I will explain to you . On one side of the coin is a representation of the present Pharaoh , who has denied you advancement because of his daughter 's interest in you . In consequence , you dislike any reminder of him — even on a coin . But on the other side is a representation of the goddess Isis ; she is your favourite goddess — and moreover , you yourself have been heard to remark that her face and figure resemble remarkably that of a certain great lady , whose name — is never mentioned when the story is told . Naturally I knew how you would call the coin . POTIPHAR . ( trembling with rage ) How dare you say such things ! Do you forget that I can have you beaten with rods ? JOSEPH . ( calmly ) Do you forget , sir , that I am no longer a slave ? Free men are not beaten in Egypt . POTIPHAR . Free ? JOSEPH . Unless Potiphar takes back his word . It is true that I have no witnesses to it . POTIPHAR . ( with great dignity ) Witnesses are unnecessary . I had forgotten for the moment . Let this remind me . ( He gives Joseph a ring . ) You are a free man . And so — what I thought was an insolence is merely a pleasantry . But — you take a quick advantage of your freedom . JOSEPH . I accept the rebuke . POTIPHAR . And — free man or slave — Joseph , you know too much ! Potiphar walks out of the room . . . . Joseph seats himself at the table , and takes up a scroll of papyrus . He reads a moment , then claps his hands . A slave enters , stands before the table , and bows . JOSEPH . ( consulting the papyrus ) Bear word to the overseer of the winepress that the grapes in the southeast section will be brought in for pressing tomorrow morning . . . . Bear word to the chief carpenter that a table and two couches , of the standard pattern , are wanted — at once . . . . Bear word to the chief pastry-cook that his request for another helper is denied . Joseph makes a gesture of dismissal , and the slave , with a bow , goes out . Joseph rises , and walking around the table , holds up ‘ his hand to look at his ring . JOSEPH . Freedom ! Madam Potiphar strolls in . MADAM POTIPHAR . ( familiarly ) They have gone . . . . Joseph picks up a scroll from the table . MADAM POTIPHAR . ( sharply ) Joseph ! JOSEPH . ( respectfully ) Yes , madam . MADAM POTIPHAR . I understood you to say a while ago that your work was quite finished ? JOSEPH . Yes , madam . MADAM POTIPHAR . Then you have plenty of time now .... JOSEPH . Yes , plenty of time for more work . MADAM POTIPHAR . Well , you need not begin immediately . I want a little of your time just now . JOSEPH . If it is an errand , I will call one of the slaves . MADAM POTIPHAR . Do you mean — one of the other slaves ? JOSEPH . I , madam , am no longer a slave . He holds up his hand , and looks at the ring . MADAM POTIPHAR . ( incredulous ) How did this happen ? Did you buy your freedom , perchance ? JOSEPH . No . Your husband gave it to me a moment ago . MADAM POTIPHAR . Gave it to you ? You mean that you swindled him out of it in some way ! JOSEPH . As you please , madam . MADAM POTIPHAR . Well , it is his own affair if he wishes to give away such valuable property . Only — it is difficult to adjust oneself to a change like that . JOSEPH . Do not , I pray , let the change disturb you . MADAM POTIPHAR . No , I insist . It is both a duty and a pleasure . Since you are now a free man , Joseph , I propose that we treat each other as equals and friends . JOSEPH . That will be very considerate of us both . MADAM POTIPHAR . Sir , you are insolent . No , no — I mean , my friend , you are very rude . JOSEPH . Thank you for making the distinction . And now , since we are to treat each other as equals and friends , I beg you — ( he takes some small objects from his wallet and holds them out in his hand ) — to take these hairpins , which are the mementos of your various visits to my room . As a slave , no suspicion , of course , could attach to me in connection with a lady of your rank . But as equals and friends , we both have our reputations to preserve . MADAM POTIPHAR . ( taking them ) Thank you . ( She restores them to her hair . ) I lose them everywhere I go . They fall out every time I speak . They mean nothing whatever . JOSEPH . It is unnecessary to explain that to me . I am perfectly aware of the fact . MADAM POTIPHAR . You are perfectly aware of everything , are n't you , Joseph ? JOSEPH . Everything that it is to my interest to be aware of , madam . MADAM POTIPHAR . No — there is one thing you do n't know , and I am going to tell you . JOSEPH . Proceed , madam . He takes the coin from the table . MADAM POTIPHAR . ( coming close to him and looking boldly into his eyes ) Ca n't you guess ? At this moment Joseph drops the coin from his hand , and it rolls away . Joseph starts , looks after it , and goes across the room to pick it up . JOSEPH . One must take care of the small coins ! MADAM POTIPHAR . ( angrily ) Oh ! She flings off to the window , Joseph returns and seats himself on the little stool at the nearer end of the table , with a papyrus in front of him . He reads it in silence . Madam Potiphar comes and seats herself on the table , and looks down at him . He continues to study the papyrus . She leans over to see what he is doing , and then , as he pays no attention , she turns so that she is reclining prone along its length , facing him , her chin in her hands , one foot idly waving in the air . MADAM POTIPHAR . ( gently ) Am I bothering you ? JOSEPH . Not at all . MADAM POTIPHAR . I like to watch you work . JOSEPH . I do n't mind . MADAM POTIPHAR . You are very interesting to look at , do you know ? JOSEPH . ( absently ) Yes , I know . MADAM POTIPHAR . Little egotist ! JOSEPH . ( unperturbed ) Yes . He rises and seats himself at the side of the table . Propping his papyrus against the reclining body of Madam Potiphar , he takes a new sheet of papyrus , and commences to copy a passage . MADAM POTIPHAR . ( wriggling about to look at him ) What are you copying ? JOSEPH . Be careful . Do n't jiggle my manuscript , please ! MADAM POTIPHAR . I asked , what are you copying ? JOSEPH . I am copying some inaccurate information about the climate of Egypt , with reference to the yearly crop-yield . . . . I wonder if there is any one in Egypt who has exact information on that subject ? . . . MADAM POTIPHAR . The yearly crop-yield ! What do you care about the yearly crop-yield ? JOSEPH . Never mind . You would n't understand if I told you . MADAM POTIPHAR . You are quite right . Besides , I did n't come here to talk about crops . JOSEPH . ( writing ) No . You came here to talk about me . MADAM POTIPHAR . I came here to talk about my cousin Asenath . You knew she was coming — why did n't you tell me you had been in service in her father 's household in Heliopolis ? JOSEPH . ( writing ) It was n't necessary for me to tell you . I knew she would . MADAM POTIPHAR . No doubt you think we sat there all the time she was combing her hair , and talked about you ! JOSEPH . ( writing ) Precisely . MADAM POTIPHAR . I suppose you know she is crazy about you ! JOSEPH . ( still writing ) Is she ? MADAM POTIPHAR . She does n't put it just that way . She says she takes an interest in your future . JOSEPH . ( continuing to work ) She does n't take half as much interest in it as I do . MADAM POTIPHAR . She told me your romantic story : how you had been sold by your brothers into slavery because you wore a coat of many colours . Joseph , did you wear a coat of many colours ? That seems a curious thing for any one to be angry about . JOSEPH . ( not ceasing to copy the manuscript ) I wore it only figuratively — I am wearing it now . And it always makes you angry . MADAM POTIPHAR . You mean the cloak of your insolence ? JOSEPH . I mean the cloak of my pride . MADAM POTIPHAR . I can sympathize with your brothers . . . . Are you in love with her , Joseph ? JOSEPH . I am not . He has finished — he rolls up the papyrus . MADAM POTIPHAR . No — so I told her . JOSEPH . But she did n't believe you . MADAM POTIPHAR . You seem to know our conversation pretty well . JOSEPH . I can imagine it . MADAM POTIPHAR . Well , go ahead and imagine it . What did we say ? JOSEPH . You both lied to each other . MADAM POTIPHAR . About what ? JOSEPH . About me . MADAM POTIPHAR . ( sitting up ) Your conceit is insufferable ! JOSEPH . ( rising politely ) I hope so . MADAM POTIPHAR . Is that a dismissal ? JOSEPH . If you will be so kind . MADAM POTIPHAR . You interest me more and more . JOSEPH . I feared as much . MADAM POTIPHAR . I detest you ! JOSEPH . It is one of the symptoms . MADAM POTIPHAR . Young man , do you really know nothing about love ? JOSEPH . If I do n't , it is not the fault of the women of Egypt . MADAM POTIPHAR . You are a strange youth . It cannot be that you love this work you are doing .... JOSEPH . No , madam — I hate it . MADAM POTIPHAR . Then where do you find your happiness ? Tell me , Joseph — what is the happiest hour of the day for you ? JOSEPH . ( with complete sincerity ) It is that hour when I have finished the day 's work , and can lie down upon my couch . It is the hour before sleep comes , when the room is filled with moonlight , and there is no sound except the crickets singing in the orchard , and the music of the toads in the pool . The wind of the night comes in , cool with dew . Then I am happy — for I can lie and make plans for my future . MADAM POTIPHAR . ( softly ) And in that hour of moonlight and dew and the music of the crickets , and the ancient love-song of the toads in the pool , when all the earth abandons itself to love ,— what would you say to a woman who stole in to you like a moonbeam , like a breath of the night-wind , like a strain of music ? JOSEPH . I would tell her — to go , as her presence would interfere with my plans . MADAM POTIPHAR . I call the gods to witness . A truly virtuous young man ! JOSEPH . ( jumping down from the table , angrily ) Virtue ! Virtue ! Oh , you stupid Egyptians ! As though I cared about Virtue ! MADAM POTIPHAR . Well , what in the name of all the gods is it that you care about ? JOSEPH . ( vehemently ) In the name of all the gods , madam , I care about time . MADAM POTIPHAR . Time ! But what can you do with time ? JOSEPH . What can I do without it ? MADAM POTIPHAR . But I do not understand ! JOSEPH . ( in a cold rage ) Of course you do not understand . You are a great lady — and a fool . I am a wise man — and but an hour ago a slave . I have more intellect than all the population of Egypt put together . Do you expect me to be content to remain as I am ? I want power and riches — and I intend to achieve them . And I cannot achieve them if I allow women to waste my time . MADAM POTIPHAR . ( deeply angered at last ) Very well , I go — taking your secret with me ! ( She goes . ) JOSEPH . ( furiously , to the empty room ) Virtue ! My God ! He sits down at his desk and writes vexedly .</titlePart></docTitle>

     <stage>Night . The room is filled with moonlight . Joseph is asleep at his desk .... He suddenly springs up in agitation .</stage>

      <speaker>JOSEPH</speaker>
      <p>Ah ! . . . It was only a dream ! But what a dream ! I thought I saw at the door —<stage>he points</stage>a strange and terrible animal !<stage>There is a sound at the door , and he starts back in terror .</stage>There it is now !

      <p>So you have come to afflict me with more romantic folly !</p>

      <p>What is the matter with me ? Nothing is the matter with me . Why do you ask ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ASENATH</speaker>
      <p>I think you are not well . You are behaving queerly . You must have been working too hard . How are your nerves ? She approaches him solicitously .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOSEPH</speaker>
      <p><stage>retreating around the table</stage>Leave me alone , I tell you ! Even in my own room can I have no peace ? Must I be dogged even in my dreams by shameless and unscrupulous females ? Oh , unfortunate youth that I am !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ASENATH</speaker>
      <p><stage>setting her candle down on the table</stage>Now I know what is the matter with you , Joseph ! You have an obsession .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOSEPH</speaker>
      <p>What is an obsession ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ASENATH</speaker>
      <p>Do n't you know what an obsession is ?<stage>She sits down on the stool at the end of the table</stage>Have n't you heard of the great wizard in the land of the barbarians who explains everything by a new magic ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOSEPH</speaker>
      <p>Is he the author of that popular new dream-book ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ASENATH</speaker>
      <p>Yes . All Egypt is mad on the subject of dreams . Everybody , from Pharaoh to the fiddler 's wife , is telling about his latest dream , or listening to some one else tell his .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOSEPH</speaker>
      <p><stage>sitting down on the other stool</stage>Speaking of dreams , I had a curious one just before you came in .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ASENATH</speaker>
      <p>Did you , Joseph ? Tell it to me . She leans across the table .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOSEPH</speaker>
      <p>I dreamed — that I saw a dragon with many heads . And each head had the face of a beautiful woman . I was frightened . But I took up a sword and struck . And all the heads except one were severed . All except one . And this one had upon it a crown of iron and a crown of gold . And then the dragon took the crowns from its head , and offered them to me ! I did not know what to do . . . . And then I awoke .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ASENATH</speaker>
      <p>Shall I interpret your dream for you , Joseph ? The dragon with the many heads signifies the women of Egypt , who are all in love with you . The one that remains when you have struck off the rest , is the one who will succeed where all the others have failed . The crown of iron signifies power . The crown of gold , riches . She offers them to you . . .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOSEPH</speaker>
      <p><stage>leaning forward</stage>Asenath — do you really think it means —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ASENATH</speaker>
      <p><stage>coldly</stage>I really think it means that you have a persecution — mania . You imagine that every woman you meet has designs on you . . . . I suppose you think that I came here to make love to you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOSEPH</speaker>
      <p>No , my dear Asenath . I know better than that . When young women come to my room at midnight , it is only to borrow a book to read — or to ask my advice about their personal affairs . I know , because they tell me so . Which did you come for — a book , or advice ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ASENATH</speaker>
      <p>Neither . I came to give a book to you — and to give you some advice .... Do you remember telling me , once in Heliopolis , that the man who knew enough about the climate of Egypt to predict a famine could make himself the richest man in the kingdom ? Well — here is everything you want to know , in an old book I found in my father 's library in Heliopolis . This is the book I came to give you . She holds out a scroll .</p>

      <speaker>ASENATH</speaker>
      <p><stage>interrupting him</stage>And now the advice . It is this . Ally yourself to the wisest woman in the land of Egypt — one who can teach you to interpret the dreams of Pharaoh . Then you shall become the second in power in the kingdom .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOSEPH</speaker>
      <p>The second in power in the kingdom ! Asenath — do not mock me . Can you do this ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ASENATH</speaker>
      <p>I swear that I can and will !</p>

      <p>You — you do n't love me ?</p>

      <p>Not in the least !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOSEPH</speaker>
      <p>But — but — then what are you doing it for ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ASENATH</speaker>
      <p>I am doing it for myself . Do you think I wish to stay in Heliopolis all my life ? No — I want power and riches — and I intend to have them . But I cannot get them , unfortunately , without wasting my time with some man .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p>Admirable !</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOSEPH</speaker>
      <p>I say that you are a woman after my own heart .<stage>He holds out his arms . She retreats to the other end of the table .</stage>I did not think that there existed in all the world a woman as profoundly egoistic , as unscrupulously ambitious , as myself . You are my true mate . Come , we shall rule Egypt together !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ASENATH</speaker>
      <p><stage>in front of the table</stage>Am I to understand that this is a strictly business proposition ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOSEPH</speaker>
      <p>No . It is a declaration of love . I adore you ! I desire you ! I cannot live without you !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ASENATH</speaker>
      <p>Please do n't be silly .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOSEPH</speaker>
      <p><stage>hurt</stage>Is it possible that you do not believe in my love ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ASENATH</speaker>
      <p>It is a little difficult . . . .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOSEPH</speaker>
      <p>You think that I am a hard man — and so I am . But when I look at you , I tremble and grow weak . My knees are become as water , and the blood roaring in my veins confuses me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ASENATH</speaker>
      <p>Can I , a mere woman , so disturb you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOSEPH</speaker>
      <p>You have more than a mere woman 's beauty . Your hands are lotus petals . Your eyes are silver fireflies mirrored in a pool . Your breasts are white birds nestling behind the leaves of a pomegranate tree .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ASENATH</speaker>
      <p>You have a smooth tongue , Joseph ! One would think you really were in love at last . . . .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOSEPH</speaker>
      <p>I love you more than anything else in the world . You mean more to me than power , more than riches , more than freedom itself .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ASENATH</speaker>
      <p>I could almost believe that you are in earnest . . . .</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>JOSEPH</speaker>
      <p>Tell me , O lovely creature for whom my soul and body thirst , how can I prove my sincerity ? What proof can I give you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ASENATH</speaker>
      <p>You can give me — that ring ! She points to the ring which Potiphar has given him .</p>

      <speaker>THE POLICEMAN</speaker>
      <p>Good night to you , then . He idly watches the angelic figure walk away , and then stares with amazement as it spreads its wings and soars to the top of Washington Arch . Pausing there a moment , it soars again in the air , and is seen wafting its way over the neighbouring housetops to the northeast . The policeman shakes his head in disapproval . Jimmy Pendleton is dozing in an easy chair before the grate-fire in Ms studio in Washington Mews . A yellow-backed French novel has fallen from his knee to the floor . It is Anatole France 's “ La Revolte des Anges ” . A suitcase stands beside the chair . Jimmy is evidently about to go on some journey . A clock begins to strike somewhere . Jimmy Pendleton awakes .</p>

      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p>What a queer dream !<stage>He looks at his watch .</stage>Twelve o'clock . The taxi ought to be here .<stage>He takes two tickets from his pocket , looks at them , and puts them back . Then he commences to pace nervously up and down the room , muttering to himself</stage>— Fool ! Idiot ! Imbecile !<stage>He is not , so that you could notice it , any of these things . He is a very handsome man of forty . There is the blast of an auto-horn outside . He makes an angry gesture .</stage>Too late ! That 's the taxi .<stage>But he stands uncertainly in the middle of the floor . There is a loud pounding on the knocker .</stage>Yes , yes ! He makes a movement toward the door , when it suddenly opens , and a lovely lady enters . He stares at her in surprise .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p>That 's just it — you speak so cynically about it . I do n't believe you 're in love with me at all !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p>Nonsense ! Of course I 'm in love with you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p><stage>sadly</stage>No you 're not .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p><stage>angrily</stage>But I tell you I am !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p>No . . . .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p>Foolish child !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p>Well , let 's not quarrel about it . We 'll talk about something else .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p><stage>vehemently</stage>What do you suppose this insanity is if it is not love ? What do you imagine leads me to this preposterous escapade , if not that preposterous passion ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p>That is n't the way I love you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p>Then why do you come with me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p>Perhaps I 'm not coming .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p>Yes you are . It 's foolish — mad — wicked — but you 're coming .<stage>She begins to cry softly .</stage>If not — ten minutes away is safety and peace and comfort . Shall I call a taxi for you ?<stage>She shakes her head .</stage>No , I thought not . Oh , it 's love all right . . . . Antony and Cleopatra defying the Mann Act ! Romance ! Beauty ! Adventure ! How can you doubt it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p>I hate you !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p><stage>cheerfully</stage>I do n't mind .<stage>Smiling</stage>I rather hate you myself . And that 's the final proof that this is love .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p><stage>sobbing</stage>I thought love was something quite — different !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p>You thought it was beautiful . It is n't . It 's just blithering , blathering folly . We 'll both regret it tomorrow .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p>I Wo n't !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p>Yes you will . It 's human nature . Face the facts .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p><stage>tearfully</stage>Facing the facts is one thing and being in love is another ,</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p>Quite so . Well , how long do you think your love for me will last ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p>For ever !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p>H 'm ! I predict that you will fall in love with the next man you meet .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p>I think you 're perfectly horrid .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p>So do I. I disapprove of myself violently . I 'm a doddering lunatic , incapable of thinking of anything but you . I can n't work . I can n't eat , I can n't sleep . I 'm no use to the world . I 'm not a man , I 'm a mess . I 'm about to do something silly because I can n't do anything else .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p><stage>pouting</stage>You 've no respect for me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p>None whatever . I love you . And I 'm going to carry you off .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p>You 're a brute .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p>Absolutely . I 'd advise you to go straight home .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p><stage>defiantly</stage>Perhaps I shall !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p>Then go quick .<stage>He takes out his watch .</stage>In one minute , if you are still here , I shall pick you up and carry you off to South America .— Quick ! there 's the door !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p><stage>faintly</stage>I — I want to go . . . .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p>Well , why do n't you ? . . . Thirty seconds !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p>I — I can n't !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p><stage>shutting his watch</stage>Time 's up . The die is cast !<stage>He lifts her from the chair . She clings to him helplessly .</stage>My darling ! My treasure ! My beloved !— Idiot that I am ! He kisses her fiercely .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p><stage>struggling in his arms</stage>No ! No ! No ! Stop !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p>Never !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p>Stop ! Please ! Please ! Oh ! . . . The light suddenly goes out , and an instant later blazes out again , revealing the Angel , who has suddenly arrived in the middle of the room . The two of them stare at the apparition .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p><stage>politely</stage>I hope I am not intruding ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p>Why — why — not exactly !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p><stage>in his arms , indignantly</stage>Jimmy ! who is that man ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p><stage>becoming aware of her and putting her down carefully</stage>I — why — the fact is , I do n't —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p>The fact is , madam , I am his Guardian Angel .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p>An Angel ! Oh !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p>Tell me , have I intruded ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p>No , not at all !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p>Thank you for reassuring me . I feared for a moment that I had made an inopportune entrance . I was about to suggest that I withdraw until you had finished the — er — ceremony — which I seem to have interrupted .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p><stage>surprised</stage>But was n't that what you came for — to interrupt ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p>I beg your pardon !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p><stage>bewilderedly</stage>I mean — if you are my Guardian Angel , and all that sort of thing , you must have come to — to interfere !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p>I hope you will not think I would be capable of such presumption .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p><stage>puzzled</stage>You do n't want to — so to speak — reform me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p>Not at all . Why , I scarcely know you !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p>But you 're my — my Guardian Angel , you say ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p>Ah , yes , to be sure . But the relation of angelic guardianship has for some hundreds of years been a purely nominal one . We have come to feel that it is best to allow mortals to attend to their own affairs .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p><stage>abruptly</stage>Then what did you come for ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p>For a change . One becomes tired of familiar scenes . And I thought that perhaps my relationship to you might serve in lieu of an introduction . I wanted to be among friends .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p>Oh — I see .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p>Of course . We 're delighted to have you with us . Wo n't you sit down ?<stage>She leads the way to the fire .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p><stage>perching on back of one of the big chairs</stage>If you do n't mind ! My wings , you know .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p><stage>hesitantly</stage>Have a cigarette ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p>Thank you .<stage>He takes one .</stage>I am most anxious to learn the more important of your earthly arts and sciences . Please correct me if I go wrong . This is my first attempt , remember . He blows out a puff of smoke .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p><stage>from the settle</stage>You 're doing it very nicely .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p>It is incense to the mind .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p><stage>laughing , blowing a series of smoke rings</stage>You must learn to do it like this !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p><stage>in awe</stage>That is too wonderful an art . I fear I can never learn it !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p>I will teach you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p><stage>earnestly</stage>If you were my teacher , I think I could learn anything .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p><stage>giggles charmingly</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p><stage>embarrassed</stage>Really , Annabelle ...!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p>What 's the matter ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p>Ordinarily I would n't mind your flirting with strangers , but ...</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p><stage>indignantly</stage>Jimmy ! How can you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p>It was my fault , I 'm sure — if fault there was . But what is it — to flirt ? You see , I wish to learn everything .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p>I hope you never learn that .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p>I put myself in your hands .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p>Er — would you like a — drink ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p>Thank you . I am very thirsty .<stage>Taking the glass .</stage>This is very different from what we have in Heaven .<stage>He tastes it . A look of gratified surprise appears on his face .</stage>And much better !<stage>He drains the glass and hands it back .</stage>May I have some more ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p>Be careful !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p>What should I be careful of ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p>Do n't drink too much of that — if it 's the first time .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p>Why not ? It is an excellent drink .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p><stage>laughing</stage>The maternal instinct ! She is afraid you may make yourself — ridiculous .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p>Angels do not care for appearances .<stage>He stands up magnificently in the chair , towering above them .</stage>Besides . . .<stage>refilling his glass</stage>I feel that you do an injustice to this drink . Already it has made a new being of me .<stage>He looks at Annabelle .</stage>I feel an emotion that I have never known before . If I were in heaven , I should sing .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p>Oh ! Wo n't you sing ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p>The fact is , I know nothing but hymns . And I 'm tired of them . That was one reason why I left heaven . And this robe . . . .<stage>He descends to the floor , viewing his garment with disapproval .</stage>Have you an extra suit of clothes you could lend me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p><stage>reflectively</stage>Yes , I think I have some things that might fit .<stage>The Angel waits .</stage>Do you want them now ? I 'll look . He goes into the bedroom . . . . The Angel looks at Annabelle until his gaze becomes insupportable , and she covers her eyes . Then he comes over to her side .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p><stage>gravely</stage>I am very much afraid of you .<stage>He takes her hands in his .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p><stage>smiling</stage>One would never guess it !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p>I am more afraid of you than I was of God . But even though I fear you , I must come close to you , and touch you . I feel a strange , new emotion like fire in my veins . This world has become beautiful to me because you are in it . I want to stay here so that I may be with you . . . .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p><stage>shaken , but doubting</stage>For how long ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p>For ever . . . .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p><stage>in his arms</stage>Darling !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p>I am so ignorant ! There is something I want to do right now , only I do not know how to go about it properly . He bends shyly toward her lips .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p>I will teach you . She kisses him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p>Heaven was nothing to this . They kiss again . . . . Enter Jimmy , with an old suit of clothes over his arm . He pauses in dumbfounderment . At last he regains his voice .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p>Well ! They look up . Neither of them is perturbed .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p><stage>blandly</stage>Has something happened to annoy you ?<stage>Jimmy shakes the clothes at him in an outraged gesture .</stage>Oh , my new costume . Thank you so much ! He takes the clothes from Jimmy , and examines them with interest .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p><stage>bitterly , to Annabelle</stage>I suppose I 've no right to complain . You can make love to anybody you like . In fact , now that I come to think of it , I predicted this very thing . I said you 'd fall in love with the next man you met . So it 's off with the old love , and —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p><stage>calmly</stage>I have never been in love before .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p>The fickleness of women is notorious . It is exceeded only by their mendacity . But Angels have up to this time stood in good repute . Your conduct , sir , is scandalous . I am amazed at you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p>It may be scandalous , but it should not amaze you . It has happened too often before . I could quote you many texts from learned theological works . “ And the sons of God looked at the daughters of men and saw that they were fair . ” But even if it were as unusual as you imagine , that would not deter me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p>You are an unscrupulous wretch . If these are the manners of Heaven , I am glad it is so far away , and means of communication so difficult . A few more of you would corrupt the morals of five continents . You are utterly depraved — Here ! what are you doing ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p>I am taking off my robes , so as to put on my new clothes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p>Spare the common decencies at least . Go in the other room .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p>Certainly , if that is the custom here . With the clothes over his arm , he goes into the bedroom .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p><stage>sternly , to Annabelle</stage>And now tell me , what do you mean by this ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p><stage>simply</stage>— We are in love .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p>Do you mean to say you would throw me over for that fellow ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p>Why not ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p>What good is he ? All he can do is sing hymns . In three months he 'll be a tramp .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p>I do n't care . And he wo n't be a tramp . I 'll look after him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p><stage>sneeringly</stage>The maternal instinct ! Well , take care of him if you like . But of course you know that in six weeks he 'll fall in love with somebody else ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p>No he wo n't . I 'm sure that I am the only girl in the world to him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p>Of course you 're the only girl in the world to him — now . You 're the only one he 's ever seen . But wait till he sees the others ! Six weeks ? On second thought I make it three days . Immortal love !<stage>He laughs .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p>What difference does it make ? You do n't understand . Whether it lasts a day or a year , while it lasts it will be immortal . The Angel enters , dressed in Jimmy 's old clothes , and carrying his wings in his hands . He seems exhilarated .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p>How do I look ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p>It is customary to wear one 's tie tucked inside the vest .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p><stage>flinging the ends of the gorgeous necktie over his shoulder</stage>No ! Though I have become a man , I do not without some regret put on the dull garb of mortality . I would not have my form lose all its original brightness . Even so it is the excess of glory obscured .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p><stage>coming over to him</stage>You are quite right , darling . She tucks the tie inside his vest .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p>Thank you , beloved .— And now these wings ! Take them , and burn them with your own sweet hands , so that I can never leave you , even if I would .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p>No ! I would rather put them away for you in a closet , so that you can go and look at them any time you want to , and see that you have the means to freedom ready to your hand . I shall never hold you against your will . I do not want to burn your wings . I really do n't ! But if you insist —! She takes the wings , and approaches the grate .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p><stage>to the Angel</stage>Do n't let her do it ! Fool ! You do n't know what you are doing . Listen to me ! You think that she is wonderful — superior — divine . It is only natural . There are moments when I have thought so myself . But I know why I thought so , and you have yet to learn . Keep your wings , my friend , against the day of your awakening — the day when the glamour of sex has vanished , and you see in her , as you will see , an inferior being , with a weak body , a stunted mind , devoid of creative power , almost devoid of imagination , utterly lacking in critical capacity — a being who does not know how to work , nor how to talk , nor even how to play ! Annabelle , dropping the wings on the hearth , stares at him , in speechless anger .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p>Sir ! Do you refer in these vulgar and insulting terms to the companion of my soul , the desire of my heart , the perfect lover whose lips have kindled my dull senses to ecstasy ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p>I do . Remember that I know her better than you do , young man . Take my advice and leave her alone . Even now it is not too late ! Save yourself from this folly while there is still time !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p>Never !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p>Then take these tickets — and I hope that I never see either of you again ! He holds out the tickets . Annabelle , after a pause , steps forward and takes them .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANNABELLE</speaker>
      <p>That is really sweet of you , Jimmy ! The blast of an auto-horn is heard outside .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JIMMY</speaker>
      <p><stage>bitterly</stage>And there 's my taxi . Take that , too .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE ANGEL</speaker>
      <p>Farewell ! He opens the door . Annabelle , at his side , turns and blows Jimmy a kiss . Stonily , Jimmy watches them go out . Then he picks up his suitcase and goes , with an air of complete finality , into the other room . There is a moment 's silence , and then the door opens softly , and the Angel looks in , enters surreptitiously , seizes up the wings , and with them safely clasped to his bosom , vanishes again through the door .</p>

      <stage>A small room with a little table in the centre , and a chair on either side of it . At the back is the embrasure of a French window opening on a balcony .

     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Who can it be ? Who would send me a present ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>What a question , Donna Violante ! Not a man in Seville , not a man in</l>
       <l>Spain , but would send you gifts if he dared . It is not “ Who would ? ” but</l>
       <l>“ Who could ? ”</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>No man , as you know , Luciano , has that right .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Have you so soon forgotten your husband , Violante ? He , surely , has that right ! And it is thoughtful of him , too , to pause in the midst of his antiquarian researches in Rome , to think of his young wife and send her a gift . He appreciates you more than I imagined . Under his grizzled and scientific exterior , he is a human being . I respect him for it . He puts down his hat and stick .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>My husband ! But why , then , do you bring it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>I was commissioned by him to do so . I received the package , this morning , with a letter . Shall I read it to you ? He takes out the letter .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Yes .... But why should he not send it direct to me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Your husband is a man of curious and perverse mind , Violante , and , in spite of his interest in dead things , not without some insight into the living soul . I think it gave him an obscure pleasure to think of me the bearer of his gift . But shall we let him speak for himself ? He opens the envelope .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Yes . Read the letter . She sits down to listen .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>reading</stage>“ My dear young friend : I am sending you a package , which I beg you , as a favour , to deliver to Donna Violante , my wife . It contains a gift of an unusual sort , which you as well as she will appreciate . As you know , it is the unusual which interests me — the unusual and the old . And yet , antiquarian though I am , I flatter myself that I understand the mind of a beautiful young woman , especially when that young woman is my wife . I have found her a mirror . Yes , a mirror ! Under this name it seems commonplace enough , but when you have seen it I do not think you will say so . It is not the kind of mirror that is ordinarily found in a lady 's boudoir . Yet it will give to her a faithful reflection of her loveliness as it is in truth . I found it — this will interest you — in the Catacombs . You would not think the early Christians had so much vanity ! Yet it was a mirror into which the virgin-martyrs-to-be of the time of Nero looked each day . As they looked , let Donna Violante look . Say to her from me — ‘ Look long and well into this mirror , and profit by what you see . ’ — Humbly your friend , Don Vincenzio . ” . . . Is not that a pleasant letter ? He restores the letter to his pocket .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>There is something in it that makes me shiver .... Let us look . She takes the paper from the box and is about to open it when he stops her .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>No . Not now . I want to talk to you . SHE<stage>lapsing into a hostile coldness</stage>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>You know what I have to say . I have said it so often . I shall say it once more .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>appealingly</stage>Luciano !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>No , let me speak . You are not happy . You do not love your husband . And you are too young and beautiful to live without love .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Please !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>I love you . And you love me . Why do you not surrender yourself to love ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Why do you say such things ? They hurt me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>They are reality . Does reality hurt you ? Are you living in a shadow-world , that you should flinch from the hard touch of truth ? I say it again . I love you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Before you started to talk like that , we were so happy together .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Before I spoke out the truth of my own heart and yours . You did n't want it spoken out . You did n't want to be told you were in love . It was a thing too harsh and sweet . It frightened you to think of . You wanted us to sit for ever , like two lovers painted on a fan , fixed in an everlasting and innocuous bliss .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Well , you have succeeded in spoiling that . You have made me unhappy , if that gives you any pleasure .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>It was not I who have spoiled your shadow-world . It is love , coming like the dawn on wings of flame , and shattering the shadows with spears of gold . It is love that has made you unhappy . You tremble at its coming , and try to flee . But the day of love has come for you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Ah , if it had only come before — before ....</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Before you married that perverse old man . If it had come while you were still a maiden , free , with a right to give yourself up to it ! Ah , you would have given yourself gloriously ! It is beautiful — but it is a dream , and the time calls for a deed . We love each other . We can take our happiness now . Will you do it ? Will you come away with me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>No .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Then I if you cannot take your happiness , give me mine . If you cannot be a woman , be an angel , and lean down from your dream heaven to slake my earthly thirst .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>No .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>No angel ? Then a goddess ! You want to be worshipped . You want to be adored . I will worship you , but not from afar , I will adore you in my own fashion . I will praise you without words , and you shall be the answer to my prayer . Will you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>No .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>“ No . ” “ No . ” “ No . ” How did your lips learn to say that word so easily ? They are not made to say such a word . They are too young , too red , to say “ No ” to Life . When you say that word , the world grows black . The stars go out , the leaves wither , the heart stops beating . It is a word that kills . It is the word of Death . Dare you say it again ? Answer me , do we love each other ? . . . Silence .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>I think . . . I am going . . . to cry .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>And tears . Tears are a slave 's answer . Speak . Defend yourself . Why do you stay here ? Why do you deny yourself happiness ? Why wo n't you come with me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>I cannot .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Always the same phrase that means nothing . Ah , Violante , lady of few words , you know how to baffle argument . If I could only make you speak ! If I could only see what the thoughts are that darken your will !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Do n't .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>By God ! I wonder that I do n't hate you instead of love you . There is something ignobly feminine about you . You are incapable of action — almost incapable of speech . Your lips are shut tight against kisses , and when they open to speak , all that they say is “ Do n't . ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>What do you expect to gain by scolding me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>I gain the satisfaction of telling you the truth — that you have the most cowardly soul that was ever belied by a glorious body . Who would think to look at you that you were afraid ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>It 's no use bullying me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>I know that , Violante . It 's the poorest way to woo a woman . But I have tried every other way . I have pleaded , and been answered with silence . I have wooed you with caresses , and been answered with tears .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>I am sorry , Luciano .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>I want you to be glad .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>I am glad — glad of you — in spite of everything .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Gladness is something fiercer than that . You are too tame . Oh , if I could reach and rouse your soul !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>My soul is yours already ....</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>And your body ...?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>It is impossible .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>No . It is n't impossible . But I 'll tell you what is impossible . This — for me to go on loving you and despising you .... I came here today to make one last appeal to you . I do n't mean it as a threat . But I am going away tonight for ever — with you , or without you . You must decide .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>rising</stage>But — I do n't want you to go , Luciano !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>You will miss me , I know . But do n't think too much of that . You will find a new friend — if you decide against me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>And I must decide now ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Yes — now .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>But how can I ? Oh , Luciano !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>I know it is hard . But I will not make it harder . Violante : I have sought to appeal to your emotion when my appeal to your will was in vain . But tonight I will leave you to make your own decision . You must come to me freely or not at all . There must be no regrets .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>I cannot do it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>If you say that when I return I will accept it as a final answer . I am going out on the balcony — for a long minute . And while I am gone you must decide what to do . Will you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>turning at the window</stage>And if while I am gone you wish to recall my arguments to your mind —<stage>he points to the box on the table</stage>— look in your mirror there . Your beauty will plead for me . As Don Vincenzio said : Look long and well into that mirror , lady , and profit by what you see . He goes out . . . . She looks after him , and when he is gone holds out her arms towards the door . She makes a step towards it , and then stops , her hands falling to her sides . Her head droops for a moment or two , and then is slowly lifted . Her eyes sweep the room imploringly , and rest on the image of the Virgin . She goes over to it and kneels .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Mary , Mother of God , give me a sign . I do not know what to do . Help me . I must decide . Love has entered my heart , and it may be that I cannot be a good woman any longer . You will be kind to me , and pity me , and send me a sign . Perhaps you will let me have my lover , for you are kind . She crosses herself , rises , and looks around . She sees the box on the table , and puts her hand to her face with a gesture of sudden thought . She smiles . Perhaps that is the sign ! She goes to the box and touches it . He said it would plead for him . . . . She opens it — and starts back with a gesture and a cry . It is the sign ! With one hand over her heart she approaches it again . She takes out of the box and puts on the table a skull . . . . She stares at it a long while , and then turns with a shiver . How cold it is here ! Where are the lights ? She is compelled to look again . I had never thought of death . My heart is cold , too . The chill of the grave is on me . Was I ever in love ? It seems strange to remember . What is his name ? I almost have forgotten . And he is waiting for me . I will show him this . We should have looked at it together . . . . A silence , as her mood changes . So he had planned it ! He wanted to cast the chill of the grave upon our love . He saw it all as though he had been here . He sent us — this ! How well he knew me — better than I knew myself . An old man 's cunning ! To stop my pulses throbbing with love , and put out the fever in my eyes . A trick ! Yes , but it suffices . One look into the eyeless face of Death turns me to ashes . I am no longer fit for love . . . . She turns to the door . Why does he not come for his answer ? She looks for a lingering moment toward the door , and then turns back again to the table . Her mood changes again . A present from a husband to a wife ! She takes it up in her hands . A lady 's mirror ! What was it that he said ? “ Look long and well into this mirror , and profit by what you see , ” My mirror from the Catacombs ! She sinks into a chair , holding it between her hands as it rests on the table . Her tone is trance-like .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>I look . I see the end of all things . I see that nothing matters . Is that your message ? Why do you grin at me ? You laugh to think that my face is like your face — or will be soon — in a few years-tomorrow . You mock at me for thinking I am alive . I am dead , you say . Dead , like you . Am I ? She rises .</stage>
     <stage>No . Not yet . For a moment — a little lifetime — I have life , I Have lips and eyelids made for kisses . I have hands that burn to give caresses , and breasts that ache to take them . I have a body made to suffer the deep stings of love . This flesh of mine shall be a golden web woven of pain and joy . She takes up the skull again . You were alive once , and a virgin-martyr ? You denied yourself love ? You sent away your lover ? No wonder you speak so plainly to me now . Back , girl , to your coffin ! She puts the skull in the box , and closes the lid softly . She turns to the door and waits . At last he enters .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>dejected</stage>You have — decided ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Yes . I have decided .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>I knew . It is no use . I will go . He turns to the door .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Wait !<stage>He turns back incredulously .</stage>I have decided to go with you .<stage>He stands stock-still .</stage>Do n't you understand ? Take me . I am yours . Do n't you believe it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Violante !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>It is hard to believe , is n't it . I have been a child . Now I am a woman . And shall I tell you how I became a woman ?<stage>She points to the box on the table .</stage>I looked in my mirror there . I saw that I was beautiful — and alive . Tell me , am I not beautiful — and alive ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>There is something terrible about you at this moment . I am almost afraid of you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Kiss me , Luciano !</p>

      <stage>The cherry-orchard scene was effectively produced on a small stage by a blue-green back-drop with a single conventionalized cherry-branch painted across it , and two three-leaved screens masking the wings , painted in blue-green with a spray of cherry blossoms .</stage>
      <stage>A corner of the cherry orchard on the country place of the late Mr. Boggley , now on sale and open for inspection to prospective buyers . The cherry orchard , now in full bloom , is a very pleasant place . There is a green-painted rustic bench beside the path . . . .</stage>
      <stage>A young woman , dressed in a light summer frock and carrying a parasol , drifts in from the back . She sees the bench , comes over to it and sits down with an air of petulant weariness .</stage>
      <stage>A handsome young man enters from the right . He stops short in surprise on seeing the charming stranger who lolls upon the bench . He takes off his hat .</stage>
     </stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Oh , I beg your pardon !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Oh , you need n't ! I 've no right to be here , either .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>coming over to her</stage>Now what do you mean by that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>I thought perhaps you were playing truant , as I am .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Playing truant ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>I was looking at the house , you know . And I got tired and ran away .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Well , to tell the truth , so did I . It 's dull work , is n't it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>I 've been upstairs and down for two hours . That family portrait gallery finished me . It was so old and gloomy and dead that I felt as if I were dead myself . I just had to do something . I wanted to jab my parasol through the window-pane . I understood just how the suffragettes felt . But I was afraid of shocking the agent . He is such a meek little man , and he seemed to think so well of me . If I had broken the window I would have shattered his ideals of womanhood , too , I 'm afraid . So I just slipped away quietly and came here .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>I 've only been there half an hour and we — I 've only been in the basement . That 's why our tours of inspection did n't bring us together sooner . I 've been cross-examining the furnace . Do you understand furnaces ?<stage>He sits down beside her</stage>I do n't .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Do you like family portraits ? I hate ‘ em !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>What ! Do the family portraits go with the house ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>No , thank heaven . They 've been bequeathed to some museum , I am told . They 're valuable historically — early colonial governors and all that sort of stuff . But there is some one with me who — who takes a deep interest in such things .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>frowning at a sudden memory</stage>Hm . Did n't I see you at that real estate office in New York yesterday ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Yes . He was with me then .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>compassionately</stage>I — I thought I remembered seeing you with — with him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>cheerfully</stage>Is n't he just the sort of man who would be interested in family portraits ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>confused</stage>Well — since you ask me —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Oh , that 's all right . Tubby 's a dear , in spite of his funny old ideas . I like him very much .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>gulping the pill</stage>Yes ....</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>He 's so anxious to please me in buying this house . I suppose it 's all right to have a house , but I 'd like to become acquainted with it gradually . I 'd like to feel that there was always some corner left to explore — some mystery saved up for a rainy day . Tubby can n't understand that . He drags me everywhere , explaining how we 'll keep this and change that — dormer windows here and perhaps a new wing there .... I suppose you 've been rebuilding the house , too ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>No . Merely decided to turn that sunny south room into a study . It would make a very pleasant place to work . But if you really want the place , I 'd hate to take it away from you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>I was just going to say that if you really wanted it , I 'd withdraw . It was Tubby 's idea to buy it , you know — not mine . You do want it , do n't you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>I can n't say that I do . It 's so infernally big . But Maria thinks I ought to have it .<stage>Explanatorily</stage>— Maria is —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>gently</stage>She 's — the one who is interested in furnaces . I understand . I saw her with you at the real-estate office yesterday . Well — furnaces are necessary , I suppose .<stage>There is a pause , which she breaks suddenly .</stage>Do you see that bee ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>A bee ? He follows her gaze up to a cluster of blossoms .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Yes — there !<stage>Affectionately</stage>— The rascal ! There he goes . Their eyes follow the flight of the bee across the orchard . There is a silence . Alone together beneath the blossoms , a spell seems to have fallen upon them . She tries to think of something to say — and at last succeeds .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Have you heard the story of the people who used to live here ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>No ; why ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>The agent was telling us . It 's quite romantic — and rather sad . You see , the man that built this house was in love with a girl . He was building it for her — as a surprise . But he had neglected to mention to her that he was in love with her . And so , in pique , she married another man , though she was really in love with him . The news came just when he had finished the house . He shut it up for a year or two , but eventually married some one else , and they lived I here for ten years — most unhappily . Then they went abroad , and the house was sold . It was bought , curiously enough , by the husband of the girl he had been in love with . They lived here till they died-hating each other to the end , the agent says .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>It gives me the shivers . To think of that house , haunted by the memories of wasted love ! Which of us , I wonder , will have to live in it ? I do n't want to .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>prosaically</stage>Oh , do n't take it so seriously as all that . If one can n't live in a house where there 's been an unhappy marriage , why , good heavens , where is one going to live ? Most marriages , I fancy , are unhappy .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>A bitter philosophy for one so young and —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Nonsense ! But listen to the rest of the story . The most interesting part is about this very orchard .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Really !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Yes . This orchard , it seems , was here before the house was . It was part of an old farm where he and she — the unhappy lovers , you know — stopped one day , while they were out driving , and asked for something to eat . The farmer 's wife was busy , but she gave them each a glass of milk , and told them they could eat all the cherries they wanted . So they picked a hatful of cherries , and ate them , sitting on a bench like this one . And then he fell in love with her . . . .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>And . . . did n't tell her so . . . . She glances at him in alarm . His self-possession has vanished . He is pale and frightened , but there is a desperate look in his eyes , as if some unknown power were forcing him to do something very rash . In short , he seems like a young man who has just fallen in love .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>hastily</stage>So you see this orchard is haunted , too !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>I feel it . I seem to hear the ghost of that old-time lover whispering to me . . . .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>provocatively</stage>Indeed ! What does he say ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>He says : “ I was a coward ; you must be bold . I was silent ; you must speak out . ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>mischievously</stage>That 's very curious — because that old lover is n't dead at all . He 's a Congressman or Senator or something , the Agent says .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>earnestly</stage>It 's all the same . His youth is dead ; and it is his youth that speaks to me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>quickly You must n't believe all that ghosts tell you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Oh , but I must . For they know the folly of silence — the bitterness of cowardice .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>The circumstances were — slightly — different , were n't they ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>stubbornly</stage>I do n't care !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>soberly</stage>You know perfectly well it 's no use .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>I can n't help that !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Please ! You simply must n't ! It 's disgraceful !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>What 's disgraceful ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>confused</stage>What you are going to say .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>simply</stage>Only that I love you . What is there disgraceful about that ? It 's beautiful !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>It 's wrong .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>It 's inevitable .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Why inevitable ? Ca n't you talk with a girl in an orchard for half an hour without falling in love with her ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Not if the girl is you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>But why especially me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>I do n't know . Love — is a mystery . I only know that I was destined to love you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>How can you be so sure ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Because you have changed the world for me . It 's as though I had been groping about in the dark , and then — sunrise ! And there 's a queer feeling here .<stage>He puts his hand on his heart .</stage>To tell the honest truth , there 's a still queerer feeling in the pit of my stomach . It 's a gone feeling , if you must know . And my knees are weak . I know now why men used to fall on their knees when they told a girl they loved her ; it was because they could n't stand up . And there 's a feeling in my feet as though I were walking on air . And —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>faintly</stage>That 's enough !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>And I could die for you and be glad of the chance . It 's perfectly absurd , but it 's absolutely true . I 've never spoken to you before , and heaven knows I may never get a chance to speak to you again , but I 'd never forgive myself if I did n't say this to you now . I love you ! love you ! love you ! Now tell me I 'm a fool . Tell me to go . Anything — I 've said my say . . . . Why do n't you speak ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>I — I 've nothing to say — except — except that I — well —<stage>almost inaudibly</stage>I feel some of those symptoms myself .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ME</speaker>
      <p><stage>triumphantly</stage>You love me !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>I — do n't know . Yes . Perhaps .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Then kiss me !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>doubtfully</stage>No . . . .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Kiss me !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>tormentedly</stage>Oh , what 's the use ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>I do n't know . I do n't care . I only know that we love each other .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>after a moment 's hesitation , desperately</stage>I do n't care , either ! I do want to kiss you .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>She does . . . . He is the first to awake from the ecstasy .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>It is wrong —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>absently</stage>Is it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>But , oh heaven ! kiss me again !<stage>She does .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Darling !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Do you suppose any one is likely to come this way ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>No .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>speculatively</stage>Your husband is probably still in the portrait gallery ....</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>My husband !<stage>Drawing away</stage>What do you mean ?<stage>Thoroughly awake now</stage>You did n't think —?<stage>She jumps up and laughs convulsively .</stage>You thought poor old Tubby was my husband ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>staring up at her bewildered</stage>Why , is n't he your husband ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>scornfully</stage>No !! He 's my uncle !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Your unc —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Yes , of course !<stage>Indignantly</stage>Do you suppose I would be married to a man that 's fat and bald and forty years old ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>distressed</stage>I — I beg your pardon . I did think so .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Just because you saw me with him ? How ridiculous !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>It was a silly mistake . But — the things you said ! You spoke so — realistically — about marriage .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>It was your marriage I was speaking about .<stage>With hasty compunction</stage>Oh , I beg your —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>My marriage !<stage>He rises .</stage>Good heavens ! And to whom , pray , did you think I was married ?<stage>A light dawning</stage>To Maria ? Why , Maria is my aunt !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Yes — of course . How stupid of me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Let 's get this straight . Are you married to anybody ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Certainly not . As if I would let myself be made love to , if I were a married woman !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Now do n't put on airs . You did something quite as improper . You made love to a married man .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>I did n't .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>It 's the same thing . You thought I was married .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>But you are n't .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>No . I 'm not married . And — and — you 're not married .<stage>The logic of the situation striking him all of a sudden</stage>In fact —! He pauses , rather alarmed .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Yes ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>In fact — well — there 's no reason in the world why we should n't make love to each other !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>equally startled</stage>Why — that 's so !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Then — then — shall we ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>sitting down and looking demurely at her toes</stage>Oh , not if you do n't want to !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>adjusting himself to the situation</stage>Well — under the circumstances — I suppose I ought to begin by asking you to marry me . .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>languidly , with a provoking glance</stage>You do n't seem very anxious to .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>feeling at a disadvantage</stage>It is n't that — but — well —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>lightly</stage>Well what ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Dash it all , I do n't know your name !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>looking at him with mild curiosity</stage>That did n't seem to stop you a while ago ....</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>doggedly</stage>Well , then — will you marry me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>promptly</stage>No .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>surprised</stage>No ! Why do you say that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>coolly</stage>Why should I marry you ? I know nothing about you . I 've known you for less than an hour .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>sardonically</stage>That fact did n't seem to keep you from kissing me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Besides — I do n't like the way you go about it . If you 'd propose the same way you made love to me , maybe I 'd accept you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>All right .<stage>Dropping on one knee before her</stage>Beloved !<stage>An awkward pause</stage>No , I can n't do it .<stage>He gets up and distractedly dusts off his knees with his handkerchief .</stage>I 'm very sorry .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>with calm inquiry</stage>Perhaps it 's because you do n't love me any more ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>fretfully</stage>Of course I love you !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>coldly</stage>But you do n't want to marry me .... I see .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Not at all ! I do want to marry you . But —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Well ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Marriage is a serious matter . Now do n't take offense ! I only meant that-well —<stage>He starts again .</stage>We are in love with each other , and that 's the important thing . But , as you said , we do n't know each other . I 've no doubt that when we get acquainted we will like each other better still . But we 've got to get acquainted first .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>rising</stage>You 're just like Tubby buying a house . You want to know all about it . Well ! I warn you that you 'll never know all about me . So you need n't try .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>apologetically</stage>It was your suggestion .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>impatiently</stage>Oh , all right ! Go ahead and cross-examine me if you like . I 'll tell you to begin with that I 'm perfectly healthy , and that there 's no T. B ., insanity , or Socialism in my family . What else do you want to know ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>hesitantly</stage>Why did you put in Socialism , along with insanity and T. B .?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Oh , just for fun . You are n't a Socialist , are you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Yes .<stage>Earnestly</stage>Do you know what Socialism is ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>innocently</stage>It 's the same thing as Anarchy , is n't it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>gently</stage>No . At least not my kind . I believe in municipal ownership of street cars , and all that sort of thing . I 'll give you some books to read .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Well , I never ride in street cars , so I do n't care whether they 're municipally owned or not . By the way , do you dance ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>No .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>You must learn right away . I can n't bother to teach you myself , but I know where you can get private lessons and become really good in a month . It is stupid not to be able to dance .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>as if he had tasted quinine</stage>I can see myself doing the tango ! Grr !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>The tango went out long ago , my dear .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>with great decision</stage>Well — I wo n't learn to dance . You might as well know that to begin with .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>And I wo n't read your old books on Socialism . You might as well know that to begin with !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>Come , come ! This will never do . You see , my dear , it 's simply that</l>
       <l>I can n't dance , and there 's no use for me to try to learn .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Anybody can learn . I 've made expert dancers out of the awkwardest men !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>But , you see , I 've no inclination toward dancing . It 's out of my world .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>And I 've no inclination toward municipal ownership . It 's out of my world !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>It ought not to be out of the world of any intelligent person .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>turning her back on him</stage>All right — if you want to call me stupid !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>turning and looking away meditatively</stage>It appears that we have very few tastes in common .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>tapping her foot</stage>So it seems .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>If we married we might be happy for a month —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Perhaps . They remain with their backs to each other .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>And then — the old story . Quarrels . . . .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>I never could bear quarrels . . . .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>An unhappy marriage . . . .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>realizing it</stage>Oh !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>hopelessly turning toward her</stage>I can n't marry you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>recovering quickly and facing him with a smile</stage>Nobody asked you , sir !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a gesture of finality</stage>Well — there seems to be no more to say .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>sweetly</stage>Except good-bye .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>firmly</stage>Good-by , then . He holds out his hand .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>taking it</stage>Good-bye !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>taking her other hand — after a pause , helplessly</stage>Good-bye !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>drowning in his eyes</stage>Good-bye ! They cling to each other , and are presently lost in a passionate embrace . He breaks loose and stamps away , then turns to her .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Damn it all , we do love each other !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>wiping her eyes</stage>What a pity that is the only taste we have in common !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Do you suppose that is enough ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>I wish it were !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>A month of happiness —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Yes !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>And then — wretchedness ,</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>No — never !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>We must n't do it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>I suppose not .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Come , let us control ourselves .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Yes , let 's<stage>They take hands again .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>with an effort</stage>I wish you happiness . I — I 'll go to Europe for a year . Try to forget me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>I shall be married when you get back — perhaps .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>I hope it 's somebody that 's not bald and fat and forty . Otherwise —!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>And you — for goodness sake ! marry a girl that 's very young and very , very pretty . That will help .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>We must n't prolong this . If we stay together another minute —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Then go !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>I can n't go !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>You must , darling ! You must !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Oh , if somebody would only come along ! They are leaning toward each other , dizzy upon the brink of another kiss , when somebody does come — a short , mild-looking man in a derby hat . There is an odd gleam in his eyes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE INTRUDER</speaker>
      <p><stage>startled</stage>Excuse me ! They turn and stare at him , but their hands cling fast to each other .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>faintly</stage>The Agent !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE AGENT</speaker>
      <p><stage>in despairing accents</stage>Too late ! Too late !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE YOUNG MAN</speaker>
      <p>No ! Just in time !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE AGENT</speaker>
      <p>Too late , I say ! I will go . He turns away .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE YOUNG MAN</speaker>
      <p>No ! Stay !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE AGENT</speaker>
      <p>What 's the use ? It has already begun . What good can I do now ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE YOUNG MAN</speaker>
      <p>I 'll show you what good you can do now . Come here !<stage>The Agent approaches .</stage>, Can you unloose my hands from those of this young woman ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE YOUNG WOMAN</speaker>
      <p><stage>haughtily , releasing herself and walking away</stage>You need n't trouble ! I can do it myself .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE YOUNG MAN</speaker>
      <p>Thank you . It was utterly beyond my power .<stage>To the Agent</stage>— Will you kindly take hold of me and move me over there ?<stage>The Agent propels him away from the girl .</stage>Thank you . At this distance I can perhaps say farewell in a seemly and innocuous manner .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE AGENT</speaker>
      <p>Young man , you will not say farewell to that young lady for ten days-and perhaps never !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE YOUNG WOMAN</speaker>
      <p>What !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE AGENT</speaker>
      <p>They have arranged it all .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE YOUNG MAN</speaker>
      <p>Who have arranged what ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE AGENT</speaker>
      <p>Your aunt , Miss Brooke — and<stage>to the young woman</stage>your uncle , Mr. Egerton — The young people turn and stare at each other in amazement .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE YOUNG MAN</speaker>
      <p>Egerton ! Are you Helen Egerton ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HELEN</speaker>
      <p>And are you George Brooke ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE AGENT</speaker>
      <p>Your aunt and uncle have just discovered each other up at the house , and they have arranged for you all to take dinner together tonight , and then go to a ten-day house-party at Mr. Egerton 's place on Long Island .<stage>Grimly</stage>The reason of all this will be plain to you . They want you two to get married .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <p>Then we 're done for ! We 'll have to get married now whether we want to or not !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HELEN</speaker>
      <p>What ! Just to please them ? I sha n't do it !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <p><stage>gloomily</stage>You do n't know my Aunt Maria .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HELEN</speaker>
      <p>And Tubby will try to bully me , I suppose . But I wo n't do it — no matter what he says !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE AGENT</speaker>
      <p>Pardon what may seem an impertinence , Miss ; but is it really true that you do n't want to marry this young man ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HELEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>flaming</stage>I suppose because you saw me in his arms —! Oh , I want to , all right , but —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE AGENT</speaker>
      <p><stage>mildly</stage>Then what seems to be the trouble ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HELEN</speaker>
      <p>I — oh , you explain to him , George . She goes to the bench and sits down .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <p>Well , it 's this way . As you may have deduced from what you saw , we are madly in love with each other —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HELEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>from the bench</stage>But I 'm not madly in love with municipal ownership . That 's the chief difficulty .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <p>No , the chief difficulty is that I refuse to entertain even a platonic affection for the tango .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HELEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>irritably</stage>I told you the tango had gone out long ago !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <p>Well , then , the maxixe .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HELEN</speaker>
      <p>Stupid !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <p>And there you have it ! No doubt it seems ridiculous to you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE AGENT</speaker>
      <p><stage>gravely</stage>Not at all , my boy . I 've known marriage to go to smash on far less than that . When you come to think of it , a taste for dancing and a taste for municipal ownership stand at the two ends of the earth away from each other . They represent two different ways of taking life . And if two people who live in the same house can n't agree on those two things , they 'd disagree on a hundred things that came up every day . And what 's the use for two different kinds of beings to try to live together ? It does n't work , no matter how much , love there is between them .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <p><stage>rushing up to him in surprise and gratification , and shaking his hand warmly</stage>Then you 're on our side ! You 'll help us not to get married !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE AGENT</speaker>
      <p>Your aunt is very set on it — and your uncle , too , Miss !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HELEN</speaker>
      <p>We must find some way to get out of it , or they 'll have us cooped up together in that house before we know it .<stage>Rising and coming over to the Agent</stage>Ca n't you think up some scheme ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE AGENT</speaker>
      <p>Perhaps I can , and perhaps I can n't . I 'm a bachelor myself , Miss , and that means that I 've thought up many a scheme to get out of marriage myself .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HELEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>outraged</stage>You old scoundrel !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE AGENT</speaker>
      <p>Oh , it 's not so bad as you may think , Miss . I 've always gone through the marriage ceremony to please them . But that 's not what I call marriage .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <p>Then what do you call marriage ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HELEN</speaker>
      <p>Yes , I 'd like to know !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE AGENT</speaker>
      <p>Marriage , my young friends , is an iniquitous arrangement devised by the Devil himself for driving all the love out of the hearts of lovers . They start out as much in love with each other as you two are today , and they end by being as sick of the sight of each other as you two will be five years hence if I do n't find a way of saving you alive out of the Devil 's own trap . It 's not lack of love that 's the trouble with marriage — it 's marriage itself . And when I say marriage , I do n't mean promising to love , honour , and obey , for richer , for poorer , in sickness and in health till death do you part — that 's only human nature to wish and to attempt . And it might be done if it were n't for the iniquitous arrangement of marriage .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <p><stage>puzzled</stage>But what is the iniquitous arrangement ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE AGENT</speaker>
      <p>Ah , that 's the trouble ! If I tell you , you wo n't believe me . You 'll go ahead and try it out , and find out what all the unhappy ones have found out before you . Listen to me , my children . Did you ever go on a picnic ?<stage>He looks from one to the other — they stand astonished and silent .</stage>Of course you have . Every one has . There is an instinct in us which makes us go back to the ways of our savage ancestors — to gather about a fire in the forest , to cook meat on a pointed stick , and eat it with our fingers . But how many books would you write , young man , if you had to go back to the campfire every day for your lunch ? And how many new dances would you invent if you lived eternally in the picnic stage of civilization ? No ! the picnic is incompatible with everyday living . As incompatible as marriage .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <p>But —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HELEN</speaker>
      <p>But —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE AGENT</speaker>
      <p>Marriage is the nest-building instinct , turned by the Devil himself into an institution to hold the human soul in chains . The whole story of marriage is told in the old riddle : “ Why do birds in their nests agree ? Because if they do n't , they 'll fall out . ” That 's it . Marriage is a nest so small that there is no room in it for disagreement . Now it may be all right for birds to agree , but human beings are not built that way . They disagree , and home becomes a little hell . Or else they do agree , at the expense of the soul 's freedom stifled in one or both .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HELEN</speaker>
      <p>Yes , but tell me —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <p>Ssh !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE AGENT</speaker>
      <p>Yet there is the nest-building instinct . You feel it , both of you . If you do n't now , you will as soon as you are married . If you are fools , you will try to live all your lives in a love-nest ; and you will imprison your souls within it , and the Devil will laugh .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HELEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>to George</stage>I am beginning to be afraid of him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <p>So am I .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE AGENT</speaker>
      <p>If you are wise , you will build yourselves a little nest secretly in the woods , away from civilization , and you will run away together to that nest whenever you are in the mood . A nest so small that it will hold only two beings and one thought — the thought of love . And then you will come back refreshed to civilization , where every soul is different from every other soul — you will let each other alone , forget each other , and do your own work in peace . Do you understand ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HELEN</speaker>
      <p>He means we should occupy separate sides of the house , I think . Or else that we should live apart and only see each other on week-ends . I 'm not sure which .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE AGENT</speaker>
      <p><stage>passionately</stage>I mean that you should not stifle love with civilization , nor encumber civilization with love . What have they to do with each other ? You think you want a fellow student of economics . You are wrong . You think you want a dancing partner . You are mistaken . You want a revelation of the glory of the universe .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HELEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>to George , confidentially</stage>It 's blithering nonsense , of course . But it was something like that — a while ago .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <p><stage>bewilderedly</stage>Yes ; when we knew it was our first kiss and thought it was to be our last .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE AGENT</speaker>
      <p><stage>fiercely</stage>A kiss is always the first kiss and the last — or it is nothing .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HELEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>conclusively</stage>He 's quite mad .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <p>Absolutely .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE AGENT</speaker>
      <p>Mad ? Of course I am mad . But — He turns suddenly , and subsides as a man in a , guard 's uniform enters .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GUARD</speaker>
      <p>Ah , here you are ! Thought you 'd given us the slip , did you ?<stage>To the others</stage>Escaped from the Asylum , he did , a week ago , and got a job here . We 've been huntin ’ him high and low . Come along now !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <p><stage>recovering with difficulty the power of speech</stage>What — what 's the matter with him ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GUARD</speaker>
      <p>Matter with him ? He went crazy , he did , readin ’ the works of Bernard Shaw . And if he was n't in the insane asylum he 'd be in jail . He 's a bigamist , he is . He married fourteen women . But none of ‘ em would go on the witness stand against him . Said he was an ideal husband , they did . Fourteen of ‘ em ! But otherwise he 's perfectly harmless .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE AGENT</speaker>
      <p><stage>pleasantly</stage>Perfectly harmless ! Yes , perfectly harmless ! He is led out .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HELEN</speaker>
      <p>That explains it all !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <p>Yes — and yet I feel there was something in what he was saying .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HELEN</speaker>
      <p>Well — are we going to get married or not ? We 've got to decide that before we face my uncle and your aunt .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <p>Of course we 'll get married . You have your work and I mine , and —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HELEN</speaker>
      <p>Well , if we do , then you can n't have that sunny south room for a study . I want it for the nursery .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
      <p>The nursery !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HELEN</speaker>
      <p>Yes ; babies , you know !</p>

     <stage type="setting">
      <stage>The courtyard of a palace . On one side , broad steps , and a door , leading to the palace . On the other , steps leading downward . At the back , a rose-arbour , and in front of it a wide seat .</stage>
      <stage>On the steps before the door a fool is sitting , plucking at a musical instrument . On the lower steps stands an old woman , richly dressed .</stage>
     </stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE OLD WOMAN</speaker>
      <p>Why do you sit there , fool , and twang at that harp ? There 's no occasion for making music . Nobody has been winning any battles . How long has it been since a great fight was heard of ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>If there had been a battle , old woman , they would have had to get some one besides myself to celebrate the winning of it . I do not like fighting .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE OLD WOMAN</speaker>
      <p>What does a scrawny little weakling like you know of fighting , and why should you have an opinion ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>The days of fighting are over , and a good thing it is , too . Four kingdoms we have about us , that in the bloody old days we would be for ever marching against , and they against us , killing and burning and destroying the crops till a quiet man would be sick to think of it . But that 's all past . Twenty years we have been at peace with them , and that 's ever since the young queen was born , and I hope it may last as long as she lives .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE OLD WOMAN</speaker>
      <p>There 's no stopping a fool when he starts to talk . But it is right you are that the good old days are gone . Those were the days of great heroes , like the father of her that is now Queen . They were fine men that stood beside him , and one was my own man . I said to him , “ This is the time a brave man is sure to be killed . If you come back to me , I 'll always think you were a coward . ” He died along with a thousand of the best men in the kingdom fighting around the King . That was a great day . Four kingdoms at once we fought , and beat them to their knees . Glad enough they were to make peace with the child of that dead king .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>Spare me , woman . I 've heard that old story often enough . What do you suppose all that fighting was for , if it was n't to put an end to quarrelling for all time ? If the old King was alive now , he 'd sit in his palace and drink his ale and listen to music , and when he saw the young men giving kisses to the young women under the trees he 'd be glad enough . But you still go cawing for blood , like an old crow .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE OLD WOMAN</speaker>
      <p>I 'll not talk to such a one . You can see with your own eyes that our enemies are strong and prosperous . We let them into the kingdom with their silks and their satins and their jewels to sell . They walk about the city here and laugh to themselves , thinking how they will spoil and destroy everything soon . It may be this year , it may be next year . If the old King were alive , he 'd never have let them get half so strong . He would have kept them in fear of us , and trained up a fine band of heroes , too , making raids on them once in a while . There 's the city that shoves itself right up against our borders — I can see our men coming home from the spoiling of it , all red with spilt wine and blood . . . .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>You 're a disgusting old woman . If I hear any more of that talk , I 'm likely to slap the face of you , even if you are the Queen 's nurse . Go away before you spoil my afternoon .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE OLD WOMAN</speaker>
      <p>I could speak to the Queen and have you beaten , do you know that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>Woman , go away . I do not want to be bothered by the old and the garrulous . I am composing a love-song .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE OLD WOMAN</speaker>
      <p>Has any one ever loved you , I would like to know ? Now if it were that young prince who is staying with us , he would have some right to make love-songs — if what they say is true , that every woman he meets on his journey falls in love with him . Even our own Queen , I am thinking . But only three days does he stay in any place , and then he is up and gone on his long journey that nobody understands the reason or the end of , from the east to the west . He is too wise to be held by such toys as love .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>Then he is more a fool than I .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE OLD WOMAN</speaker>
      <p>Who should know about love , if not a man who has been loved by many women and by great queens ? But you , what do you know about it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>The trouble with the old is that they forget so many things . I am sorry for you , woman . You think yourself wise , but the fool that sits at the Queen 's doorstep and looks at her as she passes , and she never seeing him at all , is wiser than you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE OLD WOMAN</speaker>
      <p>I have wasted enough words with you . I will go away and sit in the sun and think of the days when there were heroes . She goes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>And I will make a song about love . I will make a song about the love that is too high for pride and too deep for shame . The door has opened , and the young Queen stands looking down at him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>What is that , fool ? What are the words you are saying ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p><stage>kneeling</stage>I was speaking of a love that is too high for pride and too deep for shame .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>And whose love is that , fool ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>It is the love of all who really love , and it is the only love worth making a song about .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>smiling</stage>And how do you come to be so wise as to know about such things ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>I know because I am a fool .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>I am well answered . And you are not the only fool in the world , I am thinking . But tell me , fool , have you seen any of the Prince 's men here ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>No , but I have heard that the ship is being got ready for sailing . . . .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>rebukingly</stage>I did not ask you that .<stage>She is about to go , but turns back , and gives him a piece of money .</stage>This is for you to buy wine with and get drunken . You are not amusing when you are sober .<stage>She starts to go , but turns again .</stage>Fool , do you believe in magic ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>I have heard that the old wizard who lives in a cave down by the shore is able to rouse storms and keep vessels from sailing .....</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>looking at him , for a moment fixedly</stage>I have a great mind to have you poisoned . Here , take this , and remember that I said to be drunken . She gives him another piece of money , and goes off by way of the rose-trellised passage-way . A sailor comes up the steps .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE SAILOR</speaker>
      <p>Fool , where is the Prince ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>I do not know , sailor , but I can tell you what I think .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE SAILOR</speaker>
      <p>What difference does it make what you think ? I have a message to deliver to him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>I think that the Queen has sung him to sleep , and that he has not yet awakened .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE SAILOR</speaker>
      <p>It is likely enough . But I have been sent by the captain , and I must see him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>You look hot .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE SAILOR</speaker>
      <p>I am so hot and thirsty that I could drink a barrelful of wine . It is well enough for the Prince to lie about and eat and drink and be sung to by pretty women , but we sailors have work to do . This business of staying only three days in each port disgusts me . No sooner do we get ashore than we have to go back on board again . I saw a girl yesterday , a beauty , and not afraid of a man . There must be many like that here , but what good does it do me ? I spent all my money on her , and now I can n't even get a drink . It 's a shame .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>Would you like a drink ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE SAILOR</speaker>
      <p>Fool , do n't make a mock of my thirst , or I 'll twist your neck .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>Look at this .<stage>Shows him a coin .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE SAILOR</speaker>
      <p>What a piece of luck ! Is it real money ? Where did you get it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>Your prince gave it to me , and said I was to treat any of his sailors that I came across .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE SAILOR</speaker>
      <p>Then it 's all right . Why did n't you say so before ? Come along . If you were as thirsty as I am —! They go down the steps . The door opens , and the Prince comes out . He looks up and down .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>And now begins again my long journey from the east to the west . . . . The old woman appears .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE OLD WOMAN</speaker>
      <p>Well , have you waked at last ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>You are a bitter-tongued old woman . But for all that , I think you are my friend . Perhaps the only friend I have here .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE OLD WOMAN</speaker>
      <p>You are right . For all that you sleep your holiday away , you are a brave man . And I am the only one in this kingdom that thinks well of bravery . The rest want to smother it with kisses .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>True enough . I feel that already I am becoming soft . Never before have I been unwilling to leave a city —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE OLD WOMAN</speaker>
      <p>Or a Queen . . . .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>I must go on board ship . Is it ready , I wonder ? The captain promised to send word to me . . . .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE OLD WOMAN</speaker>
      <p>Yes , it is time you went , before they have made a lapdog of you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>You speak very freely . Are you not afraid of the Queen ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE OLD WOMAN</speaker>
      <p>She does not know what she is doing . She has grown up in a base time of peace , and she does not understand that it is not a man 's business to sleep and drink wine and exchange kisses with pretty queens . She would turn you from your purpose —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>My purpose ? What do you know of my purpose ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE OLD WOMAN</speaker>
      <p>I have not guessed your secret . But I know that you are not merely taking a pleasure journey . I have seen heroes , and you have the eyes of one . The end of all this journeying from the east to the west is something great and terrible — and I will not have you turned aside .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>Something great and terrible .... Yes ....</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE OLD WOMAN</speaker>
      <p>You have the look of one who does not care for rest or peace or the love of a woman for more than a day . But there is a weakness in you , too . If you would go , go quickly .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>I wonder why the sailor does not come . It looks like a storm . The sky has become ominously dark .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE OLD WOMAN</speaker>
      <p>Would a storm hold you back ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>Is that what you think of me , old woman ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE OLD WOMAN</speaker>
      <p>Well , we shall see what stuff you are made of .... She shuffles off . The Queen enters .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>coming up to him , tenderly</stage>When did you wake ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>Did you think your voice had enough magic in it to make me sleep till you returned ? We have just time to say farewell .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>There is a storm coming up . Do you see how black the sky is ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>I am not afraid of storms .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>Of course you are not afraid of storms . Did you think you had to prove your bravery ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>The three days are over .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>And how quickly !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>I told you I could stay only three days .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>I thought you were a king , and could do whatever you chose ....</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>I have chosen to stay only three days .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>In what way have I offended you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>I made my choice long ago , before I knew you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>And now you are afraid to change your mind ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>Do you think a brave man changes his mind for pleasure 's sake ?</p>
     </sp>

      <p>Forgive me . If it is your happiness to go on , to what end I do not know , I will let you . I do not wish to make you unhappy . But I would give you something to take with you , one more flower of my garden , an unfading rose that shall be like a bright memory of me in your heart always . Will you take it ? She leads him back into the palace . The sailor enters , supported by the fool .</p>

      <p>So you said . But you have n't finished telling me about that girl . Her eyes were blue , you said .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE SAILOR</speaker>
      <p>Blue , yes . If I said blue , then blue it was . Or maybe green , or grey . Maybe I 'm . thinking of the hussy back in the last port we stopped at . It 's all the same . Reminds me of a little song . Shall I sing you a little song ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

     <sp>
      <speaker>THE SAILOR</speaker>
      <p>And there you are ! If I do say it myself , I have as good a time as the Prince does . One girl 's as nice as another — and maybe nicer , at that . What 's a Queen ? Can she kiss better than any other girl ? I 've wondered a bit about it . And the conclusion I 've come to is ... the conclusion I 've come to ...</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>The conclusion you 've come to is —?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE SAILOR</speaker>
      <p>Right you are . Give me that flagon . That 's the stuff . What was I saying ? The conclusion I 've come to is that the Prince can n't have any more fun in three days than any other man . Queen or no Queen . Am I right ? Tell me , am I right ?</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>THE SAILOR</speaker>
      <p>No . Of course you would n't . You 're a good fellow . You 're my friend . Where 's that flagon ? Ah ! And now it 's your turn to sing . Sing that little song you sang a while ago . That was a good one . You sing almost as well as I do .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE SAILOR</speaker>
      <p>No , no , not that one ! That one has n't any tune to it , and it is n't about girls . It 's no song at all . I meant the one — you know — about the young widow . How did it go ?<stage>He swigs from the flagon .</stage>But I must n't forget the Prince . Where 's that Prince ?</p>

       <stage>He leads the sailor off through the rose-arbour . The door of the palace opens , disclosing the Prince and the Queen .</stage>

      <p>What is that you say ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>I say that it is enough that you should think of me sometimes on your long journey from the east to the west . To be remembered — that is the portion of women .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>You knew what manner of man I was , and that I would not be detained . Why , if you must have the taste of kisses on your lips always , did you not turn to some man of your own land , who would not stray from your side ? Why did you give your love to one you had never seen before , and will never see again ? I did not ask that you love me . What you gave , I took .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>I regret nothing that I have given . But I am sorry for you , because you do not understand .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>It may be that I do not understand . But I know that I may not stay longer in this place . Would you ask me to do otherwise ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>I would not ask you , no . If you understood , I would have no need of asking . If all things in your life have not changed colour and significance — if I have been to you but as a harlot to one of your sailors ,— then leave me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p><stage>confusedly</stage>It is not true that nothing has changed . My mind is in a turmoil . I am dizzy , I cannot see . I have almost forgotten why I set my heart on this journey . You have bewitched me , and that is why I fear you . If I stay here with you any longer , I shall forget everything . I must go .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>It is too late . You are mine , now , mine for ever . It was for this that you came hither — I am the meaning of your journey . It was ordained that you love me . You must not think of anything else .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>Why have you done this to me ? Are you a witch ? I am afraid of you ! He rises .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>I will teach you strange and terrible secrets .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>I fear you and yet I trust you . What will come of this I do not know . But I care for nothing . Nothing in the world means anything to me now except you . Why is it that I seem to hate you ? He seizes her and holds her fiercely .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>That is because you love me at last .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>I could kill you .</p>
     </sp>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>Why did I try to keep the man you love from going away ? In the hope that one day I should see you kissing him in the garden , and thus I would be spared the trouble of killing myself . In a word , I am a fool . But I have tried to help you . Why did you not keep him ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>I have been asking that question of my own heart , fool . I would that I had not come to him a virgin and a Queen , but a light woman skilled in all the ways of love . Then perhaps I could have held him . But now he is gone , and the world is black .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>It is not the world , it is your heart that is black . And it is black with hatred . . . .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>I think you understand , fool . I would set fire to this palace which the King my father built , I would burn it down tonight , save that it would not make light enough to take away the blackness from my heart . The sailor again , staggering .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>

      <p>I have been poisoned .<stage>He puts his hand to his side .</stage>I am dying . But first —! He draws a short sword , and runs at her .

      <p>No — my heart is already aching with its emptiness again .... What shall I do ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>You might poison me , too . I think I would die in a more original manner than that silly sailor . Yes , I would seize you in my arms and kiss you before I died .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>That would be amusing . But it is a pity to waste kisses on a dying man . And besides , you are the only one in my kingdom who understands me . I must have you alive to talk to .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>There are strange stories about the kisses of queens .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>Tell them to me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>There is an old saying that three kisses bestowed by a queen upon a fool will make a hero of him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>That might be interesting . I think I will try it . Come to me , do not be afraid . This day I have given my kisses to a man who thought no more of them than that dead sailor there of the kisses of a harlot . What , must you kneel ? Well , then , upon your forehead . She kisses him upon the forehead as he kneels . He slowly rises , and as he rises he takes on dignity . His fool 's cap is dropped aside , he picks up the dead sailor 's sword and girds it on him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>Ah , it is true . There is magic in it . You are handsome , too . I am not sorry to have kissed you . The old woman comes in .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>Well , what is the news ? The ship has sailed , has it not ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE OLD WOMAN</speaker>
      <p>Straight into the sunset .<stage>She sees the dead man , and looks at the Queen and at the fool .</stage>Who killed him ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>I killed him . He was left behind , and I do not like to have strangers about .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE OLD WOMAN</speaker>
      <p>It is a good omen . I have not seen a dead man for twenty years , save those that died of sickness and old age . When shall we have the good old times when men killed each other with swords ? I feel that it is coming . When shall we fall upon the four kingdoms , and tear them to pieces ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>Ah , that is an idea . That would be something to do .</p>
     </sp>

      <p>Speak , or be gone .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>It is doubtless a present for me . The Prince has bethought himself to pay me for my kindness to him . Go , and give orders that any men who are in the boat are to be brought to me , with their hands tied behind them , that I may decide what punishment to inflict upon them . Let it be understood that we do not like strangers in this kingdom .</p>

      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>And now I must finish my quaint task . It pleases me to be kissing fools . I think it is becoming a habit of mine . Come to this garden bench , where he and I sat together , and I will kiss you upon the mouth , as I kissed him . Does it hurt you for me to say that ? Good .<stage>They sit down .</stage>You are the only one in the kingdom who understands me . Lift up your head .<stage>She kisses him .

      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>Ah , I forgot , it is a hero I am making out of you , and all a hero can do is fight . That is a stupid thing . I am sorry now that I kissed you .</p>

You were better as a fool . The Prince enters , with his hands tied behind him , conducted by some soldiers .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Indignantly</stage>Why am I treated in this fashion ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>So it is you ? She looks at him quietly .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p><stage>haughtily</stage>Order that these bonds be taken from my wrists .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>We do not like strangers in this country . You were tied by my command , and brought here that I might decide what punishment to mete out to you . Look , this was one of your men .<stage>Pointing to the dead body</stage>Carry it away . The soldiers carry off the body .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>Are you mad ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>So it would seem .<stage>To the fool</stage>Now cut his bonds .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>He is a brave man , and does not deserve to be treated in this manner .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>Who are you that you should plead for me ? Have I not seen you with a fool 's cap ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>And now you see me with a sword . He cuts the Prince 's bonds .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>Leave us . I wish to speak with the Queen .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>to the fool</stage>No , stay .<stage>To the Prince</stage>It is not necessary for you to speak . You wish to tell me that the kisses you had from me were so sweet that you would like to buy some more , and are willing to put off your journey for a while .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>I have given up my journey for ever . I know that the only thing that is real in all the world is love . You are scornful . But I have neither pride nor shame . I kneel at your feet , and beg you to forgive me for my folly . He kneels .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>It is a pretty speech . But you are too late . I have forgotten you . While they were tying your hands , I was kissing this man upon the mouth .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p><stage>springing up</stage>It is a lie !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>Did you say that the Queen lies ? He draws his sword .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>I do not fight with fools .<stage>To the Queen</stage>Send him away , and have him beaten .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>Are you not willing to fight with him for me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>What do you mean ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>I mean that I have a new appetite , the appetite for death . I have held myself too lightly , I have gone too willingly to the arms of a chance lover . Now there must be blood to sweeten the kisses .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>Do you wish this fellow killed ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>Or you . It makes no difference — not the least . What are my kisses , that I should be careful to whom they go ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>You speak strangely , and I hardly know you . I have come back as a lover and not as a butcher .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>My whim has changed — I am in the mood for butchers , now .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>Say but one word to show that you still love me !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>I have no word to say .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p>Doubt makes my sword heavy . . . .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>And have you nothing to say to me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>You remind me . Come . I must finish what I have begun . She kisses him on the mouth — the third kiss .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCE</speaker>
      <p><stage>covering his eyes</stage>It is I that am mad .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>Come , if you are not afraid . They go out , the Prince giving one long look at the Queen , whose face remains hard . It has become a dark twilight .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>They told me that love was like this — but I laughed , and did not believe . The old woman comes in .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>I have sent him out to die .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE OLD WOMAN</speaker>
      <p>The fool ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>No , no , no , my lover , my beloved . I tortured him and denied him , and sent him out to die .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE OLD WOMAN</speaker>
      <p>It is well enough . Death is among us again , and the old times have come back . There are sounds of fighting , and the women wait in silence . Then the sounds cease , and slowly the soldiers bear in a dead body , which they lay on the steps . They affix torches to either side of the palace door , and go out .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p><stage>going up to the Queen , and holding out his sword to her , hilt-foremost</stage>I have done your bidding , and slain a brave man . Bid some one take this sword and slay me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE OLD WOMAN</speaker>
      <p>What a faint heart you are ! The fool 's cap is on you still . Put back your sword in your scabbard . You will make a soldier yet .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>You are a brave man . Put back your sword in your scabbard , and may it destroy all my enemies from this day forth .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>What shall I do ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE QUEEN</speaker>
      <p>I have created you , and now I must give you work to do . You can only fight . Very well , then . Take my soldiers , and lead them to the kingdom that thrusts its chief city against our kingdom 's walls . There should be good fighting , and much spoil . When the soldiers have glutted themselves with wine and women , let the city be set on fire . I shall look every night for a light in the sky , and when it comes I shall know it is my bonfire . Perhaps it will light up my heart for a moment . When that is finished , I shall find you other bloody work . Go .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE FOOL</speaker>
      <p>I understand . You shall have your bonfire . Come , old woman , I want some of your advice .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE OLD WOMAN</speaker>
      <p>The good old days have come back . Ah , the smell of blood ! They go out . The queen looks over at the dead man lying on the steps between the torches , and gradually her face softens . She goes over slowly , and kneels by his side , gazing on him . She kisses his mouth , and then rises , goes slowly to the arbour , and sits down . She looks away , and her face becomes hard again . A sound of trumpets and shouting , the menacing prelude of war , is heard outside .</p>

      <head>A DOMESTIC CONVERSATION</head>
      <stage>To THEODORE DREISER</stage>
      <stage>“ Enigma ” was first presented at the Liberal Club , New York City , in 1915 .</stage>
      <stage>A man and woman are sitting at a table , talking in bitter tones .</stage>
     </stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>So that is what you think .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Yes . For us to live together any longer would be an obscene joke . Let 's end it while we still have some sanity and decency left .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Is that the best you can do in the way of sanity and decency — to talk like that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>You 'd like to cover it up with pretty words , would n't you ? Well , we 've had enough of that . I feel as though my face were covered with spider webs . I want to brush them off and get clean again .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>It 's not my fault you 've got weak nerves . Why do n't you try to behave like a gentleman , instead of a hysterical minor poet ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>A gentleman , Helen , would have strangled you years ago . It takes a man with crazy notions of freedom and generosity to be the fool that I 've been .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>I suppose you blame me for your ideas !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>I 'm past blaming anybody , even myself . Helen , do n't you realize that this has got to stop ? We are cutting each other to pieces with knives .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>You want me to go . . . .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Or I 'll go — it makes no difference . Only we 've got to separate , definitely and for ever .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>You really think there is no possibility — of our finding some way ?... We might be able — to find some way .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>We found some way , Helen — twice before . And this is what it comes to . . . . There are limits to my capacity for self-delusion . This is the end .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Yes . Only —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Only what ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>It — it seems . . . such a pity . . . .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Pity ! The pity is this — that we should sit here and haggle about our hatred . That 's all there 's left between us .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>standing up</stage>I wo n't haggle , Paul . If you think we should part , we shall this very night . But I do n't want to part this way , Paul . I know I 've hurt you . I want to be forgiven before I go .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>standing up to face her</stage>Ca n't we finish without another sentimental lie ? I 'm in no mood to act out a pretty scene with you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>That was unjust , Paul . You know I do n't mean that . What I want is to make you understand , so you wo n't hate me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>More explanations . I thought we had both got tired of them . I used to think it possible to heal a wound by words . But we ought to know better . They 're like acid in it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Please do n't , Paul — This is the last time we shall ever hurt each other . Wo n't you listen to me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Go on . He sits down wearily .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>I know you hate me . You have a right to . Not just because I was faithless — but because I was cruel . I do n't want to excuse myself — but I did n't know what I was doing . I did n't realize I was hurting you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>We 've gone over that a thousand times .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Yes . I 've said that before . And you 've answered me that that excuse might hold for the first time , but not for the second and the third . You 've convicted me of deliberate cruelty on that . And I 've never had anything to say . I could n't say anything , because the truth was ; too preposterous . It was n't any use telling it before . But now I want you to know the real reason .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>A new reason , eh ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Something I 've never confessed to you . Yes . It is true that I was cruel to you — deliberately . I did want to hurt you . And do you know why ? I wanted to shatter that Olympian serenity of yours . You were too strong , too self-confident . You had the air of a being that nothing could hurt . You were like a god .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>That was a long time ago . Was I ever Olympian ? I had forgotten it . You succeeded very well — you shattered it in me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>You are still Olympian . And I still hate you for it . I wish I could make you suffer now . But I have lost my power to do that .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Are n't you contented with what you have done ? It seems to me that I have suffered enough recently to satisfy even your ambitions .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>No — or you could n't talk like that . You sit there — making phrases . Oh , I have hurt you a little ; but you will recover . You always recovered quickly . You are not human . If you were human , you would remember that we once were happy , and be a little sorry that all that is over . But you can n't be sorry . You have made up your mind , and can think of nothing but that .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>That 's an interesting — and novel — explanation .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>I wonder if I can n't make you understand . Paul — do you remember when we fell in love ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Something of that sort must have happened to us .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>No — it happened to me . It did n't happen to you . You made up your mind and walked in , with the air of a god on a holiday . It was I who fell — headlong , dizzy , blind . I did n't want to love you . It was a force too strong for me . It swept me into your arms . I prayed against it . I had to give myself to you , even though I knew you hardly cared . I had to — for my heart was no longer in my own breast . It was in your hands , to do what you liked with . You could have thrown it in the dust .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>This is all very romantic and exciting , but tell me — did I throw it in the dust ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>It pleased you not to . You put it in your pocket . But do n't you realize what it is to feel that another person has absolute power over you ? No , for you have never felt that way . You have never been utterly dependent on another person for happiness . I was utterly dependent on you . It humiliated me , angered me . I rebelled against it , but it was no use . You see , my dear , I was in love with you . And you were free , and your heart was your own , and nobody could hurt you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Very fine — only it was n't true , as you soon found out .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>When I found it out , I could hardly believe it . It was n't possible . Why , you had said a thousand times that you would not be jealous if I were in love with some one else , too . It was you who put the idea in my head . It seemed a part of your super-humanness .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>I did talk that way . But I was n't a superman . I was only a damned fool .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>And Paul , when I first realized that it might be hurting you — that you were human after all — I stopped . You know I stopped .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Yes — that time .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Ca n't you understand ? I stopped because I thought you were a person like myself , suffering like myself . It was n't easy to stop . It tore me to pieces . But I suffered rather than let you suffer . But when I saw you recover your serenity in a day while the love that I had struck down in my heart for your sake cried out in a death agony for months , I felt again that you were superior , inhuman — and I hated you for it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Did I deceive you so well as that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>And when the next time came , I wanted to see if it was real , this godlike serenity of yours . I wanted to tear off the mask . I wanted to see you suffer as I had suffered . And that is why I was cruel to you the second time .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>And the third time — what about that ? She bursts into tears , and sinks to the floor , with her head on the chair , sheltered by her arms . Then she looks up .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Oh , I can n't talk about that — I can n't . It 's too near .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>I beg your pardon . I do n't wish to show an unseemly curiosity about your private affairs .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>If you were human , you would know that there is a difference between one 's last love and all that have gone before . I can talk about the others — but this one still hurts .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>I see . Should we chance to meet next year , you will tell me about it then . The joys of new love will have healed the pains of the old .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>There will be no more joy or pain of love for me . You do not believe that . But that part of me which loves is dead . Do you think I have come through all this unhurt ? No . I cannot hope any more , I cannot believe . There is nothing left for me . All I have left is regret for the happiness that you and I have spoiled between us . . . . Oh , Paul , why did you ever teach me your Olympian philosophy ? Why did you make me think that we were gods and could do whatever we chose ? If we had realized that we were only weak human beings , we might have saved our happiness !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>shaken</stage>We tried to reckon with facts — I cannot blame myself for that . The facts of human nature : people do have love affairs within love affairs . I was not faithful to you . . . .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>rising to her feet</stage>But you had the decency to be dishonest about it . You did not tell me the truth , in spite of all your theories . I might never have found out . You knew better than to shake my belief in our love . But I trusted your philosophy , and flaunted my lovers before you . I never realized —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Be careful , my dear . You are contradicting yourself !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>I know I am . I do n't care . I no longer know what the truth is . I only know that I am filled with remorse for what has happened . Why did it happen ? Why did we let it happen ? Why did n't you stop me ? . . . I want it back !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>But , Helen !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Yes — our old happiness .... Do n't you remember , Paul , how beautiful everything was —?<stage>She covers her face with her hands , and then looks up again .</stage>Give it back to me , Paul !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>

      <p>I know we can be happy again . It was all ours , and we must have it once more , just as it was .<stage>She holds out her hands .</stage>Paul ! Paul !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>desperately</stage>Let me think !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>scornfully</stage>Oh , your thinking ! I know ! Think , then — think of all the times I 've been cruel to you . Think of my wantonness — my wickedness — not of my poor , tormented attempts at happiness . My lovers , yes ! Think hard , and save yourself from any more discomfort . . . . But no — you 're in no danger . . . .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>What do you mean ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>laughing hysterically</stage>You have n't believed what I 've been saying all this while , have you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Almost .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Then do n't . I 've been lying .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Again ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Again , yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>I suspected it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>mockingly</stage>Wise man !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>You do n't love me , then ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Why should I ? Do you want me to ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>I make no demands upon you . You know that .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>You can get along without me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>coldly</stage>Why not ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Good . Then I 'll tell you the truth !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>That would be interesting !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>I was afraid you did want me ! And — I was sorry for you , Paul — I thought if you did , I would try to make things up to you , by starting over again — if you wanted to .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>So that was it . . . .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Yes , that was it . And so —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>harshly</stage>You need n't say any more . Will you go , or shall I ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>lightly</stage>I 'm going , Paul . But I think — since we may not meet this time next year — that I 'd better tell you the secret of that third time . When you asked me a while ago , I cried , and said I could n't talk about it . But I can now .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>You mean —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Yes . My last cruelty . I had a special reason for being cruel to you . Sha n't I tell you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Just as you please .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>My reason was this : I had learned what it is to love — and I knew that I had never loved you — never . I wanted to hurt you so much that you would leave me . I wanted to hurt you in such a way as to keep you from ever coming near me again . I was afraid that if you did forgive me and take me in your arms , you would feel me shudder , and see the terror and loathing in my eyes . I wanted — for even then I cared for you a little — to spare you that .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>speaking with difficulty</stage>Are you going ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p><stage>lifting from the table a desk calendar , and tearing a leaf from it , which she holds in front of him . Her voice is tender with an inexplicable regret .</stage>Did you notice the date ? It is the eighth of June . Do you remember what day that is ? We used to celebrate it once a year . It is the day —<stage>the leaf flutters to the table in front of him</stage>— the day of our first kiss . . . . He sits looking at her . For a moment it seems clear to him that they still love each other , and that a single word from him , a mere gesture , the holding out of his arms to her , will reunite them . And then he doubts . . . . She is watching him ; she turns at last toward the door , hesitates , and then walks slowly out . When she has gone he takes up the torn leaf from the calendar , and holds it in his hands , looking at it with the air of a man confronted by an unsolvable enigma .</p>

      <p>You mean — Mrs. Lovberg ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Yes — but . . . I 'm not mistaken , am I ? Mrs. Lovberg is — or was — Hedda Gabler . Is n't that true ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>Oh , yes , it 's Hedda . But she prefers to be called by her husband 's name . Did you wish to see her ? She is busy just now .</p>

      <speaker>THE STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Busy ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>Yes — she is conducting her class in Modern Adolescence .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>How like Hedda ! Always experimenting with something or other ! What is she teaching them ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>She 's teaching them what she calls “ sex-unconsciousness . ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Dear me ! What is sex-unconsciousness ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>I 'm sure I do n't know , sir .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Dear , delightful Hedda ! Ever in pursuit of the new sensation !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>You are an old friend of hers , I suppose ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Well , no , not exactly . The fact is —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>You 're not a reporter , are you ? Hedda does n't talk to reporters — any more .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>No . I 'm not a reporter .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>What are you , then ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE STRANGER</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>I am the representative of the International Ibsen</l>
       <l>Society . You know who Ibsen was , of course ?</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>Yes — he was that nasty man who wrote plays about everybody 's private affairs .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>There is that point of view , of course . I 'm sorry to intrude —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>I should think you would be ! Now that she and Lovberg are happily married —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>That 's precisely it . You see , we 've just discovered that instead of committing suicide , as Ibsen made them do in the play , they eloped and were eventually married . You can n't imagine how delighted we all are to discover that Hedda is still alive . As soon as we found that out , I was sent here immediately —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>What did you think you would see ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>See ? I shall see a woman whose soul burns with an unquenchable flame of divine adventurousness . I shall see the most ardent , impatient , eager , restless , impetuous , and insatiably romantic woman in the world .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p><stage>pointing to the door</stage>You mean — her ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Yes — why , there is the very sofa upon which she and Lovberg used to sit , in the old days , discussing his past . There he would sit and tell her of his escapades , his affairs , everything . Tell me , does she insist on Lovberg 's being polygamous , whether he wants to or not ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>Evidently you do n't know the new Hedda . Or the new Lovberg either . The only thing they talk about is what they call “ the monogamist ideal . ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>There is some mistake . I will find out when I see her . Surely she is still interested in adventure — the free life — vine - leaves — beauty —! I will remind her of her own past —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>No you wo n't . She wo n't let you . She will tell you that too much attention is paid to such foolishness nowadays .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>She ! who was interested in nothing else ! But then — what is she interested in , now ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>In “ co-operation . ” THE STRANGER , Has she then turned into a mere sociologist ? Oh , you are deceiving me !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>If you do n't believe me — I 'll just open the door an inch , and you can hear her talking .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Oh , it cannot be true ! The maid quietly opens the door a little way . He listens .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>A VOICE</speaker>
      <p><stage>heard through the aperture</stage>We must all learn to function socially . . . . The maid shuts the door again .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>Do you believe it now ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>sadly</stage>It is too true !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>Did n't I tell you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>So Hedda has become — a reformer !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>And Lovberg — what does he do ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>He is rewriting his book — you know , the one Hedda burned up — for use as a text-book in the public schools . And Hedda is helping him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>No more adventure — no more beauty — the flame . . . gone out ! My God ! He staggers toward the wall , where a pistol is hanging , and puts his hand on it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>Look out ! That 's Hedda 's pistol . You never can tell when an old piece of junk like that is loaded .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Yes — I know .<stage>He takes it down and aims it at his heart .</stage>The old Hedda is gone . I cannot bear the new . It would be too —<stage>The maid screams</stage>— too dull . He fires , and falls .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p><stage>going over and looking down at him</stage>But — people do n't do such things !</p>

     <stage type="setting">
      <stage>The living room of a summer cottage in Camelot , Maine . A pretty woman of between twenty-five and thirty-five is sitting in a big chair in the lamplight darning socks . She is Mrs. Arthur B. Robinson — or , to give her her own name , Guenevere . She is dressed in a light summer frock , and with her feet elevated on a settle there is revealed a glimpse of slender silk-clad ankles . It is a pleasant summer evening , and , one might wonder why so attractive a woman should be sitting at home darning her husband 's socks , there being so many other interesting things to do in this world . The girl standing in the doorway , smiling amusedly , seems to wonder at it too . The girl 's name is Vivien Smith .</stage>

     </sp>

      <p>I 'm afraid I have got something else on , Gwen — I 'll give you one guess .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>You can n't pretend to be art-ing at this hour of the night .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>VIVIEN</speaker>
      <p>I could pretend , but I wo n't . No , Gwen dear , it 's not the pursuit of art , it 's the pursuit of a man .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Do n't try to talk like a woman in a Shaw play . I do n't like this rigmarole about “ pursuit . ” Say you 're in love , like a civilized human being . And take a cigarette , and tell me about it .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p><stage>mildly</stage>Oh , be a savage all you want to , Gwen . But do n't tell me you 're going in for this modern free-love stuff , because I wo n't believe it . You 're not that kind of fool , Vivien .<stage>She darns placidly away .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>VIVIEN</speaker>
      <p>No , I 'm not . I 'm not a fool at all , Gwen dear . I know exactly what I want — and it does n't include being disowned by my family and having my picture in the morning papers . Free-love ? Not at all . I want to be married .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Well , for heaven 's sake , who is it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>VIVIEN</speaker>
      <p>Is it possible that it 's not being gossiped about ? You really have n't heard ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Not a syllable .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>VIVIEN</speaker>
      <p>Then I sha n't tell you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>But — why ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>VIVIEN</speaker>
      <p>Because you 'll think I 've a nerve to want him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Nonsense . I do n't know any male person in these parts who is good enough for you , Vivien .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>VIVIEN</speaker>
      <p>Thanks , darling . That 's just what I think in my calmer moments . But mostly I 'm so crazy about him that I 'm almost humble . Can you imagine it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Well , what 's the matter , then ? Does n't he reciprocate ? You do n't look like the victim of a hopeless passion .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>VIVIEN</speaker>
      <p>Oh , he 's in love with me all right . But he does n't want to be . He says being in love interferes with his work .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>What nonsense !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>VIVIEN</speaker>
      <p>Oh , I do n't know about that ! I think being in love with me would interfere with a man 's work . I should hope so !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p><stage>primly</stage>I do n't interfere with Arthur 's work .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>VIVIEN</speaker>
      <p>Arthur 's a professor of philosophy . Besides , Arthur had written a book and settled down before he fell in love with you . I 'm dealing with a man who has his work still to do . He thinks if he had about three years of peace and quiet and hard work , he 'd put something big across . He put it up to me as a fellow-artist . I know just how he feels . I suppose I am very distracting !</p>

      <p>Well , why do n't you give him his three years ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>VIVIEN</speaker>
      <p>Gwen ! What do you think I am ? An altruist ? A benefactor of humanity ? Well , I 'm not , I 'm a woman . Three years ? I 've given him three hours , and threatened to marry a man back at home if he does n't make up his mind before then .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Heavens , Vivien , you are a savage ! Well , did it work ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>VIVIEN</speaker>
      <p>I do n't know . The three hours are n't up yet . I 'm going around to get my answer now . I must say the prospect is n't encouraging . He started to pack up to go to Boston . He says he wo n't be bullied .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>But Vivien !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>VIVIEN</speaker>
      <p>Oh , do n't condole with me yet , Gwen dear . It 's twelve hours before that morning train , and I 'm not through with him yet .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p><stage>curiously</stage>What are you going to do ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>VIVIEN</speaker>
      <p>Nothing crude , Gwen dear . Oh , there 's lots of things I can do . Cry , for instance . He 's never seen a woman cry . Maybe you think I can n't cry ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>It 's hard to imagine you crying .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>VIVIEN</speaker>
      <p>I never wanted anything badly enough to cry for it before . But I could cry my heart out for him . I 've absolutely no pride left . Well — I 'm going to have him , that 's all .<stage>She throws her cigarette into the grate , and starts to go .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>And what about his work ? Suppose it 's true —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>VIVIEN</speaker>
      <p>Suppose it is . Then his work will have to get along the best way it can .<stage>She turns at the door .</stage>Do I look like a loser ?— or a winner !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>I 'll bet on you , Vivien .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>VIVIEN</speaker>
      <p>Thanks , darling . And bye-bye .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p><stage>stopping her</stage>But Vivien —! I 've been racking my brain to think who —? Do tell me !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>VIVIEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>in the doorway , defiantly</stage>Well , if you must know — it 's Lancelot Jones .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p><stage>springing up , amazed , incredulous and horrified</stage>Oh , no , Vivien ! Not Lancelot !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>VIVIEN</speaker>
      <p>Absolutely yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>But — but he 's married already !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>VIVIEN</speaker>
      <p>Oh , is that what 's bothering you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>I should rather think it would bother you , Vivien !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>VIVIEN</speaker>
      <p>But it so happens that it does n't . I 'm not breaking up a marriage . There is n't any marriage there to break up . I know all about it . Lancelot told me . That marriage was ended long ago . It 's simply that he has never got a divorce .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>But — but if that 's true , why has n't he got a divorce ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>VIVIEN</speaker>
      <p>On purpose , Gwen — as a protection ! Against love-sick females like me . Against getting married again . I told you he wanted to work .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>But Vivien ! If he has n't got a divorce —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>VIVIEN</speaker>
      <p>He 'll have to get one , that 's all . It wo n't take long . And in the meantime we can be engaged .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>A funny sort of engagement , Vivien — to a married man !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>VIVIEN</speaker>
      <p>I think you 're very unkind , Gwen . It is n't funny at all . It 's a nuisance . We 'll have to wait at least a month ! I think you might sympathize with me . I believe you 're in love with him yourself .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p><stage>coldly</stage>Vivien !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>VIVIEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>contritely</stage>I 'm sorry . I did n't mean it . But I do think he 's so terribly nice — I do n't see how any woman can help being in love with him . Well — I 'm off to his studio , to learn my fate . Wish me luck , if you can ! She goes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p><stage>looks after her , then drifts over to the mantel , leans against it staring out into space , and then murmurs</stage>— Lancelot ! She goes slowly back to her chair , sits still a moment , and then quietly resumes the darning of socks .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Enter , from the side door , Mary , the pretty servant girl , who fusses about at the back of the room .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>No , ma'am . I do n't feel like going out tonight . Something in her tone makes Guenevere turn .</p>

      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p><stage>quietly</stage>What is it , Mary ?</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Yes . I think you 'd better tell me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>I wanted to tell you .<stage>She comes to Guenevere , and sinks beside her chair .</stage>I wanted to tell you before Mr. Robinson came back . I could n't tell you if he was here .</p>

      <p>That 's what it is , ma'am . He always makes me think of my father .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Is your father a just man , too , Mary ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>Yes , ma'am . He 's that just I 'd never dare breathe a word to him about what I 've done . He 'd put me out of the house .</p>

     <sp>

      <p>It 's Mr. Jones , ma'am .</p>

      <p>This is terrible ! When did it happen ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>It — it sort of happened last night , ma'am . It was this way —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>No details , please !</p>

       <l>No , ma'am . I just wanted to tell you how it was . You see , ma'am ,</l>

     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>Yes , ma'am .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>I do n't mean that I blame you . One can n't help — falling in love ....</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>No , you just can n't help it , can you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>But Lancelot — Mr. Jones — should have behaved better than that ....</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>Should he , ma'am ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>He certainly should . I would n't have believed it of him . So that is why — Mary ! Do you know —? But I 'm not sure that I ought to tell you . Still , I do n't see why I should protect him . Do you know that he is going away ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>No , ma'am . Is he ?</p>

      <p>Yes . In the mo'rning . You must go to see him tonight . No , you can n't do that .... Oh , this is terrible !</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>I 'm glad he 's going away , Mrs. Robinson .</p>

      <p>Why ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>Because I 'd be so ashamed every time I saw him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p><stage>looking at her with interest</stage>Really ? I did n't know people felt that way . Perhaps it 's the right way to feel . But I did n't suppose anybody did . So you want him to go ?</p>

      <p>Yes , ma'am .</p>

      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Well ! I really do n't know . But one is supposed to . Mary , you are a modern woman !</p>

      <p>Am I ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>One would think , after what happened —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>That 's just it , ma'am . If it had been anything else — But after what happened , I just want never to see him again . You see , ma'am , it was this way —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p><stage>gently</stage>Is it necessary to tell me that , Mary ? I know what happened .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>But you do n't , ma'am . That 's just it . I 've been trying to tell you what happened , ma'am .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Good heavens , was it so horrible ! Well , go on , then .<stage>She nerves herself to hear the worst .</stage>What did happen ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>Nothing , ma'am ....</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Nothing ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>That 's just it ....</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>But I — I do n't understand .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>You said a while ago , Mrs. Robinson , that you could n't help falling in love . It 's true . I tried every way to stop , but I could n't . So last night I — I went to his studio —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Yes ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>I told you I was a wicked girl , Mrs. Robinson . You know I 've a key to let myself in to clean up for him . So last night I just went in . He — he was asleep —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Yes ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>I — shall I tell you , ma'am ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Yes . You must tell me , now .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>And I —<stage>She sits kneeling , looking straight ahead , and continues speaking , in a dead voice</stage>I could n't help it . I put my arms around him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Yes ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>And he put his arms around me , Mrs. Robinson , and kissed me . And</l>
       <l>I did n't care about anything else , then . I was glad . And then —</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Yes ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>And then he woke up — and he was angry at me . He swore at me . And then he laughed , and kissed me again , and put me out of the room .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Yes , yes . And that — that was all ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>I came home . I thought I would have died . I knew I had been wicked . Oh , Mrs. Robinson —<stage>She breaks down and sobs .</stage></p>

      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>But it 's jest the same , Mrs. Robinson . I wanted to be wicked .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Never mind , Mary . We all want to be wicked at times . But something always happens . It 's all right . You 're a good girl , Mary . There , stop crying !... Of course , of course ! I might have known . Lancelot could n't — and yet , I wonder .... Mary , stand up and let me look at you !</p>

      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p><stage>in a strange tone</stage>You 're a very good-looking girl , Mary .... So he laughed , and gave you a kiss , and led you to the door !... Well ! Go to bed and think no more about it . It 's all right .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>Do you really think so , Mrs. Robinson ? Is n't it the same thing if you want to be wicked —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>You 're talking like a professor of philosophy now , Mary . And you 're a woman , and you ought to know better . No , it is n't the same thing , at all . Run along , child .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>Yes , ma'am . Thank you , ma'am . Good night , ma'am . She goes .</p>

      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Good-night , Mary .<stage>She returns to her darning . She smiles to herself , then becomes serious , stops work , and looks at the clock . Then she says</stage>— Vivien ! Vivien 's tears ! Poor Lancelot ! Oh , well !<stage>She shrugs her shoulders , and goes on working . Then suddenly she puts down her work , rises , and walks restlessly about the room .... There is a knock at the door . She turns and stares at the door . The knock is repeated . She is silent , motionless for a moment . Then she says , almost in a whisper</stage>— Come ! A young man enters .</p>

      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>Thought I 'd stop in to say good-bye .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>That 's very sweet of you .</p>

      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Not really ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>Going in the morning .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Why the haste ? The summer 's just begun . I hear you 've been doing some awfully good things . I was going over to see them .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>Thanks . Sorry to disappoint you . But I 've taken it into my head to leave .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>You 're not going tonight , anyway . Sit down and talk to me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>All right .<stage>He sits , constrainedly .</stage>What shall I talk about ?</p>

      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Your love-affairs , then .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>Do n't want to .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Then read to me . There 's some books on the table .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p><stage>opening a serious-looking magazine</stage>Here 's an article on “ The Concept of Happiness ” — by Professor Arthur B. Robinson . Shall I read that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>I gather that you are not as fond of my husband as I am ,</l>
       <l>Lancelot . But try to be nice to me , anyway . Read some poetry .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p><stage>takes a book from the table , and reads</stage>— “ It needs no maxims drawn from Socrates To tell me this is madness in my blood — ”</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He pauses . She looks up inquiringly . Presently he goes on reading — “ Nor does what wisdom I have learned from these Serve to abate my most unreasoned mood . What would I of you ? What gift could you bring , That to await you in the common street Sets all my secret ecstasy a-wing Into wild regions of sublime retreat ? And if you come , you will speak common words — ” He stops , and flings the book across the room . She looks up .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Do n't you like it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p><stage>gloomily</stage>Hell ! That 's too true .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Try something else .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>Do you enjoy seeing me suffer ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Does talking to me make you suffer ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>I 'm sorry .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>Then let me go .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>No . Sit there and talk to me , like a rational human being .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>I 'm not a rational human being . I 'm a fool . A crazy fool .</p>

      <p><stage>smiling at him</stage>I like crazy fools .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>Yes — again — and as soon as possible — to Vivien .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>I congratulate you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>I love her .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Naturally .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>She loves me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>I trust so .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>Then why should I be at this moment aching to kiss you ? Tell me that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p><stage>looking at him calmly</stage>It does seem strange .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>It is absolutely insane ! It 's preposterous ! It 's contradictory !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Are you quite sure it 's all true ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>Yes ! I 'm sure that I never would commit the rashness of matrimony again without being in love . Very much in love . And I 'm equally sure that I would not stand here and tell you what a fool I am about you , if that were n't true . Do you think I want to be this way ? It 's too ridiculous — I did n't want to tell you . I wanted to go . You made me stay . Well , now you know what a blithering lunatic I am .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p><stage>quietly</stage>It is lunacy , is n't it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>Is it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Sheer lunacy . In love with one woman , and wanting to kiss another . Disgraceful , in fact .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>I know what you think ! You think I 'm paying you an extremely caddish compliment — or else —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p><stage>earnestly , as she rises</stage>No , I do n't think that at all , Lancelot . I believe you when you say that about me . And I do n't imagine for one moment that you 're not really in love with Vivien . I know you are . I could pretend to myself that you were n't — just as you 've tried to pretend to yourself sometimes , that I 'm not really in love with Arthur . But you know I am — do n't you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>Yes . ...</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Well , Lancelot , there are — two lunatics here .<stage>He stares at her .</stage>It 's almost funny . I do n't know why I 'm telling you . But —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>You —!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Yes . I want to kiss you , too .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>But this wo n't do . As long as there was only one of us —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>There 's been two all along , Lancelot . I 've more self-control than you — that 's all . But I broke down tonight . I knew I ought n't to tell you — now . But I knew I would .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>You , too ! They have unconsciously circled about to the opposite side of the room .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Oh , well , Lance , I fancy we are n't the only ones . It 's a common human failing , no doubt . Lots of people must feel this way .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>What do they do about it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Well , it all depends on what kind of people they are . Some of them go ahead and kiss . Others think of the consequences .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>Well , let 's think of the consequences , then . What are they ? I forget .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>I do n't . I 'm keeping them very clearly in mind . In the first place —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>Yes ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>What was it ? Yes — in the first place , we would be sorry . And in the second place —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>In the second place —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>In the second place — I forget what 's in the second place . But in the third place we must n't . Is n't that enough ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>Yes . I know we must n't . But — I feel that we are going to .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Please do n't say that .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>But is n't it true ? Do n't you feel that , too ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>Then we 're lost .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>No . We must think !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>I can n't think .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Try .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>It 's no use . I can n't even remember “ in the first place , ” now .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Then — before we do remember —! He takes her in his arms . They kiss each other — a long , long kiss .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>Sweetheart !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p><stage>holding him at arm 's length</stage>That was in the second place , Lancelot . If we kiss each other , we 'll begin saying things like that — and perhaps believing them .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>What did I say ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Something very foolish .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>What , darling ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>There , you did it again . Stop , or I shall be doing it , too . I want to , you know .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>Want what ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>To call you darling , and believe I 'm in love with you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>Are n't you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>I must n't be .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>But are n't you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Oh , I —<stage>She closes her eyes , and he draws her to him . Suddenly she frees herself .</stage>No ! Lancelot — no ! I 'm not in love with you . And you 're not in love with me . We 're just two wicked people who want to kiss each other .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>Wicked ? I do n't feel wicked . Do you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>No . I just feel natural . But it 's the same thing .<stage>He approaches her with outstretched arms . She retreats behind the chair .</stage>No , no . Remember that I 'm married .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>I do n't care .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Then remember that you 're engaged !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>Engaged ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Yes : to Vivien .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p><stage>stopping short</stage>So I am .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>And you 're in love with her .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>That 's true .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>You see now that you can n't kiss me , do n't you ? LANCELOT<stage>dazedly</stage>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Then thank heavens ! for I was about to let you . And that 's in the fifth place , Lancelot : if we kiss each other once , we 're sure to do it again and again — and again . Now go over there and sit down , and we 'll talk sanely and sensibly .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p><stage>obeying</stage>Heavens , what a moment ! I 'm not over it yet .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Neither am I . We 're a pair of sillies , are n't we ? I never thought I should ever behave in such a fashion .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>It was my fault . I should n't have started it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>I am as much to blame as you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>I 'm sorry .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Are you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>I ought to be . But I 'm not , exactly .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>I 'm not either , I 'm ashamed to say .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>The truth is , I want to kiss you again .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>And I ... But do you call this talking sensibly ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>I suppose it is n't . Well , go ahead with your sixth place , then . Only , for heaven 's sake try and say something that will really do some good !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Very well , Lancelot . Do you really want to elope with me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>Very much .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>That 's not the right answer . You know perfectly well you want to do nothing of the sort . What ! Scandalize everybody , and ruin my reputation , and break Vivien 's heart ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>No — I do n't suppose I really want to do any of those things .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Then do you want us to conduct a secret and vulgar intrigue ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p><stage>hurt</stage>Guenevere !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>You realize , of course , that this madness of ours might last no longer than a month ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p><stage>soberly</stage>Perhaps .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Well , do you still want to kiss me ?— Think what you are saying , Lancelot , for I may let you . And that kiss may be the beginning of the catastrophe .<stage>She moves toward him .</stage>Do you want a kiss that brings with it grief and fear and danger and heartbreak ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>No —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Then what do you want ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>I want — a kiss .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Never . If you had believed , for one your chance .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>Kiss me !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Never . If you had believed , for one moment , that it was worth the price of grief and heartbreak , I should have believed it too , and kissed you , and not cared what happened . I should have risked the love of my husband and the happiness of your sweetheart without a qualm . And who knows ? It might have been worth it . An hour from now I shall be sure it was n't ; I shall be sure it was all blind , wicked folly . But now I am a little sorry . I wanted to gamble with fate . I wanted us to stake our two lives recklessly upon a kiss — and see what happened . And you could n't . It was n't a moment of beauty and terror to you . You did n't want to challenge fate . You just wanted to kiss me .... Go !</p>

      <p>What do you mean ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p><stage>brutally</stage>You ! You want a love-affair . Your common sense tells you it 's folly . Your reason wo n't allow it . So you want your common sense to be overwhelmed , your reason lost . You want to be swept off your , feet . You want to be made to do something you do n't approve of . You want to be wicked , and you want it to be some one else 's fault . Tell me — is n't it true ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Yes , it is true — except for one thing , Lancelot . It 's true that I wanted you to sweep me off my feet , to make me forget everything ; it was wrong , it was foolish of me to want it , but I did . Only if you had done it , you would n't have been “ to blame . ” I should have loved you for ever because you could do it . And now , because you could n't I despise you . Now you know . ... Go .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>No , Guenevere , you do n't despise me . You 're angry with me and angry with yourself because you could n't quite forget King Arthur . You are blaming me and I am blaming you , is n't it amusing ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>You are right , Lancelot . It 's my fault . Oh , I envy women who can dare to make fools of themselves who forget everything and do n't care what they do ! I suppose that 's love — and I 'm not up to it .</p>

      <p>You are different ....</p>

      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Different ? Yes , I 'm a coward . I 'm not primitive enough . Despise me . You 've a right to . And — please go .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LANCELOT</speaker>
      <p>I 'm afraid I 'm not very primitive either , Gwen . I —</p>

      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>I 'm afraid you 're not , Lance . That 's the trouble with us . We 're civilized . Hopelessly civilized . We had a spark of the old barbaric flame — but it went out . We put it out — quenched it with conversation . No , Lancelot , we 've talked our hour away . It 's time for you to pack up . Good-bye .<stage>He kisses her hand lingeringly .</stage>You may kiss my lips if you like . There 's not the slightest danger . We were unnecessarily alarmed about ourselves . We could n't misbehave ! ... Going ?</p>

      <p>Damn you ! Good-bye ! He goes .</p>

      <speaker>GUENEVERE</speaker>
      <p>Well , that did it . If he had stayed a moment longer —! She flings up her arms in a wild gesture — then recovers herself , and goes to her chair , where she sits down and quietly resumes the darning of her husband 's socks .</p>

      <docTitle><titlePart>The Maid ......... Jo Gotsch The Gypsy ........ Floyd Dell The King .......... Edward Goodman The Princess ...... Marjorie Jones Morning . A room in a palace , opening on a balcony . Through the arched broad window at the back is seen the sky , just beginning to be suffused with the rosy streakings of dawn . A large , wide heavy seat stands on a dais , with a low square stool beside it . A girl kneels on the stool , with her head and arms on the chair , dozing . The dark figure of a man appears on the balcony . He puts a leg over the window-ledge and climbs in slowly . A little noise wakes the girl . She stirs , looks round , jumps up , and starts to scream . THE MAN . Oh , not so loud ! THE GIRL . ( finishes the scream in a subdued voice . ) THE MAN . That 's better ! But you ought to be more careful . You might wake somebody up . THE GIRL . Who are you ? THE MAN . That 's just what I was about to ask you — tell me , are you a Princess , or a maidservant ? THE GIRL . A Princess ?— did you really think I might be a Princess ? THE MAN . Well , there are pretty Princesses . But I had rather you were a maidservant . THE GIRL . Would you ? Well , so I am ! THE MAN . Thank you , my dear . And what would you like me to be ? THE MAID . I 'm afraid you 're somebody not quite proper ! THE MAN . Right , my dear . You are a person of marvellous discernment . I am , in fact — THE MAID . The king of the Gypsies ! THE GYPSY . How did you know ? THE GIRL . I guessed it ! THE GYPSY . H 'm . You knew , I suppose , that our band has just encamped outside the city ? THE MAID . Yes . THE GYPSY . And you have heard of the exploits of the Gypsy king . You know that there is no wall high enough to keep him out , no force of soldiers strong enough — THE MAID . I know it by your eyes . They have the gypsy look in them . THE GYPSY . Where have you ever seen gypsies before ? THE MAID . Never mind . But tell me — the wall around the palace is seventeen feet high — THE GYPSY . True enough ! THE MAID . A guard of soldiers continually marches around it — THE GYPSY . Very true ! THE MAID . And there are spikes on the top . How did you get over ? THE GYPSY . That is my secret . Would I be the gypsy king if everybody knew what I know ? THE MAID . Wo n't you tell me ? THE GYPSY . Women have asked me that many times . But I never tell . But , though I wo n't tell you how I entered , I do n't mind telling you why . THE MAID . Oh , I know that already ! THE GYPSY . You think , perhaps , that I am a thief as well as a housebreaker — that it is in the hope of royal treasure left unguarded that I have come here . ... THE MAID . You have come here because you took a fancy to see what was on the other side of the wall . Is n't that it ? THE GYPSY . At last I have found some one in this stupid city who understands me . Young woman — THE MAID . Yes ? THE GYPSY . You do not belong here . There is no one here who does things because they are foolish and interesting . Would you like to come away with me ? THE MAID . Oh , no . You must not think , because I understand you , that I approve of you . You see — THE GYPSY . You do n't approve of me ? THE MAID . No — but I like you . I can n't help it . I always did like Gypsies . You see , I was brought up among them . THE GYPSY . You a Gypsy child ! THE MAID . I suppose I was . Though I always preferred to imagine that I was some Princess that had been changed in the cradle and stolen away . When I was hardly more than a baby , I remember that I disapproved of their rough ways . I can still faintly remember the jolting of the wagons that kept me awake , and the smell of the soup in the big kettle over the fire . THE GYPSY . It is a good smell . THE MAID . But I did not think so ! It smelled of garlic . And when I was six years old , I ran away . The tribe had encamped just outside the city here , and I wandered away from the tents , and entered the city-gate , and hid myself , and at night I came straight to the palace . The soldiers found me , and took me to the old king . He said that I should be the child of the palace . So they gave me white bread with butter on it , and put me to sleep between smooth white sheets . THE GYPSY . Gypsy children cannot thrive when they are taken into cities . They turn away from white bread with butter on it , and remembering the good smell of the soup in the big kettle over the fire , they fall sick with hunger . As for you — THE MAID . I thrived on the white bread with butter on it . THE GYPSY . You were a little renegade . But I forgive you ! And now to my business , I have come to see the King , and talk with him . We kings should become better acquainted , do n't you think ? I will ask him what he considers the proper price for telling fortunes , and find out what his ideas are on the subject of horse-trading . And no doubt he will ask me what I think about his coming marriage with the Princess of Basque . She is to arrive to-night , I believe , and be married tomorrow , to this King whom she has never seen ! THE MAID . Be careful , or you will awaken him . That is his bed-chamber , there . THE GYPSY . Ah ! Is he a light sleeper ? THE MAID . The King sleeps soundly , and awakens punctually every morning at six . THE GYPSY . ( with a glance at the sky ) It is not quite six . Every morning , you say ? And what then ? THE MAID . He goes for a walk at seven , and breakfasts at eight . Every morning . THE GYPSY . Regularly ? THE MAID . The King is always on time to the moment . THE GYPSY . Ah , one of those clockwork kings ! THE MAID . You must not make fun of him . He is a good king . THE GYPSY . I have no doubt of it . And his regularity will be a great comfort to his queen . She will always know that she will get her kiss regularly , punctually , on the stroke of the clock . But — you say the King rises at six , and goes for a walk at seven . What does he do in the meantime ? THE MAID . First he comes here and has his morning drink . Then he is dressed for his walk . THE GYPSY . And what is your part in these solemn proceedings ? THE MAID . I tie his slippers for him , and pour his drink . THE GYPSY . It is a great honour ! So great an honour that you come here before the sun is up to be ready for your duties . Do you entertain the King with conversation while he takes his morning drink ? THE MAID . No — the Gazetteer does that . THE GYPSY . The Gazetteer — what is the Gazetteer ? THE MAID . The Gazetteer is a man whose duty it is to find out all that happens in the city each day , and recite it to the King the next morning . THE GYPSY . Has the King as much curiosity as that ? I would never have thought it . THE MAID . It is n't curiosity . It 's just a custom that has sprung up . All the merchants and well-to-do people hire a Gazetteer . It may be useful to them — but I think the King regards it more as a duty than a pleasure . THE GYPSY . I remember now . They have something like it in the taverns . I foresee a great future for it .... THE MAID . And it seems to go with that new drink . THE GYPSY . What new drink ? THE MAID . Why , the new drink from Arabia . It has a queer name . Ka-Fe . THE GYPSY . Ka-Fe — and what is it like ? THE MAID . It is dark , and served hot with sugar and cream . THE GYPSY . It sounds interesting . I would like to taste it . What is it most like — mead , perhaps , or wine , or that strong liquor distilled from juniper berries ? THE MAID . Like none of these . It does not make men talk and sing and tell their secrets and reveal their love and their hate , and knock their heads against the stars and tangle their feet one with the other .... THE GYPSY . Then what is the good of it ? THE MAID . It makes the head clearer , and sobers the judgment . It makes men think more and talk less . And it gives them strength to rule their inward feelings . THE GYPSY . What a pity ! People are too much like that as it is . THE MAID . The King says that some time the whole world will learn to drink it ! THE GYPSY . A world of Ka-Fe drinkers ! A world where people rule their inward feelings and hide their secret thoughts ! I shall be dead before then , thank heaven ! THE MAID . But you keep your secrets — even from women — so you say . THE GYPSY . It was a vain boast . Sometime , with my head in a woman 's lap , I shall blab away the secrets that give me power . I know it . Somewhere in the world is a woman whose look will intoxicate me more than wine . And for her sake I shall invent some new folly . THE MAID . What a pity ! THE GYPSY . No — the thought cheers me . So long as there are women , men will be fools . Their Ka-Fe will not help them . THE MAID . Do you approve of folly , then ? THE GYPSY . It is the thing that makes life worth living . I have committed every kind of folly I know , and the world would be dull and empty if I did not think that some new and greater folly lay ahead . THE MAID . You think , then , that one should surrender oneself to folly ? THE GYPSY . I think so truly . What have you on the tip of your tongue ? What folly have you given yourself to , my child ? THE MAID . I am afraid you will laugh at me . ... THE GYPSY . Not I . Tell me , my dear , are you in love ? THE MAID . Yes .... THE GYPSY . With some one who will never give you love in return ? THE MAID . Yes . ... THE GYPSY . And is it —? THE MAID . The King — yes . Oh , I am a fool to tell you ! She hides her face in her hands . THE GYPSY . Listen , my child . You are not more a fool than I . The other day I rode out on a swift horse to be by myself under the sky , and think my thoughts . And there , a two days ’ journey from this city , I saw the slow-moving caravan of the Princess of Basque , on her way to wed this King whom she has never seen . Curiosity drew me near , for I wanted to see the face of the Princess . I tied my horse to a tree , and hid among the bushes by the road-side as they passed . I saw her among the cushions of the royal wagon . She had a strange , wild beauty . I saw her , and loved her , and grew sick with loneliness . I rode back to the city , and tried to wash out the memory of that face with wine . But it was no use , so I left the tavern and climbed the wall and entered the palace , that I might look also at the man whom she is to wed . When I have seen him , then I shall — I do n't know what . But — we are two foolish ones , you and I ! THE MAID . Thank you for telling me that . But you must go now . It is almost time for the King to come . THE GYPSY . What if he found me here — what would he do ? Have me beheaded , or merely thrown into prison ? THE MAID . No — he is a kind king . He would only tell you how wrong it is to break into people 's houses and show disrespect for the law . THE GYPSY . I had almost rather be put in prison than lectured at . Well , I must invent something to explain my presence . ( There is a knock . ) Who is that ? THE MAID . Hide yourself . I will see . THE GYSPY . ( from behind the curtains of the window ) I am hidden . The maid goes to the door , and comes back with a paper in her hand . THE GYPSY . Well ? THE MAID . ( looking at the paper ) The Gazetteer is ill , and cannot come . THE GYPSY . ( emerging from the curtains ) The Gazetteer is ill .... THE MAID . The King will be annoyed . THE GYPSY . We will spare his majesty that annoyance . I shall be the King 's Gazetteer this morning ! THE MAID . But how can you ? THE GYPSY . Leave that to me . ( He takes his position behind the curtains . ) Such news as he has never heard , I shall recite to the King ! THE MAID . Ssh ! Here he comes now ! The King enters , in his dressing gown , yawning , with his hand over his mouth . In the midst of his yawn , he speaks . THE KING . Goo ’ mo'ing ! THE MAID . ( bowing ) Good morning , your majesty ! THE KING . ( glancing out at the morning sky ) Looks like a nice day today . ( He sits down . ) THE GYPSY . ( from slightly behind the King 's seat ) Not a cloud in your majesty 's sky ! THE KING . ( twisting about to look at him ) And who the devil are you ? THE GYPSY . ( coming around in front and bowing ) I am the Gazetteer . THE KING . ( sputtering ) What are you trying to palm off on me ? You are not my Gazetteer ! My Gazetteer is decently dressed in black and white . You come here in red and yellow . What does it mean ? THE MAID . Your majesty , your own Gazetteer is ill and cannot come , so he has sent his cousin , who is in the same business . THE KING . ( disgustedly ) Bring me my Ka-Fe . ( The maid goes out . ) Now tell me , sirrah , you do n't mean to say that you are used by respectable people as a source of information ? I cannot believe it ! THE GYPSY . Your majesty , it would ill become me to deprecate the character of my clientele . They may not be rich , they may not be influential , but they are the foundation of your kingdom 's prosperity . And I must say for myself that for the one person that your Gazetteer serves , I serve many . You may sneer at my quality if you like , but I point to my circulation . I am the official Gazetteer of the Red-Horse Tavern , and scores of petty tradesmen , as well as clerks , bricklayers and truck drivers , depend upon me for their knowledge of the world 's events . THE KING . Well , well ! So you are in your humble way an agency of civilization ! THE GYPSY . Your majesty may well say so ! The maid has returned with the Ka-Fe . She puts the tray on the floor beside the seat , and kneels by it . The King 's cup she places on the stool at his hand . THE KING . ( sipping his Ka-Fe ) Very well . Proceed . THE GYPSY . ( reciting ) This is the story of a crime ! The shop of the widow Solomon stands in the middle of the great street which takes its name from our King — may he live long and prosper ! In that shop are displayed for sale diamonds , rubies , emeralds , pearls , and all manner of precious stones , set in rings and chains curiously wrought of silver and gold . And there yesterday came a band of robbers — not in the night , when all men are asleep , and even the watch-dog dozes beside the door — but in the glare of day , intent on wickedness . They entered the shop , and with the threat of death stopped up the mouths of the servitors . Then they filled a large sack with their precious booty , and escaped . They have not been apprehended . This is the sixth in the series of daring daylight robberies that has occurred within the month . The failure of the police to deal with this situation has provoked widespread comment on the incompetency of the King 's Chief of Police , and there are some who assert that the police are in league with the robbers . The magnificent new house which the Chief of Police has been erecting , ostensibly with the money left him by a rich aunt of whom nobody ever heard , seems to lend colour to these — THE KING . What ! What ! What 's this ? Why , I never heard such impudence ! Fellow , do you mean to tell me — He becomes speechless , and sets down his Ka-Fe . THE GYPSY . Your majesty , I have especially softened the wording of this piece of news in order not to offend your majesty 's ears . But in substance that is the story which was told last night at every tavern in the city . THE KING . But , sirrah , I cannot permit — I simply cannot permit — why — why —! THE GYPSY . Suppose , your majesty , we skip the police news , and go on to gentler themes . THE KING . That would be better — much better . THE GYPSY . Shall we take up — politics ? THE KING . ( wearily ) Oh , yes . THE GYPSY . ( reciting ) A debate between the rival factions who seek to influence the governing of our kingdom through the so-called Council of Peers was held last night outdoors in the public market . The rival orators exceeded one another in dullness and hoarseness . The attendance was very slight . The general public takes little interest in these proceedings , knowing as it does that they are merely a diversion for the scions of old families whose energies are unemployed except in time of war . It is the general feeling , moreover , that the King may be depended upon to govern the kingdom properly without the interference of these aristocratic meddlers . THE KING . Ah , splendid , splendid ! Let us hear that again ! THE GYPSY . A debate between the rival factions — THE KING . No , no — the last part . That about meddling . THE GYPSY . It is the general feeling , moreover , that the King may be depended upon to govern the kingdom properly — THE KING . Without interference from these aristocratic meddlers . Yes , yes ! Those are my sentiments exactly . How well put that is — without interference ! Ah , it shows that I am appreciated among the lower classes . They understand me . What did you say they were ? Petty tradesmen and clerks and bricklayers ? THE GYPSY . And truck drivers , your majesty . THE KING . And truck drivers . Splendid fellows , all of them . As you said — the backbone of my king-dom . I must appoint a royal commission to investigate the welfare of the truck drivers . The Council of Peers will object — but I shall ignore them . Broken-down aristocrats ! what do they know about governing a kingdom ? They are useful only in war-time . Fighting is their only talent . In times of peace they are a nuisance . I shall not let them come between me and my people . ... ( He rises , and with a dignified oratorical gesture addresses an imaginary audience ) — Tradesmen ! Clerks ! Truck drivers ! The time has come — ( He pauses , frowns , and sits down again . ) Never mind that now . Go on with the news . THE GYSPY . The rest of the political news is uninteresting , your majesty . THE KING . It usually is . This is the first time it has ever been otherwise . Turn to something else . THE GYPSY . I will turn to the society items , your majesty . THE KING . Good . THE GYPSY . ( reciting ) All tongues are discussing the approaching nuptials of the King and the Princess of — THE KING . Tut ! tut ! I fear this is not a proper topic for — THE GYPSY . It is a matter of interest to all your subjects , your majesty . THE KING . Well , well — go on . A public figure like myself must submit to having his private affairs discussed . It is unfortunate , but — go on . THE GYPSY . ( reciting ) — the approaching nuptials of the King and the Princess of Basque . The details of the royal bride 's trousseau are already well known to the public , down to the last garter . The six embroidered chemises from Astrakhan — The maid shows great interest . The King is embarrassed . THE KING . But , my dear fellow — really , you know —! This is —! THE GYPSY . Items of this nature , your majesty , are recited in the bazaar to audiences composed exclusively of women . Under the circumstances there is surely no impropriety — THE KING . Very well . I accept your explanation . But as your present audience is not composed exclusively of women , I suggest that you omit those details .</titlePart></docTitle>
     </titlePage>
     <performance>THE GYPSY . Your majesty , I omit them . The account continues .... ( Reciting ) The marriage has excellent reasons of state for being made , inasmuch as it cements in friendship two kingdoms which have been at war with each other off and on for a hundred years . But it has its romantic side as well . It is , in fact , a love-match . The fact that the royal lovers have never seen each other only emphasizes its romantic quality . Their joy in beholding in actuality what they have for three long months cherished so dearly in imagination , is a theme for the poet laureate — who will , however , we fear , judging from his past performances , hardly do it justice . It is , as we have said , a love - match . The royal pair fell in love with what they had heard of each other — the Princess of Basque with the image she had formed in her mind from glowing reports of the King 's valour , amounting to rashness , his fluency of poetic speech , his manly bearing , and his irrepressible wit .... ( The King nods gravely at each item . ) While the King became madly enamoured of the reputation of the Princess of Basque for sweetness , industry in good works , and the docility which befits a wife , even of a King .... ( The King nods gravely at these items also . ) She is , indeed , a pattern of all the domestic virtues — she is quiet , obedient , dignified — There is a cry in a high feminine voice , outside . All look toward the window . A girl appears , running past , with short loose hair tossing about her face . She pauses , and flings herself over the window-ledge , and is standing — panting , red-cheeked , smiling — in the room . The King rises . THE KING . ( furious , yet coldly polite ) And who , in the name of the sacred traditions of womanhood , are you ? THE FIGURE . I — I am the Princess of Basque ! They stare at her .</performance>

      <p>You ? What are you doing here ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>Your majesty , the palace is in a turmoil . The attendants are helping the soldiers keep order among the crowd in the courtyard — the gentlemen-in-waiting are receiving deputations with wedding presents — the women are distributing medals bearing the image of the bride . All the city is celebrating her unexpected arrival , and rejoicing with you in your presumed happiness . In this disturbed state of affairs , I have been drafted into your majesty 's service , and come to bring you a message .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p><stage>bitterly</stage>I hoped I would never see you again . It all began with you . If I were a superstitious person I would say you brought misfortune with you into this house . Before you came this morning , everything was as it had always been — orderly and regular . What is your message ? That madwoman has not escaped , has she ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>The young woman who calls herself the Princess of Basque is safe under lock and key , according to your majesty 's orders .</p>

      <p>Is she well guarded ?</p>

      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>The soldier who conducted her from the room this morning is keeping guard at the door , your majesty . I recognized him by the black eye she gave him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>Good . What is your news ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>Your majesty , I am bidden to tell you that the Royal Archivist , whom you bade to search through the histories of your royal ancestors for some precedent to guide you in this matter , has locked himself with his forty assistants in the royal library , and cannot be roused by knocking .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>They have fallen asleep among the archives .... What else ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>Your majesty , the Royal Physician has been summoned , according to your orders , to examine the young woman as to her sanity . But she refuses to answer all questions , asserting that she is in a state of abounding health , and is in no need of the services of a physician .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>How can we prove her mad if she will not answer questions !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>Further , I am bidden to tell you that the watchman on the tower has seen two horsemen in the far distance galloping toward the city . They come by the eastern road , and it is believed that they are couriers from the King of Basque .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>This matter must be settled before they arrive . Is there anything else ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>Yes , your majesty . The Eldest of the Wise Men has come here in answer to your summons .</p>

      <p>This would never have happened to my ancestors . Not to Otho , nor Magnus , nor Carolus , nor Gavaine . Am I less than these ? Perhaps I am , but the same blood flows in my veins , and while it flows I shall rule as they ruled . The Gypsy ushers in the Eldest of the Wise Men .</p>

      <p>Your majesty —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>I have sent for you , O Eldest of the Wise Men , in an hour of extreme perplexity . Not lightly would I have torn you from your meditations . I have need of your wisdom .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE WISE MAN</speaker>
      <p>Whatever your majesty wishes to know , I shall answer out of the fulness of knowledge born of long study and deep reflection . Speak , O King ! Is it of Infinity that you would ask ? or of Eternity ?— or of the Absolute ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>Nothing so simple . I want to know what to do with a madwoman who climbed in at my window an hour since , asserting herself to be the daughter of the King of Basque , and my affianced bride — and with a misguided populace which insists upon celebrating my alleged happiness .<stage>The tumult is heard outside , this time with a harsh note in it . The King starts , turning to the Gypsy .</stage>Is that a sound of rejoicing ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>No , your majesty . That sound means that the rumour has just spread among them that the Princess of Basque has been falsely imprisoned in the palace . They are calling for blood .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>What ! An uprising against me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>Not at all , your majesty . They hold your majesty blameless .</l>
       <l>They believe that you have been deceived by the false counsel of the</l>
       <l>Eldest of the Wise Men . It is his blood they are calling for .</l>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p><stage>to the Eldest of the Wise Men</stage>There you have it ! That , as some one has admirably phrased it , is the situation in a nutshell . What shall we do ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p><stage>stupefied</stage>But your majesty —!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>Your advice — what is it ? Come , be quick . Out of your wisdom , born of long study and deep reflection , speak the word that shall set this jangled chaos in order once more .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE WISE MAN</speaker>
      <p>Your majesty , I am afraid I do not understand these things . If you had asked me about the Absolute —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>There is no Absolute any more ! The Absolute has been missing from this kingdom — and for all I know , from the Universe — since half - past six o'clock this morning . No one regrets its absence more than I . There can be no comfort , no peace , no order , without an Absolute . But we must face the facts . The Absolute is gone , and this kingdom will be without one until I restore it with my own hands . I shall set about doing so immediately . And meanwhile , old man , you had better seek some safe corner where my misguided populace cannot lay hands on you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE WISE MAN</speaker>
      <p>Your majesty —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>Go . We have business to attend to .<stage>The Eldest of the Wise Men goes out .</stage>And now , you sharp-nosed scoundrel , I want some of your advice ! When the roof of the world has fallen in , there are no precedents , wisdom is worthless , and the opinion of one man is as good as that of another ,— if not better . So what have you to suggest ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>Your majesty , before I make my suggestion , let me confess to you that I had underrated the force of your majesty 's personality . Not until this moment have I understood that you possess the qualities of kingship as well as the title of king .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>Well , what of that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>This , your majesty . There is only one man in your kingdom who can cope with this girl whom you call mad . Your servants cannot do it . As I passed by the room where she is imprisoned , I heard the soldier whose eye she blacked talking to her . He was saying that it was a great honour to have had a black eye from her hands , and he was begging her autograph . If she had desired to escape , she could have done so — he is her devoted slave . And the doctor who went to examine her as to her sanity has stayed to talk to her about horse-breaking . That , as you know , is his avocation ; and he has found in her a woman who knows more about it than he does . He sits there like a man entranced . They are all putty in her hands .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p><stage>impatiently</stage>Get to the point .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>I have said that there is only one man in the kingdom who can cope with her . And that man is your majesty 's self . THE KING . I ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>Yes — you must go to her yourself .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>There 's an idea . But what am I to do then ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>Talk to her , make her your friend . Coax her secret out of her , and you will find that she is some madcap actress from a travelling company of mountebanks , who has done this thing in order to have the story told by the gazetteers and bring people to look at her . Get her to confess , and then let her story spread among the crowd — and the whole uprising that is now taxing the resources of the palace guard will dissolve in a burst of laughter .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>I will do it . If it is not a kingly duty , I shall at least accomplish it in a kingly manner . Thank you , my friend . But what is this ?</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>Two couriers from the King of Basque have arrived on foam - flecked horses , and ask to see you instantly .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>Let them wait . I have other affairs in hand . Send them here on the stroke of noon .<stage>To the Gypsy</stage>Your explanation may be the correct one . But my own opinion is that she is mad . Whatever it is , I shall soon have the truth .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>May the fortune of kings attend you ! The King goes out . The Gypsy and the maid seat themselves idly on the edge of the dais .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>Poor woman ! No doubt she went mad with love of the King , until she imagined herself to be his bride . I can understand that ! Poor woman !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>I am almost sorry for him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>Sorry for him ? You mean , for her !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>The Princess of Basque needs none to be sorry for her . She can take care of herself — as she proved on the eye of the soldier who locked her up .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>Then you believe it ? That she is the Princess of Basque ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>I know it . Have I not seen her face ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>Then why did you not speak up ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>Who am I , to interfere in the prenuptial courtesies of a royal pair ? Besides , it will give her an insight into the character of her future husband .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>You are very unjust to the King , to say that . He is not unkind . He only had her locked up because he thought her demented .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>Precisely . Oh , she is not one to mind a little rough handling . She gives as good as she gets . She will not hold that against him . But that he should think her mad because she came unattended , at an unexpected hour , with flushed cheeks and laughing lips to meet her lover —!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>Because she came climbing in at the window like a madwoman !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>You think as the King does . For you there are no ways but the way to which you are accustomed . That is sanity to you , and all else is madness . You have a map of life which is like your maps of the world — with all the safe known places marked by their familiar names , and outside you have drawn childish pictures of fabulous beasts , and written , “ This is a desert . ” But I tell you I have gone into these deserts , and found good green grass there , and sweet spring water , and delightful fruits . And beyond them I have seen great mountains and stormy seas .... And I shall go back some day , and cross those mountains and those seas , and find what lies beyond .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>Yes , it must be interesting to travel .</p>

      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>In your majesty 's presence ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>I will sit down too . We will sit here together . It is unconventional , but — there is no one to see . Please ! He takes her by the hand and conducts her up the dais to the wide seat . He seats himself beside her .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>It is very kind of your majesty to give so much of your time to a troublesome girl .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>I confess that I find it a pleasure to converse with you . It is a relief from the burden of my royal responsibilities .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>I did not know that a king had responsibilities . I thought he stood above such things .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>My responsibilities are many and grave .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>Yes . What are they ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>It would take too long to enumerate them in detail . Suffice it to say that the happiness of a whole people depends on me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>The happiness of a whole people .... That means : merchants — and clerks — and —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>And bricklayers . Yes , and truck drivers . They look to me for their happiness .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>In what does the happiness of a truck driver consist , O</l>
       <l>King ?</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>I am not sure . But I am going to appoint a royal commission to find out for me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>I can tell you now . The happiness of a truck driver consists in drinking beer with his friends at the tavern in the evening , and taking his sweetheart out to see the royal menagerie on Sunday afternoon . And do you know how you can best sub serve that happiness , O King ? By letting him alone , to drink his beer , and make love to his sweetheart .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>You are wrong . You must be wrong . If the happiness of a people were as simple as that , there would be no need of governments and kings to promote it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>Be thankful , O King , that they do not know that — and that they like to have kings and queens , to whom they give , in their generosity , palaces and horses and — and silken chemises from Astrakhan ! Why not enjoy the gifts we have , as the truck driver enjoys his beer and his sweetheart ? Let us each have our brief flash of happiness in the sun , O King !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>Your philosophy is the deadly enemy of mine .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>And must we be enemies of each other , too ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>Never , madam . Let us be friends in spite of our opinions .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>Your majesty is very gracious .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>And now that we are friends , I hope you will not keep up the jest any longer . The lady who is to be my wife and queen arrives in a few hours . You can see how necessary it is that the matter be cleared up before she comes . You will not continue to embarrass me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>Now that we are friends , I will tell you the truth . I am not she who is to be your wife and queen .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>Thank you . And in return , I forgive you freely for all the disturbances you have caused to me and my kingdom .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>I am sorry .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>Of course , you did not understand what you were doing . You did not realize how necessary to a kingdom is the tranquillity which comes only from perfect order and regularity . There has not been such a day as this before in the history of my kingdom . And there will never be such a day again . Tomorrow all will be smooth and regular again .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>Smooth and regular ! Do you mean that you like things always to be the same , with never any change ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>I happen to like it , yes . But it is not a question of what one likes . It is a question of what is necessary . Even if I did not like order , I would have to submit myself to its routine . That is what it means to be a king .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>And is that what it means to be a queen ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>In this kingdom , yes . In other places , there may be some relaxation of the traditional rule which compels a queen to be in every way a pattern to her subjects . But the queen of my kingdom will always be a model of perfect womanhood .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>And what if she did not wish to be ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>She would learn that her wishes were unimportant .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>And if she refused to learn that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p><stage>grimly</stage>I would teach her .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p><stage>with flashing eyes</stage>You mean you would make her obey ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>That is a hard saying . But this kingdom has not been built up with centuries of blood and toil to be torn down at the whim of a foolish girl . I have a duty to perform , and that is to hand on the kingdom to my descendants as it was handed on to me from my great ancestors , Otho and Magnus , Carolus and Gavaine . And by the blood that once flowed in their veins and now flows in mine , I will so do it — and rather than fail , I would break into pieces a woman 's body and a wife 's heart .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>I understand you fully . And may I go now ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>First you must tell me who you are and how you came to play this mad prank .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>Your majesty , I am only a foolish girl . I will not tell you my name , but I came from the kingdom of Basque .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>Have you ever seen the Princess , by any chance ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>I was in the royal caravan .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>Then you know the Princess !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>Not so well as I thought , your majesty . But I had heard so much talk of her coming marriage and of her great happiness , that there was nothing else in my mind . I dreamed of it day and night .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>Poor child .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>You may well say so . I dreamed of it until I lost all sense of reality , and imagined that I was that happy girl who was going to meet her lover .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>Madness !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>It was madness — nothing else . I thought I was to become free — to throw off the restraints that had chafed me for so long at home . I thought I was going to see everything I wished to see , and do everything I wished to do — to follow every impulse , no matter where it led me — to commit every pleasant folly I chose — and be happy .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>What queer notions !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>I had queerer notions than that . I thought I loved a man that I had never seen . I thought he loved me . I pitied myself and him because we were so long apart , and I burned to go to him . So , while the slow-moving caravan was yet far from its destination , I rose secretly in the night , while the others slept , and saddled the fastest horse in the train . I rode under the stars , with only one thought — his arms about me at the journey 's end , his lips on mine . So I came to the city . I scaled the walls , and entered the palace at dawn .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>But tell me — the wall around the palace is seventeen feet high —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>True enough .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>A guard of soldiers continually marches around it —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>Very true .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>And there are spikes on the top . How did you get over ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>That is my secret . The rest I have told you . And now let me go .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>Tell me one thing more —</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>Nothing more ! I must go ! I feel that if I stay any longer , something dreadful will happen !</p>

      <p>I feel like the maiden in the story who was told that if she stayed till the clock struck , she would be changed into the shape of an animal . Something tells me that if I stay here till the clock strikes , we shall both be transformed into beasts . Oh , let me go !</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FIRST COURIER</speaker>
      <p>We came to tell you that she was missing from the caravan .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SECOND COURIER</speaker>
      <p>We feared for her safety .</p>

      <p>Your fears were needless .</p>
     </sp>

      <p>They told us —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>Never mind what they told you . You have seen . And now leave us .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE COURIERS</speaker>
      <p>Yes , your majesty . They go , the Gypsy following .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>And now , with apologies for the misunderstanding and delay , let me welcome you to my palace and my arms — my princess and my queen !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>You will not hold me to it !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>We cannot escape it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>But I am no fit queen for you . You know what I am like . You do not want me for a wife !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>It is not the things one wants , but the things that are necessary ....</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>I will never marry you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>You shall marry me tomorrow .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>I cannot .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>The preparations are made for the wedding . Two kingdoms hang on the event .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>Let them hang !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>You , the daughter of my father 's ancient foe , are to unite two kingdoms in fraternal amity . Do you understand ? War and peace are in the balance .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>War ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>Or peace . It rests with you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>I begin to understand . How strange to think of myself as a peace-offering — a gift from one kingdom to another ! Is that what it means to be a Princess ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>That is what it means .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>I had rather be a Gypsy , and choose my lover as I wandered the roads !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>But you are a Princess , and your choosing is between peace and war . Do you choose war ? THE PRINCESS<stage>fiercely</stage>For myself , yes . I would gladly lead an army against you . I would destroy with the sword everything that your kingdom stands for . And you — I would kill with pleasure .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>You might kill me , but the things for which my kingdom stands you cannot kill . They are indestructible . They are older than the world , and will last longer .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p><stage>sadly</stage>Yes — there was order before the world began its tumult , and there will be quiet when the final night sets in . I am only a spark in the great darkness , a cry in the wide silence .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>Do you submit ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>I am not stronger than death . I submit . I would not have those truck drivers leaving their sweethearts to go to war on account of me .<stage>She goes up to the curtain , and touches it .</stage>How thin the prison-wall is ! And yet it shuts me away from the sunlight . THE KING<stage>gently</stage>I am a good king , and I shall be a good husband .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>It will be easy for you , perhaps . To me it will not come so easy to be a good wife .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>Put yourself in my hands , and I will teach you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>I will try .<stage>She kneels at his feet .</stage>O King , I will be obedient to you in all things . I will obey your commands , and be as you wish me to be — a good wife and a good queen .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>For the sake of the truck driver and his sweetheart .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>As you will .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>I ask one small wish — that you leave me now . I must think over my new condition and all that it means .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>I am happy to see you in so profitable a frame of mind . Let me remind you that the royal luncheon will be served promptly in half an hour .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>I shall be there — on time .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>Meanwhile I leave you to your thoughts . He goes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>How weak I am !<stage>She goes to the wide seat , and sits down , brooding . The Gypsy steals in , and crouches on the dais beside the wide seat .</stage>A good queen , and a good wife —?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p><stage>softly</stage>Impossible . THE PRINCESS<stage>startled</stage>Was it I said that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Night . The curtains are drawn aside . The walls and pillars are silhouetted against a moonlit sky .... The Gypsy is standing by the window , looking out .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>Ah , nameless and immortal goddess , whose home is in the moonbeams ! I speak to you and praise you for perhaps the last time . O august and whimsical goddess , I am about to die for your sake — I , the last of your worshippers ! When I have perished on your altar , the whole world will be sane . Your butterflies will no longer whirl on crimson wings within the minds of men ; only the maggots of reason will crawl and fester . You will look , and weep a foolish tear — for all this is not worth your grief — and take your flight to other constellations .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p><stage>who has just entered and stands listening</stage>The constellations ! Oh , do teach me astronomy !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>Astronomy ! Why do you want to be taught astronomy ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>Because I want to be able to tell fortunes from the stars .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>That is astrology , my dear — a much more useful science . Come , and I will give you a lesson . Do you see that dim planet swinging low on the horizon ? That is my star . Its name is Saturn . It is the star of mischief and rebellion . I was born under that star , and I shall always hate order as Saturn hated his great enemy Jupiter .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>One does not need to know the stars to tell that . But let me counsel you to caution .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>Ah , my dear , that was a wifely speech ! You will make a success of marriage .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>I shall never marry .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>It would be a pity not to make some good man happy . You are the ideal of every male being in this kingdom , including its ruler .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>Do you really think I am the sort of girl to make the King happy ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>I am sure of it . You are the very one . You have all the domestic virtues . You are quiet , dignified , obedient . If you have any thoughts or impulses which do not fit into the frame of wifely domesticity , you know how to suppress them .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>You are making fun of me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>I am speaking the truth . You would make the King a perfect wife . Ah , if only you were the Princess of Basque , and she a child of the gypsies !— Shall I read your fortune from the stars ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>Yes !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>What is your birthday ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>I do not know .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>It is strange for a child of the gypsies not to know that . But I can guess . You were born under the sign of Libra .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>How can you tell that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>You counselled me to caution . Only one born under the sign of the scales could have made that speech . You have the balanced temperament .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>Which is my star ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>You are sixteen years old . When you were born , the planet housed in the sign of Libra was Venus . And so you will love not too much , nor too little , but well . A fortunate planet ! There it is , high in the heavens . And see , it is in conjunction with Jupiter . Do you know what that means ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>No ! Tell me !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>It means that love and authority will presently come together in your life .... Oh , happy , happy child !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>But I do not understand .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>There are some things past understanding . Even I do not quite understand it yet . I must think it out .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>Then think quickly — and advise me . For I read my fortune otherwise . I see myself growing hollow-eyed with looking in eternal silence at the man I love — and worse than that , at the woman I hate — for I do hate her . I shall go mad with wanting to speak out my love and hate . Tell me what to do !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>I cannot advise to rashness . I can only say — speak out your love and hate .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MAID</speaker>
      <p>Do you mean — tell him ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>Yes . Tell him . And do not be afraid . There is no man so proud but he is moved to tenderness when a woman says she loves him . You go to an easy task , my dear , as I go to a hard one . For there is no woman so kind but her heart is stirred with a base triumph and an easy scorn when a man speaks out his love .... They go out . From the other side the King and the Princess come in .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>I have shown you your apartment . If there is anything wanting to your comfort , name it and it shall be provided .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>Nothing is wanting , not even a lock on the door . I shall be happy in my dreams at least .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>Your delicacy of mind does you credit . I am glad to find that you are not lacking in that supreme attribute of young womanhood — modesty .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>You mistake me . There shall be no lock on the door of my dreams . And I shall meet again in dreams the lover whom I know so well .</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p><stage>scandalized</stage>Princess !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>Do you put a ban on my dreams , too ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>I forbid you to discuss such subjects .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>Very well . I shall keep my thoughts to myself .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>Princess , I understand that it is your avocation to be a horse-breaker .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>It is one of them .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>It shall be one of mine to be a woman-breaker .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>It is well to know where we stand .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>You promised this morning to submit yourself to me , and learn to be a good wife .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>So I did . And perhaps so will I. I do not know .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>In what way do I displease you ? If it is anything which I can change without hurt to the well-being of my kingdom and the traditions of my ancestors , I will gladly change it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>There are many things — too many to enumerate in detail .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>Name one of them .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>For one thing , you seem a trifle less handsome than the portrait of you they gave me .— But I suppose you have been thinking the same thing about me . Indeed , my portrait must have flattered me greatly , since you did not recognize me this morning ....</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>For a moment — it must have been intuition — I did think it was you . Unfortunately , I allowed my judgment to lead me astray .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>It always will , if you pay any attention to it . So you did believe it was I for a moment ? That is interesting ! And how did you feel ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>I — shall I tell you ?</p>
     </sp>

      <p>Yes — tell me !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>I felt embarrassed that I should have been receiving you in my dressing gown .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p><stage>coming back to him</stage>Yes . It was quite right to tell me . And I can see now why you would feel that way . You wanted to look your best for me , did n't you ? I quite understand that . I spent weeks trying on my new gowns , and deciding in which one I would seem most beautiful to you . Only , of course , I forgot at the last moment , and rode off to you in this !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>I — I can understand how you felt . I am — sorry I disappointed you . Forgive me .</p>

      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>Yes .<stage>After a silence</stage>I suppose we can be happy together — after a fashion .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>I am sure of it . And now — shall we go down to the throne-room to rehearse the ceremony for tomorrow ?</p>
     </sp>

      <p>Please leave me here a while . I want to think .</p>

      <p>One moment ! There is a girl here I am sorry for . Can we not think of some way to help her before we go ? She loves the King . Think !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GYPSY</speaker>
      <p>I have thought . She is the rightful Princess of Basque — stolen from her cradle by Gypsies . Tomorrow an old woman from the tribe will come with the proofs . The King will marry her , and they will be happy .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PRINCESS</speaker>
      <p>Ah , there is a fire in our hearts that will shatter and destroy all comfort , even our own . Not even there , under the stars , among the winds , shall the hunger and thirst of love be quenched . Never shall our dream come true ....</p>

      <p>Over the rim of the world ! They ascend and vanish outside . POOR HAROLD ! A COMEDY To DUDLEY FIELD MALONE This play was first produced in Croton-on-Hudson , N. Y ., by the Mt . Airy Players , in 1920 , with the following cast : Harold ...................... Eugene Boissevain Isabel ...................... Doris Stevens Mrs. Murphy .................. B. Marie Gage Mrs. Falcington .............. Crystal Eastman A room in Washington Square South . By the light of a candle , a young man in tousled hair and dressing gown is writing furiously at a little table . A clock within strikes seven . A door at the back opens , and a young woman looks in , sleepily . She frowns . The young man looks up guiltily .</p>

     </sp>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Oh ! That 's all right . I thought perhaps you were writing to your father .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p><stage>bitterly</stage>My father ! Why should I write to my father ? Is n't it enough that I have broken his heart and brought disgrace upon him in his old age —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Disgrace ? Nonsense ! Anybody might be named as a co-respondent in a divorce case .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HE</speaker>
      <p>Not in Evanston , Illinois . Not when you are the local feature of a notorious Chicago scandal . Not when your letters to the lady are published in the newspapers .— Oh , those letters !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHE</speaker>
      <p>Were they such incriminating letters , Harold ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <p>Incriminating ? How can you ask that , Isabel ? They were perfectly innocent letters , such as any gentleman poet might write to any lady poetess . How was I to know that a rather plain-featured woman I sat next to at a Poetry Dinner in Chicago was conducting a dozen love-affairs ? How was I to know that my expressions of literary regard would look like love-letters to her long-suffering husband ? That 's the irony of it : I 'm perfectly blameless . God knows I could n't have been anything else , with her . But I 've always been blameless — in all the seven years of my marriage , I never even kissed another woman . And then to have this happen ! Scandal , disgrace , the talk of all Evanston ! Disowned by my father , repudiated by my wife , ostracized by my friends , cast forth into outer darkness , and dropped naked and penniless into Greenwich Village !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p><stage>laughing</stage>Oh , not exactly naked , Harold !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <p>One suit ! And that —<stage>he throws off his dressing gown</stage>evening clothes ! I might as well be naked — I can n't go anywhere in the daytime . I tell you I 'm not used to this . One week ago I had a house , a motor car , a wife , a position in my father 's law-office , a place in society —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>That 's just it — that 's why I was afraid you were writing to your father . He 'd send you money , of course . But if you ask him for it , I 'll never speak to you again . And as for clothes , you know there 's a suit of clothes in there ,— a perfectly good suit , too , and I think you 're an idiot not to put it on .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <p>Yes . One of Jim 's old suits .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>Well , what if it is ? It would fit you perfectly .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <p>Oh , Isabel ! Ca n't you see ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>No , I can n't see . If Jim is generous enough to give you a suit of clothes —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <p>Yes . That 's just it . Jim 's girl — Jim 's clothes —! Well —<stage>sullenly</stage>— I think Jim 's generosity has gone far enough . I 'll be damned if I 'll take his clothes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>You 're perfectly disgusting . If you were n't a silly poet and did n't know any better — Yes , Harold Falcington , for a nice boy as you are in most ways , you have the most antiquated and offensive ideas about women ! Jim knows better than to have ever considered me his property ....</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <p><stage>taken aback by her fierceness</stage>Good heavens , Isabel , I did n't mean that !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>Yes , you did , Harold ; but I 'm glad you 're sorry . It 's a good thing you were thrown out of Evanston , Illinois . It 's a good thing you came to Greenwich Village . And it 's a good thing that I 've a strong maternal instinct . If you 'll just get the idea out of your head that you 're a ruined man and a lost soul because you 've been talked about and have lost your job in your father 's office , and if you 'll just stop thinking that poor dear innocent Greenwich Village is a sink of iniquity and that I 'm a wicked woman —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <p>Isabel ! I never said you were a wicked woman ! I never thought such a thing !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>But you think you 're a wicked man ; and so it comes to the same thing . Look ! it 's broad daylight .<stage>She goes to the window , and opens the curtains .</stage>Put out that candle , and read me the letter you 've written to your wife . She comes back , blows out the candle herself , and sits down comfortably opposite him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <p>No , I can n't .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>Why not ? You 've read me all the others . Is this just like them ?<stage>Teasingly</stage>— “ Dear Gertrude : I know you will not believe me when I say that I have been the victim of a monstrous injustice , but nevertheless it is true . It has all been a hideous mistake . ” That 's the preamble . Then a regular lawyer 's brief , arguing the case — ten pages . Then a wild , passionate appeal for her to forget and forgive . I know how it goes . You 've written one every night . This is the seventh .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <p>This one is different .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>Good . What does it say ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <p>It says that I am in love with you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>Do n't prevaricate , Harold ! It says you are now hopelessly in the clutches of a vampire — does n't it ?</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>I knew it ! That 's what you would say . You 've told her it 's no use to forgive you now .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <p>Yes — I did say that — I do n't want her to forgive me , now . I am reconciled to my fate .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>Ah — but I 'm afraid it 's too late , now !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <p>What do you mean ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>I mean that your other letters will have done their work . Your wife by this time has been convinced of your innocence — she realizes that she has acted rashly — she is ready to forgive you . And she is probably at this moment on her way to New York to tell you so , and take you back home !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <p><stage>frightened</stage>No !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>Yes ! If she is not already here and looking for you ....</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <p>Impossible !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>Those letters were very convincing , Harold !</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>Then she has forgiven you anyway .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p><stage>sadly</stage>You do not know her .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>Do n't I ? No , Harold , this is to be our last breakfast together . You would n't have her walk in on us , would you ?— And that reminds me . We 're out of coffee . You must go and get some while I dress . And go to the little French bakery for some brioches .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <p>In these clothes ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>Or Jim 's . Just as you like .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <p>Very well . I shall go as I am .<stage>Gloomily</stage>After all , I do n't know why I should mind one more farcical touch to my situation . A grown man that does n't know how to earn his living —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>I 've suggested several ways .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <p>Yes , acting ! No . I 'd rather starve .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>There are other alternatives .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <p>Yes . Looking over the scientific magazines and finding out about new inventions , and writing little pieces about them and selling that to other magazines !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>Why not ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <p>A pretty job for a poet ! What do I know about machinery ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>All the poets I know pay their rent that way . And they none of them know anything about machinery .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <p>All right . I 'm in a crazy world . Everything 's topsy-turvy . Even the streets have gone insane . They wind and twist until they cross their own tracks . I know I 'll get lost looking for that French bakery .<stage>He goes to the door .</stage>Greenwich Village ! My God ! He goes out . She , after a moment , goes into the back room . The charwoman enters , and commences to clean up the place . Isabel comes back , partly clothed and with the rest of her things on her arm , and finishes her toilet in front of the mirror . A sort of conversation ensues .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE CHARWOMAN</speaker>
      <p>A grand day it 's going to be .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p><stage>after a pause</stage>— Do you think I 'm a bad woman , Mrs. Murphy ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. MURPHY</speaker>
      <p>Come , now , it 's not a fair question , and me workin ’ for you . I 've no call to be criticizin ’ the way you do behave . It 's my business to be cleanin ’ up the place , and if ‘ tis a nest of paganism , sure ‘ tis not for my own soul to answer for it at the Judgment Day . And a blessed thought it is , too , that they that follow after the lusts of the flesh must go to hell , or else who knows what a poor soul like me would do sometimes , what with seein ’ the carryin'shYpppHeNon that one does see . But I 'd not be breathin ’ a word against a nice young lady like yourself .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>What do you think of Mr. Falcington ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. MURPHY</speaker>
      <p>Well , as my sister that 's dead in Ireland used to say , and we two girls together , “ Sure , ” she said , “ there 's no accountin ’ for tastes , ” she said . And you with a fine grand man the like of Mr. Jim , to be takin ’ up with a lost sheep like this one . But I 'd not be sayin ’ a word against him , for it 's a pretty boy he is , to be sure . Well , there 's a Last Day comin ’ for us all , and the sooner the better , the way the young do be shiftin ’ and changin ’ as the fancy takes them . I say nothin ’ at all , nothin ’ at all — but if you 've a quarrel had with Mr. Jim , why do n't you make it up with him ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>But Jim and I are n't married either , you know .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. MURPHY</speaker>
      <p>It 's too soft you are , that 's why . You take no for an answer , as a girl should n't . Let you keep at him long enough , and he 'll give in . Sure the youth of this generation have no regard for their proper rights . Never was a man yet that could n't be come around , if he was taken in his weakness . A silk dress or a wedding ring or shoes for the baby , it 's all the same — they have to be coaxed twice for every one thing they do . It 's the nature of the beast , so it is , God help us . Well I remember how my sister that 's dead in Ireland used to say , and we girls together , “ Sure , ” says she , “ it 's woman 's place to ask , ” says she , “ and man 's to refuse , ” says she , “ and woman 's to ask again , ” says she . Widow that I am this ten year , I could tell you some things now — but I 'll not be sayin ’ a word .</p>

      <p>Do I look all right ?</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>MRS. MURPHY</speaker>
      <p>It 's pretty as a flower you look , Miss . And I 'd not be askin ’ questions , for it 's none of my business at all , but who are you fixin ’ yourself up for to-day , if you know yourself ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>What difference does it make ? I go into rehearsal next week , and there 's a manager that will want to make love to me , and he 's fat , and I 'll get to hate and loathe the sight of male mankind — and this is my last week to enjoy myself !<stage>She goes to the door at the back .</stage>Besides , Jim may have another girl by this time , or Mr. Falcington 's wife may come . She goes into the inner room .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. MURPHY</speaker>
      <p>His wife — God help us ! She shakes her head , and starts to go out . There is a knock . She opens the door , and admits a woman in a travelling suit .</p>

       <l>You look tired . Wo n't you have some coffee ? It 's ready .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p>Thank you . Yes . Both the women give an impression of timid courage .</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p><stage>pouring the coffee</stage>He ought to be back soon . He talked of getting lost in the crooked streets of the Village , and I 'm afraid that 's what has happened to him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p>Yes . Harold is all at sea in a strange place . She takes the coffee and sips it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>Tell me — how did you know ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p><stage>smiling</stage>Private detectives .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p><stage>a little shocked</stage>Oh !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p>Please do n't misunderstand me . I 'm not going to make any trouble .... But I did want to know what became of him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>Yes ... naturally .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p>And then — you see , I wanted to know what you were like ; and — and whether he was happy with you . I do n't think detectives are very intelligent . They could n't get it into their heads that I wanted the truth . They gave me a — a very lurid account of — of you . And of course Harold 's letters gave me no help . So I came down to see for myself .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p><stage>rising</stage>Mrs. Falcington : here is a letter that Harold was writing this morning . It tells about me — and I fancy you wo n't find it so essentially different from the detectives ’ account . Read it and see .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p><stage>reading the letter</stage>He says he loves you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>In those words ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p>No — he says he is involved in a strange and sudden infatuation . But it means the same thing .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>No it does n't . He is n't in love with me . I 'll tell you straight — he 's in love with you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p>How do you know ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>From the letters he wrote you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p>Oh ! he showed them to you , did he ? How like him !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>But he is in love with you . And he is n't happy with me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p>Why not ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>He hates this kind of life . He wants order , regularity , stability , comfort , ease , the respect of the community ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p>He used to tell me all those things bored him to death .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p><stage>pleading</stage>You must take him back !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p>Do n't you want him ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>Well —<stage>she laughs in embarrassment</stage>— Not that bad !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p>His father will make him an allowance to live on .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>I 've told him I would never speak to him again if he took it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p>You do n't expect him to work , do you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>Yes — if he has anything to do with me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p>Then if you can make him do that , by all means take charge of his destinies !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>But — but — that 's not the point . He loves you . He wants to go back . He did n't do any of those things he was accused of , you know .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p>Did he tell you that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p>Well — he told a story .<stage>Isabel is shocked .</stage>Oh , there 's no doubt about it .<stage>Her tone leaves none .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>But she was ugly !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p>Did he tell you that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>Yes ! Was n't she ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p>There are handsome poetesses — a few — and this was one of them . She is one of the most beautiful women in Chicago .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>Then he lied ....</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p>Oh , yes — of course . He just can n't help it . Any more than he can help making love ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>You mean this is not the first ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p>In the seven years of our marriage , he has made love to every pretty woman he came across .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p><stage>sharply</stage>Why did you stand for it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p>Because I was a fool . And because he is a child .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p><stage>almost pleadingly</stage>He can write poetry , can n't he ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p>Yes . Yes ! Oh , yes !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>Then — I suppose — it 's all right . But I 'm angry at myself , just the same , for being taken in .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p>It 's strange .... You feel humiliated at having been made a fool of for seven days . I 've been made a fool of for seven years , and I 've never realized that I had a right to feel ashamed .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>That 's the difference between Greenwich Village and Evanston ,</l>
       <l>Illinois .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p>Yes . But when I go back I shall lose the sense of it . I 'll think I 'm an injured woman because he was unfaithful to me , or because he brought scandal upon the family , or something like that . Now I realize that it 's none of those things . It 's — it 's just an offence against — my human dignity . I 've been treated like — like an inferior . But why should n't I be treated like an inferior ? I am an inferior . When I go back to Evanston , and take up grass-widowhood and the burden of living down the family scandal , and sit and twiddle my thumbs in a big house , and have my maiden aunt come to live with me ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>But why should you do that ? If that 's what it means to go back to Evanston , do n't go ! Stay here !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p>But — what could I do ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>Do ? Why — why — go on the stage !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p><stage>rising</stage>Are you in earnest ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>Look here . You 've a good voice , and you 're intelligent . That 's enough to start with . I do n't know whether you can act or not — but you 'll find out . And if you can n't act , you 'll do something else . Your people will stake you ?— give you an allowance , I mean ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p>To go on the stage with ? Never . But I 've a small income of my own . Only about a hundred a month . Would that do ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>Do ? Yes , that will do very well ! And now it 's my turn to ask you — are you in earnest ? Because I am .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p>You are the first human being who even suggested to me that I could do anything . I 've wanted to do something , but I could n't even think of it as possible . It was n't possible in Evanston . And as for acting , I kept that dream fast locked at the very bottom of my heart , for fear if I brought it out it would be shattered by polite laughter —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>You 'll have to expose that dream to worse things than polite laughter , my dear .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p>I can , now . It wo n't get hurt . I 'm free now to take care of my dream — to fight for it — to mike it come true . You have set me free .— I 'm going to go and get a room — now !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>Let me go with you and help you find one !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. FALCINGTON</speaker>
      <p>And to-morrow —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>To-morrow —</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Harold enters . He stops short in the doorway , and drops the brioches . He looks at one woman , then at the other . Suddenly he goes between them with arms outspread as though to keep the peace .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <p>No ! no ! I am not worthy of either of you !<stage>They stare at him , bewildered . He goes on</stage>— Why should you struggle over me ? Do not hate each other ! For my sake , be friends ! Ah , God , that this tragic meeting should have happened ! And now I must decide between you ....<stage>He goes to Mrs. Falcington and throws himself on his knees before her .</stage>Forgive and forget ! Come back with me to Evanston !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>FALCINGTON<stage>over his head to Isabel</stage>The perfect egotist ! The curtain falls , and then rises again for a moment . Harold is now on his knees to Isabel .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HAROLD</speaker>
      <p>Marry me !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ISABEL</speaker>
      <p>Harold ! You have not been all this time getting brioches . I smell — heliotrope ! The curtain rises and falls several times , showing Harold on his knees alternately to the two women , who look at each other above his head , paying no attention to him .</p>
