    <head type="act">ACT I</head>
    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>The hall of EARTH-SPIRIT , Act IV , feebly lighted by an oil lamp on the centre table . Even this is dimmed by a heavy shade . Lulu 's picture is gone from the easel , which still stands by the foot of the stairs . The fire-screen and the chair by the ottoman are gone too . Down left is a small tea-table , with a coffee-pot and a cup of black coffee on it , and an arm-chair next it .</stage>
     <stage>In this chair , deep in cushions , with a plaid shawl over her knees , sits Countess Geschwitz in a tight black dress . Rodrigo , clad as a servant , sits on the ottoman . At the rear , Alva Schoen is walking up and down before the entrance door .</stage>
    </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>He lets people wait for him as if he were a concert conductor !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>I beg of you , do n't speak !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>Hold my tongue , with a head as full of thoughts as mine is !— I absolutely can n't believe she 's changed so awfully much to her advantage there !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>She is more glorious to look at than I have ever seen her !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>God preserve me from founding my life-happiness on your taste and judgment ! If the sickness has hit her as it has you , I 'm smashed and thru ! You 're leaving the contagious ward like an acrobat-lady who 's had an accident after giving herself up to art . You can scarcely blow your nose any more . First you need a quarter-hour to sort your fingers , and then you have to be mighty careful not to break off the tip .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>What puts * us * under the ground gives * her * health and strength again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>That 's all right and fine enough . But I do n't think I 'll be travelling off with her this evening .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>You will let your bride journey all alone , after all ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>In the first place , the old fellow 's going with her to protect her in case anything serious —. My escort could only be suspicious . And secondly , I must wait here till my costumes are ready . I 'll get across the frontier soon enough alright ,— and I hope in the meantime she 'll put on a little embonpoint , too . Then we 'll get married , provided I can present her before a respectable public . I love the practical in a woman : what theories they make up for themselves are all the same to me . Are n't they to you too , doctor ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>I have n't heard what you were saying .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>I 'd never have got my person mixed up in this plot if she had n't kept tickling my bare pate , before her sentence . If only she does n't start doing too much as soon as she 's out of Germany ! I 'd like best to take her to London for six months , and let her fill up on plum-cakes . In London one expands just from the sea air . And then , too , in London one does n't feel with every swallow of beer as if the hand of fate were at one 's throat .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>I 've been asking myself for a week whether a person who 'd been sentenced to prison could still be made to go as the chief figure in a modern drama .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>If the man would only come , now !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>I 've still got to redeem my properties out of the pawn-shop here , too . Six hundred kilos of the best iron . The baggage-rate on ‘ em is always three times as much as my own ticket , so that the whole junket is n't worth a trowser 's button . When I went into the pawn-shop with ‘ em , dripping with sweat , they asked me if the things were genuine !— I 'd have really done better to have had the costumes made abroad . In Paris , for instance , they see at the first glance where one 's best points are , and bravely lay them bare . But you can n't learn that with bow-legs ; it 's got to be studied on classically shaped people . In this country they 're as scared of naked skin as they are abroad of dynamite bombs . A couple of years ago I was fined fifty marks at the Alhambra Theater , because people could see I had a few hairs on my chest , not enough to make a respectable tooth-brush ! But the Fine Arts Minister opined that the little school-girls might lose their joy in knitting stockings because of it ; and since then I have myself shaved once a month .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>If I did n't need every bit of my creative power now for the “ World-conqueror , ” I might like to test the problem and see what could be done with it . That 's the curse of our young literature : we 're so much too literary . We know only such questions and problems as come up among writers and cultured people . We cannot see beyond the limits of our own professional interests . In order to get back on the trail of a great and powerful art we must move as much as possible among men who 've never read a book in their lives , whom the simplest animal instincts direct in all they do . I 've tried already , with all my might , to work according to those principles — in my “ Earth-spirit . ” The woman who was my model for the chief figure in that , breathes to-day — and has for a year — behind barred windows ; and on that account for some incomprehensible reason the play was only brought to performance by the Society for Free Literature . As long as my father was alive , all the stages of Germany stood open to my creations . That has been vastly changed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>I 've had a pair of tights made of the tenderest blue-green . If * they * do n't make a success abroad , I 'll sell mouse-traps ! The trunks are so delicate I can n't sit on the edge of a table in ‘ em . The only thing that will disturb the good impression is my awful bald head , which I owe to my active participation in this great conspiracy . To lie in the hospital in perfect health for three months would make a fat pig of the most run-down old hobo . Since coming out I 've fed on nothing but Karlsbad pills . Day and night I have orchestra rehearsals in my intestines . I 'll be so washed out before I get across the frontier that I wo n't be able to lift a bottle-cork .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>How the attendants in the hospital got out of her way yesterday ! That was a refreshing sight . The garden was still as the grave : in the loveliest noon sunlight the convalescents did n't venture out of doors . Away back by the contagious ward she stepped out under the mulberry trees and swayed on her ankles on the gravel . The door-keeper had recognized me , and a young doctor who met me in the corridor shrunk up as tho a revolver shot had struck him . The Sisters vanished into the big rooms or stayed stuck against the walls . When I came back there was not a soul to be seen in the garden or at the gate . No better chance could have been found , if we had had the cursed passports . And now the fellow says he is n't going with her !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>I understand the poor hospital-brothers . One has a bad foot and another has a swollen cheek , and there appears in the midst of them the incarnate death-insurance-agentess ! In the Hall of the Knights , as the blessed division was called from which I organized my spying , when the news got around there that Sister Theophila had departed this life , not one of the fellows could be kept in bed . They scrambled up to the window-bars , if they had to drag their pains along with them by the hundred-weight . I never heard such swearing in my life !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>Allow me , Fraulein von Geschwitz , to come back to my proposition once more . Tho my father was shot in this room , still I can see in the murder , as in the punishment , nothing but a horrible misfortune that has befallen * her *; nor do I think that my father , if he had come through alive , would have withdrawn his support from her entirely . Whether your plan for freeing her will succeed still seems to me very doubtful , tho I would n't like to discourage you ; but I can find no words to express the admiration with which your self-sacrifice , your energy , your superhuman scorn of death , inspires me . I do n't believe any man ever risked so much for a woman , let alone for a friend . I am not aware , Fraulein von Geschwitz , how rich you are , but the expenses for what you have accomplished must have exhausted your fortune . May I venture to offer you a loan of 20 , 000 marks — which I should have no trouble raising for you in cash ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>How we did rejoice when Sister Theophila was really dead ! From that day on we were free from custody . We changed our beds as we liked . I had done my hair like hers , and copied every tone of her voice . When the professor came he called * her * “ gnaediges Fraulein ” and said to me , “ It 's better living here than in prison ! ” ... When the Sister suddenly was missing , we looked at each other in suspense : we had both been sick five days : now was the deciding moment . Next morning came the assistant .— “ How is Sister Theophila ? ” — “ Dead ! ” — We communicated behind his back , and when he had gone we sank in each other 's arms : “ God be thanked ! God be thanked ! ” — What pains it cost me to keep my darling from betraying how well she already was ! “ You have nine years of prison before you , ” I cried to her early and late . Now they probably wo n't let her stay in the contagious ward three days more !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>I lay in the hospital full three months to spy out the ground , after toilfully peddling together the qualities necessary for such a long stay . Now I act the valet here with you , Dr. Schoen , so that no strange servants may come into the house . Where is the bridegroom who 's ever done so much for his bride ? * My * fortune has also been destroyed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>When you succeed in developing her into a respectable artiste you will have put the world in debt to you . With the temperament and the beauty that she has to give out of the depths of her nature she can make the most blase public hold its breath . And then , too , she will be protected by * acting * passion from a second time becoming a criminal in reality .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>I 'll soon drive her kiddishness out of her !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>There he comes !<stage>Steps louden in the gallery . Then the curtains part at the head of the stairs and Schigolch in a long black coat with a white sun-shade in his right hand comes down . Thruout the play his speech is interrupted with frequent yawns .</stage></p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>Since nine o'clock this morning I 've been round to all the old-clothes-men . Three brand new trunks stuffed full of old trowsers I 've expressed to Buenos Ayres via Bremerhaven . My legs are dangling on me like the tongue of a bell . That 's the new life it 's going to be from now on !</p>
    </sp>

     <p>I can tell you a fine hotel . I lived there with a lady lion-tamer . The people were born in Berlin .</p>

     <p>Do you want me to start my new engagement in bath-robe and slippers ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>Hm — Sister Theophila would n't have gone to heaven so promptly either , if she had n't felt so affectionate towards our patient .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>She 'll have a different value when one must serve thru a honeymoon with her . Anyway , it can n't hurt her if she gets a little fresh air beforehand .</p>

     <p>What has that to do with you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>I get paid like a lamp-lighter , tho I had to demoralize all the Sisters in the hospital . Then came the assistants ’ and the doctors ’ turn , and then —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>Will you seriously inform me that the medical professors let themselves be influenced by you ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>But Fraulein von Geschwitz has reimbursed you for every penny that you spent . So far as I know you 're getting a monthly salary of five hundred marks from her besides . It is often pretty hard to believe in your love for the unhappy murderess . When I asked Fraulein von Geschwitz just now to accept my help , it certainly was not to incite your insatiable avarice . The admiration which I have learnt to have for Fraulein von Geschwitz in this affair , I am far from feeling towards you . It is not at all clear to me what claims of any kind you can make upon me . That you chanced to be present at the murder of my father has not yet created the slightest bond of relationship between you and me . On the contrary , I am firmly convinced that if the heroic undertaking of Countess Geschwitz had not come your way you would be lying somewhere to-day without a penny , drunken in the gutter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>And do you know what would have become of you if you had n't sold for two millions the tuppeny paper your father ran ? You 'd have hitched up with the stringiest sort of ballet-girl and been to-day a stable-boy in the Humpelmeier Circus . What work do you do ? You 've written a drama of horrors in which my bride 's calves are the two chief figures and which no high-class theater will produce . You walking pajamas ! You fresh rag-bag you ! Two years ago I balanced two saddled cavalry-horses on this chest . How that 'll go now , after this<stage>clasping his bald head</stage>, is a question sure enough . The foreign girls will get a fine idea of German art when they see the sweat come beading thru my tights at every fresh kilo-weight ! I shall make the whole auditorium stink with my exhalations !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>You 're weak as a dish-clout !</p>

     <p>What can I do for you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HUGENBERG</speaker>
     <p>I 've come from Muensterburg . I ran away this morning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>My eyes are bad . I am forced to keep the blinds closed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HUGENBERG</speaker>
     <p>I need your help . You will not refuse me . I 've got a plan ready . Can anyone hear us ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>What do you mean ? What sort of a plan ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HUGENBERG</speaker>
     <p>Are you alone ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>Yes . What do you want to impart to me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HUGENBERG</speaker>
     <p>I 've had two plans already that I let drop . What I shall tell you now has been worked out to the last possible chance . If I had money I should not confide it to you ; I thought about that a long time before coming .... Will you not permit me to set forth to you my design ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>Will you kindly tell me just what you are talking about ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HUGENBERG</speaker>
     <p>She cannot possibly be so indifferent to you that I must tell you that . The evidence * you * gave the coroner helped her more than everything the defending counsel said .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>I beg to decline the supposition .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HUGENBERG</speaker>
     <p>You would say that ; I understand that , of course . But all the same you were her best witness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>* You * were ! You said my father was about to force her to shoot herself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HUGENBERG</speaker>
     <p>He was , too . But they did n't believe me . I was n't put on my oath .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>Where have you come from now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HUGENBERG</speaker>
     <p>From a reform-school I broke out of this morning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>And what do you have in view ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HUGENBERG</speaker>
     <p>I 'm trying to get into the confidence of a turnkey .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>What do you mean to live on ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HUGENBERG</speaker>
     <p>I 'm living with a girl who 's had a child by my father .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>Who is your father ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HUGENBERG</speaker>
     <p>He 's a police captain . I know the prison without ever having been inside it ; and nobody in it will recognize me as I am now . But I do n't count on that at all . I know an iron ladder by which one can get from the first court to the roof and thru an opening there into the attic . There 's no way up to it from inside . But in all five wings boards and laths and great heaps of shavings are lying under the roofs , and I 'll drag them all together in the middle and set fire to them . My pockets are full of matches and all the things used to make fires .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>But then you 'll burn up there !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HUGENBERG</speaker>
     <p>Of course , if I 'm not rescued . But to get into the first court I must have the turnkey in my power , and for that I need money . Not that I mean to bribe him ; that would n't go . I must lend him money to send his three children to the country , and then at four o'clock in the morning when the prisoners of respected families are discharged , I 'll slip in the door . He 'll lock-up behind me and ask me what I 'm after , and I 'll ask him to let me out again in the evening . And before it gets light , I 'm up in the attic .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>How did you escape from the reform-school ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HUGENBERG</speaker>
     <p>Jumped out the window . I need two hundred marks for the rascal to send his family to the country .</p>

     <p>What do you want to do with your fire ? Do n't you know the lady 's been dead three weeks ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HUGENBERG</speaker>
     <p>Did they cut off her head ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>No , she 's got that still . She was mashed by the cholera .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HUGENBERG</speaker>
     <p>That is not true !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>What do you know about it ! There , read it : here !<stage>Taking out a paper and pointing to the place .</stage>“ The murderess of Dr. Schoen .... ”<stage>Gives Hugenberg the paper . He reads :</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HUGENBERG</speaker>
     <p>“ The murderess of Dr. Schoen has in some incomprehensible way fallen ill of the cholera in prison . ” It does n't say that she 's dead .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>Well , what else do you suppose she is ? She 's been lying in the churchyard three weeks . Back in the left-hand corner behind the rubbish-heap where the little crosses are with no names on them , there she lies under the first one . You 'll know the spot because the grass has n't grown on it . Hang a tin wreath there , and then get back to your nursery-school or I 'll denounce you to the police . I know the female that beguiles her leisure hours with you !</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>HUGENBERG</speaker>
     <p><stage>To Alva .</stage>Is it true that she 's dead ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>Thank God , yes !— Please , do not keep me here any longer . My doctor has forbidden me to receive visitors .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HUGENBERG</speaker>
     <p>My future is worth so little now ! I would gladly have given the last scrap of what life is worth to me for her happiness . Heigh-ho ! One way or another I 'll sure go to the devil now !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>If you dare in any way to approach me or the doctor here or my honorable friend Schigolch too near , I 'll inform on you for intended arson . You need three good years , to learn where not to stick your fingers in ! Now get out !</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>I 've had enough of this Geschwitz 's company ! If my bride is to become a corporation with limited liability , somebody else can go in ahead of me . I propose to make a magnificent trapeze-artist out of her , and willingly risk my life to do it . But then I 'll be master of the house , and will myself indicate what cavaliers she is to receive !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>The boy has what our age lacks : a hero-nature ; therefore , of course , he is going to ruin . Do you remember how before sentence was passed he jumped out of the witness-box and yelled at the justice : “ How do you know what would have become of you if you 'd had to run around the cafes barefoot every night when you were ten years old ?! ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>If I could only have given him one in the jaw for that right away ! Thank God , there are jails where scum like that gets some respect for the law pounded into them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>One like him might have been my model for my “ World-conqueror . ” For twenty years literature has presented nothing but demi-men : men who can beget no children and women who can bear none . That 's called “ The Modern Problem . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>I 've ordered a hippopotamus-whip two inches thick . If that has no success with her , you can fill my cranium with potato-soup . Be it love or be it whipping , female flesh never inquires . Only give it some amusement , and it stays firm and fresh . She is now in her twentieth year , has been married three times and has satisfied a gigantic horde of lovers , and her heart 's desires are at last pretty plain . But the man 's got to have the seven deadly sins on his forehead , or she honors him not . If he looks as if a dog-catcher had spat him out on the street , then , with such women-folks , he need n't be afraid of a prince ! I 'll rent a garage fifty feet high and break her in there ; and when she 's learnt the first diving-leap without breaking her neck I 'll pull on a black coat and not stir a finger the rest of my life . When she 's educated practically it does n't cost a woman half as much trouble to support her husband as the other way round , if only the man takes care of the mental labor for her , and does n't let the sense of the family go to wreck .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>I have learnt to rule humanity and drive it in harness before me like a well-broken four-in-hand ,— but that boy sticks in my head . Really , I can still take private lessons in the scorn of the world from that school-boy !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>She 'll just comfortably let her hide be papered with thousand-mark bills ! I 'll extract salaries out of the directors with a centrifugal pump . I know their kind . When they do n't need a man , let him shine their shoes for them ; but when they must have an artiste they cut her down from the very gallows with their own hands and with the most entangling compliments .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>In my situation there 's nothing more in the world to fear — but death . In the realm of sensation I am the poorest beggar . But I can no longer scrape up the moral courage to exchange my established position for the excitements of the wild , adventurous life !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>She had sent Papa Schigolch and me together in chase of some strong antidote for sleeplessness . We each got a twenty-mark piece for expenses . There we see the youngster sitting in the Night-light Cafe . He was sitting like a criminal on the prisoner 's bench . Schigolch sniffed at him from all sides , and remarked , “ He is still virgin . ”<stage>Up in the gallery , dragging steps are heard .</stage>There she is ! The future magnificent trapeze-artiste of the present age !</p>

     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>How anxious at heart one gets when one has n't seen herself for months ! One day I got a brand-new dust-pan . When I swept up at seven in the morning I held the back of it up before my face . Tin does n't flatter , but I took pleasure in it all the same .— Bring the picture down from your room . Shall I come too ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>No , Heaven 's sake ! You must spare yourself !</p>

     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>I 've been sparing myself long enough now !<stage>Alva goes out , right , to get the picture .</stage>He has heart-trouble ; but to have to plague one 's self with imagination fourteen months !... He kisses with the fear of death on him , and his two knees shake like a frozen vagabond 's . In God 's name .... In this room — if only I had not shot his father in the back !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Returns with the picture of Lulu in the Pierrot-dress .</stage>It 's covered with dust . I had leant it against the fire-place , face to the wall .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>You did n't look at it all the time I was away ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>I had so much business to attend to , with the sale of our paper and everything . Countess Geschwitz would have liked to have hung it up in her house , but she had to be prepared for search-warrants .<stage>He puts the picture on the easel .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Merrily .</stage>Now the poor monster is learning the joys of life in Hotel Ox-butter by her own experience .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>Even now I do n't understand how events hang together .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Geschwitz arranged it all very cleverly . I must admire her inventiveness . But the cholera must have raged fearfully in Hamburg this summer ; and on that she founded her plan for freeing me . She took a course in hospital nursing here , and when she had the necessary documents she journeyed to Hamburg with them and nursed the cholera patients . At the first opportunity that offered she put on the underclothes in which a sick woman had just died and which really ought to have been burnt . The same morning she traveled back here and came to see me in prison . In my cell , while the wardress was outside , we , as quick as we could , exchanged underclothes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>So that was the reason why the Countess and you fell sick of the cholera the same day !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Exactly , that was it ! Geschwitz of course was instantly brought from her house to the contagious ward in the hospital . But with me , too , they could n't think of any other place to take me . So there we lay in one room in the contagious ward behind the hospital , and from the first day Geschwitz put forth all her art to make our two faces as like each other as possible . Day before yesterday she was let out as cured . Just now she came back and said she 'd forgotten her watch . I put on her clothes , she slipped into my prison frock , and then I came away .<stage>With pleasure .</stage>Now she 's lying over there as the murderess of Dr. Schoen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>So far as outward appearance goes you can still agree with the picture as much as ever .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>I 'm a little peaked in the face , but otherwise I 've lost nothing . Only one gets incredibly nervous in prison .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>You looked horribly sick when you came in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>I had to , to get our necks out of the noose .— And you ? What have you done in this year and a half ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>I 've had a succes d'estime in literary circles with a play I wrote about you .</p>

     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Who 's your sweetheart now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>An actress I 've rented a house for in Karl Street .</p>

     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Does she love you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>How should I know that ? I have n't seen the woman for six weeks .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Can you stand that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>You will never understand that . With me there 's the closest alternation between my sensuality and mental creativeness . So towards you , for example , I have only the choice of regarding you artistically or of loving you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a fairy-story tone .</stage>I used to dream every other night that I 'd fallen into the hands of a sadic .... Come , give me a kiss !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>It 's shining in your eyes like the water in a deep well one has just thrown a stone into .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Come !</p>

     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Kisses her .</stage>Your lips have got pretty thin , anyway .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Come !<stage>Pushes him into a chair and seats herself on his knee .</stage>Do you shudder at me ?— In Hotel Ox-butter we all got a luke-warm bath every four weeks . The wardresses took that opportunity to search our pockets as soon as we were in the water .<stage>She kisses him passionately .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>Oh , oh !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>You 're afraid that when I 'm away you could n't write any more poems about me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>On the contrary , I shall write a dithyramb upon thy glory .</p>

     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>I 'm only sore about the hideous shoes I 'm wearing .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>They do not encroach upon your charms . Let us be thankful for the favor of this moment .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>I do n't feel at all like that to-day .— Do you remember the costume ball where I was dressed like a knight 's squire ? How those wine-full women ran after me that time ? Geschwitz crawled round , round my feet , and begged me to step on her face with my cloth shoes .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>You hold back the fire of my soul with the most dexterous art . And your breast breathes so virginly too . Yet if it were n't for your two great , dark , childish eyes , I must needs have thought you the cunningest whore that ever hurled a man to destruction .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>In high spirits .</stage>Would God I were ! Come over the border with us to-day ! Then we can see each other as often as we will , and we 'll get more pleasure from each other than now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>Through this dress I feel your body like a symphony . These slender ankles , this cantabile . This rapturous crescendo . And these knees , this capriccio . And the powerful andante of lust !— How peacefully these two slim rivals press against each other in the consciousness that neither equals the other in beauty — till their capricious mistress wakes up and the rival lovers separate like the two hostile poles . I shall sing your praises so that your senses shall whirl !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Merrily .</stage>Meanwhile I 'll bury my hands in your hair .<stage>She does so .</stage>But here we 'll be disturbed .</p>

     <stage>A spacious salon in white stucco . In the rear-wall , between two high mirrors , a wide folding doorway showing in the rear room a big card-table surrounded by Turkish upholstered chairs . In the left wall two doors , the upper one to the entrance-hall , the lower to the dining-room . Between them a rococo-console with a white marble top , and above it Lulu 's Pierrot-picture in a narrow gold frame let into the wall . Two other doors , right ; near the lower one a small table . Wide and brightly-covered chairs stand about , with thin legs and fragile arms ; and in the middle is a sofa of the same style ( Louis XV . ) .</stage>
     <stage>A large company is moving about the salon in lively conversation . The men —* Alva *, * Rodrigo *, Marquis * Casti-Piani *, Banker * Puntschu *, and Journalist * Heilmann *— are in evening dress . * Lulu * wears a white Directoire dress with huge sleeves and white lace falling freely from belt to feet . Her arms are in white kid gloves , her hair done high with a little tuft of white feathers . * Geschwitz * is in a bright blue hussar-waist trimmed with white fur and laced with silver braid , a tall tight collar with a white bow and stiff cuffs with huge ivory links . * Magelone * is in bright rainbow-colored shot silk with very wide sleeves , long narrow waist , and three ruffles of spiral rose-colored ribbons and violet bouquets . Her hair is parted in the middle and drawn low over her temples . On her forehead is a mother-of-pearl ornament , held by a fine chain under her hair . * Kadidia *, her daughter , twelve years old , has bright-green satin gaiters which yet leave visible the tops of her white silk socks , and a white-lace-covered dress with bright-green narrow sleeves , pearl-gray gloves , and free black hair under a big bright-green hat with white feathers . * Bianetta * is in dark-green velvet , the collar sewn with pearls , and a full skirt , its hem embroidered with great false topazes set in silver . * Ludmilla Steinherz * is in a glaring summer frock striped red and blue .</stage>

     <p>Say , Mr. Puntschu , have you still got a few Jungfrau shares for me , maybe ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PUNTSCHU</speaker>
     <p>Jungfrau-shares ?<stage>To Heilmann .</stage>The lady means the stock of the funicular railway on the Jungfrau . The Jungfrau , you know ,— the Virgin — is a mountain up which they want to build a wire railway .<stage>To Magelone .</stage>You know , just so there may be no confusion ;— and how easy that would be in this select circle !— Yes , I still have some four thousand Jungfrau-shares , but I should like to keep those for myself . There wo n't be such another chance soon of making a little fortune out of hand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HEILMANN</speaker>
     <p>I 've only one lone share of this Jungfrau-stock so far . I should like to have more , too .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PUNTSCHU</speaker>
     <p>I 'll try , Mr. Heilmann , to look after some for you . But I 'll tell you beforehand you 'll have to pay drug-store prices for them !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGELONE</speaker>
     <p>My fortune-teller advised me to look about me in time . All my savings are in Jungfrau-shares now . If it does n't turn out well , Mr. Puntschu , I 'll scratch your eyes out !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PUNTSCHU</speaker>
     <p>I am perfectly sure of my affairs , my dearie !</p>

     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Who has come back from the card-room , to Magelone .</stage>I can guarantee your fears are absolutely unfounded . I paid very dear for my Jungfrau-stock and have n't regretted it a minute . They 're going up steadily from day to day . There never was such a thing before .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Just say straight out how much you want .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CASTI-PIANI</speaker>
     <p>With money you can no longer serve me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>What makes you think that we have no more money ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CASTI-PIANI</speaker>
     <p>You handed out the last bit of it to me yesterday .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>If you 're sure of that then I suppose it 's so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CASTI-PIANI</speaker>
     <p>You 're down on the bare ground , you and your writer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Then why all the words ?— If you want to have me for yourself you need not first threaten me with execution .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CASTI-PIANI</speaker>
     <p>I know that . But I 've told you more than once that you wo n't be my downfall . I have n't sucked you dry because you loved me , but loved you in order to suck you . Bianetta is more to my taste from top to bottom than you . You set out the choicest sweetmeats , and after one has frittered his time away at them he finds he 's hungrier than before . You 've loved too long , even for our present relations . With a healthy young man , you only ruin his nervous system . But you 'll fit all the more perfectly in the position I have sought out for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>You 're crazy ! Have I commissioned you to find a position for me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CASTI-PIANI</speaker>
     <p>I told you , though , that I was an appointments-agent .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>You told me you were a police spy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CASTI-PIANI</speaker>
     <p>One can n't live on that alone . I was an appointments-agent originally , till I blundered over a minister 's daughter I 'd got a position for in Valparaiso . The little darling in her childhood 's dreams imagined the life even more intoxicating than it is , and complained of it to Mama . On that , they nabbed me ; but by reliable demeanor I soon enough won the confidence of the criminal police and they sent me here on a hundred and fifty marks a month , because they were tripling our contingent here on account of these everlasting bomb-explosions . But who can get along on a hundred and fifty marks a month ? My colleagues get women to support them ; but , of course , I found it more convenient to take up my former calling again ; and of the numberless adventuresses of the best families of the entire world , whom chance brings together here , I have already forwarded many a young creature hungry for life to the place of her natural vocation .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Decisively .</stage>I would n't do in that business .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CASTI-PIANI</speaker>
     <p>Your views on that question make no difference whatever to me . The department of justice will pay anyone who delivers the murderess of Dr. Schoen into the hands of the police a thousand marks . I only need to whistle for the constable who 's standing down at the corner to have earned a thousand marks . Against that , the House of Oikonomopulos in Cairo bids sixty pounds for you — twelve hundred marks — two hundred more than the Attorney General . And , besides , I am still so far a friend of mankind that I prefer to help my loves to happiness , not plunge them into misfortune .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>As before .</stage>The life in such a house can never make a woman of my stamp happy . When I was fifteen , that might have happened to me . I was desperate then — thought I should never be happy . I bought a revolver , and ran one night bare-foot thru the deep snow over the bridge to the park to shoot myself there . But then by good luck I lay three months in the hospital without setting eyes on a man , and in that time my eyes opened and I got to know myself . Night after night in my dreams I saw the man for whom I was created and who was created for me , and then when I was let out on the men again I was no longer a silly goose . Since then I can see on a man , in a pitch-dark night and a hundred feet away , whether we 're suited to each other ; and if I sin against that insight I feel the next day dirtied , body and soul , and need weeks to get over the loathing I have for myself . And now you imagine I 'll give myself to every and any Tom and Harry !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CASTI-PIANI</speaker>
     <p>Toms and Harries do n't patronize Oikonomopulos of Cairo . His custom consists of Scottish lords , Russian dignitaries , Indian governors , and our jolly Rhineland captains of industry . I must only guarantee that you speak French . With your gift for languages you 'll quickly enough learn as much English , besides , as you 'll need to get on with . And you 'll reside in a royally furnished apartment with an outlook on the minarets of the El Azhar Mosque , and walk around all day on Persian carpets as thick as your fist , and dress every evening in a fabulous Paris gown and drink as much champagne as your customers can pay for , and , finally , you 'll even remain , up to a certain point , your own mistress . If the man does n't please you , you need n't bring him any reciprocal feelings . Just let him give in his card , and then —<stage>Shrugs , and snaps his fingers .</stage>If the ladies did n't get used to that the whole business would be simply impossible , because every one after the first four weeks would go headlong to the devil .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Her voice shaking .</stage>I do believe that since yesterday you 've got a screw loose somewhere . Am I to understand that the Egyptian will pay fifteen hundred francs for a person whom he 's never seen ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CASTI-PIANI</speaker>
     <p>I took the liberty of sending him your pictures .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Those pictures that I gave you , you 've sent to him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CASTI-PIANI</speaker>
     <p>You see he can value them better than I . The picture in which you stand before the mirror as Eve he 'll probably hang up at the house-door , after you 've got there .... And then there 's one thing more for you to notice : with Oikonomopulos in Cairo you 'll be safer from your blood-hounds than if you crept into a Canadian wilderness . It is n't so easy to transport an Egyptian courtesan to a German prison ,— first , on account of the mere expense , and second , from fear of coming too close to eternal Justice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Proudly , in a clear voice .</stage>What 's your eternal Justice to do with me ! You can see as plain as your five fingers I sha n't let myself be locked up in any such amusement-place !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CASTI-PIANI</speaker>
     <p>Then do you want me to whistle for the policeman ?</p>

     <p><stage>In wonder .</stage>Why do n't you simply ask me for twelve hundred marks , if you want the money ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CASTI-PIANI</speaker>
     <p>I want for no money ! And I also do n't ask for it because you 're dead broke .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>We still have thirty thousand marks .</p>

     <p>In Jungfrau-stock ! I never have anything to do with stock . The Attorney-General pays in the national currency , and Oikonomopulos pays in English gold . You can be on board early to-morrow . The passage does n't last much more than five days . In two weeks at most you 're in safety . Here you are nearer to prison than anywhere . It 's a wonder which I , as one of the secret police , cannot understand , that you two have been able to live for a full year unmolested . But just as I came on the track of your antecedents , so any day , with your mighty consumption of men , one of my colleagues may make the happy discovery . Then I may just wipe my mouth , and you spend in prison the most enjoyable years of your life . If you will kindly decide quickly . The train goes at 12. 30 . If we have n't struck a bargain before eleven , I whistle up the policeman . If we have , I pack you , just as you stand , into a carriage , drive you to the station , and to-morrow escort you on board ship .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>But is it possible you can be serious in all this ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CASTI-PIANI</speaker>
     <p>Do n't you understand that I can act now only for your bodily rescue ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>I 'll go with you to America or to China , but I can n't let myself be sold of my own accord ! That is worse than prison !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>CASTI-PIANI</speaker>
     <p><stage>Drawing a letter from his pocket .</stage>Just read this effusion ! I 'll read it to you . Here 's the postmark “ Cairo , ” so you wo n't believe I work with forged documents . The girl is a Berliner , was married two years and to a man whom you would have envied her , a former comrade of mine . He travels now for the Hamburg Colonial Company ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Merrily .</stage>Then perhaps he * visits * his wife occasionally ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CASTI-PIANI</speaker>
     <p>That is not incredible . But hear this impulsive expression of her feelings . My white-slave traffic seems to me absolutely no more honorable than the very best judge would tax it with being , but a cry of joy like this lets me feel a certain moral satisfaction for a moment . I am proud to earn my money by scattering happiness with full hands .<stage>Reads .</stage>“ Dear Mr. Meyer ” — that 's my name as a white-slave trader — “ when you go to Berlin , please go right away to the conservatory on the Potsdamer Strasse and ask for Gusti von Rosenkron — the most beautiful woman that I 've ever seen in nature — delightful hands and feet , naturally small waist , straight back , full body , big eyes and short nose — just the sort you like best . I have written to her already . She has no prospects with her singing . Her mother has n't a penny . Sorry she 's already twenty-two , but she 's pining for love . Ca n't marry , because absolutely without means . I have spoken with Madame . They 'd like to take another German , if she 's well educated and musical . Italians and Frenchwomen can n't compete with us , ‘ cause of too little culture . If you should see Fritz ” — Fritz is the husband ; he 's getting a divorce , of course ,— “ tell him it was all a bore . He did n't know any better , nor did I either . ” Now come the exact details —</p>

     <p>Let me read some more .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>As before .</stage>This very evening , I 'll hand over to you our entire wealth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CASTI-PIANI</speaker>
     <p>Believe me , for God 's sake , I 've * got * your last red cent ! If we have n't left this house before eleven , you and your lot will be transported to-morrow in a police-car to Germany .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>You * can n't * give me up !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CASTI-PIANI</speaker>
     <p>Do you think that would be the worst thing I can have done in my life ?... I must , in case we go to-night , have just a brief word with Bianetta .<stage>He goes into the card-room , leaving the door open behind him . Lulu stares before her , mechanically crumpling up the note that Rodrigo stuck into her hand , which she has held in her fingers thruout the dialog . Alva , behind the card-table , gets up , a bill in his hand , and comes into the salon .</stage></p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p><stage>To Lulu .</stage>Brilliantly ! It 's going brilliantly ! Geschwitz is wagering her last shirt . Puntschu has promised me ten more Jungfrau-shares . Steinherz is making her little gains and profits .<stage>Exit , lower right .</stage></p>

     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>I in a bordell ?—<stage>She reads the paper she holds , and laughs madly .</stage></p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coming back with a cash-box in his hand .</stage>Are n't you going to play , too ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Oh , yes , surely — why not ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>By the way , it 's in the Berliner Tageblatt to-day that Alfred</l>
      <l>Hugenberg has hurled himself over the stairs in prison .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Is he too in prison ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>Only in a sort of house of detention .<stage>Exit , rear . Lulu is about to follow , but Countess Geschwitz meets her in the door-way .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>You are going because I come ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Resolutely .</stage>No , God knows . But when you come then I go .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>You have defrauded me of all the good things of this world that I still possessed . You might at the very least preserve the outward forms of politeness in your intercourse with me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>As before .</stage>I am as polite to you as to any other woman . I only beg you to be equally so to me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>Have you forgotten the passionate endearments by which , while we lay together in the hospital , you seduced me into letting myself be locked into prison for you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Well , why else did you bring me down with the cholera beforehand ? I swore very different things to myself , even while it was going on , from what I had to promise you ! I am shaken with horror at the thought that that should ever become reality !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>Then you cheated me consciously , deliberately ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gaily .</stage>What have you been cheated of , then ? Your physical advantages have found so enthusiastic an admirer here , that I ask myself if I wo n't have to give piano lessons once more , to keep alive ! No seventeen-year-old child could make a man madder with love than you , a pervert , are making him , poor fellow , by your shrewishness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>Of whom are you speaking ? I do n't understand a word .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>As before .</stage>I 'm speaking of your acrobat , of Rodrigo Quast . He 's an athlete : he balances two saddled cavalry horses on his chest . Can a woman desire anything more glorious ? He told me just now that he 'd jump into the water to-night if you did not take pity on him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>I do not envy you this cleverness with which you torture the helpless victims sacrificed to you by their inscrutable destiny . My own plight has not yet wrung from me the pity that I feel for you . I feel free as a god when I think to what creatures * you * are enslaved .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Who do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>Casti-Piani , upon whose forehead the most degenerate baseness is written in letters of fire !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Be silent ! I 'll kick you , if you speak ill of * him *. He loves me with an uprightness against which your most venturous self-sacrifices are poor as beggary ! He gives me such proofs of self-denial as reveal * you * for the first time in all your loathsomeness ! You did n't get finished in your mother 's womb , neither as woman nor as man . You have no human nature like the rest of us . The stuff did n't go far enough for a man , and for a woman you got too much brain into your skull . That 's the reason you 're crazy ! Turn to Miss Bianetta ! She can be had for everything for pay ! Press a gold-piece into her hand and she 'll belong to you .<stage>All the company save Kadidia throng in out of the card-room .</stage>For the Lord 's sake , what has happened ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PUNTSCHU</speaker>
     <p>Nothing whatever ! We 're thirsty , that 's all .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGELONE</speaker>
     <p>Everybody has won . We can n't believe it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BIANETTA</speaker>
     <p>It seems I have won a whole fortune !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LUDMILLA</speaker>
     <p>Do n't boast of it , my child . That is n't lucky .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGELONE</speaker>
     <p>But the bank has won , too ! How is that * possible *?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>It is colossal , where all the money comes from !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CASTI-PIANI</speaker>
     <p>Let us not ask ! Enough that we need not spare the champagne .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>HEILMANN</speaker>
     <p>I can pay for a supper in a respectable restaurant afterwards , anyway !</p>

     <p><stage>Holding Lulu back .</stage>Un momong , my heart . Have you read my billet-doux ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Threaten me with discovery as much as you like ! I have no more twenty thousands to dispose of .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>Do n't lie to me , you punk ! You 've still got forty thousand in Jungfrau-stock . Your so-called spouse has just been bragging of it himself !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Then turn to * him * with your blackmailing ! It 's all one to me what he does with his money .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>Thank you ! With that blockhead I 'd need twice twenty-four hours to make him grasp what I was talking about . And then come his explanations , that make one deathly sick ; and meanwhile my bride writes me “ It 's all up ! ” and I can just hang a hurdy-gurdy over my shoulder .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Have you got engaged here , then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>Maybe I ought to have asked your permission first ? What were my thanks here that I freed you from prison at the cost of my health ? You abandoned me ! I might have had to be a baggage-man if this girl had n't taken me up ! At my very first entrance , right away , they threw a velvet-covered arm-chair at my head ! This country is too decadent to value genuine shows of strength any more . If I 'd been a boxing kangaroo they 'd have interviewed me and put my picture in all the papers . Thank heaven , I 'd already made the acquaintance of my Celestine . She 's got the savings of twenty years deposited with the government ; and she loves me just for myself . She does n't aim only at vulgar things , like you . She 's had three children by an American bishop — all of the greatest promise . Day after to-morrow we 'll get married by the registrar .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>You have my blessing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>Your blessing * can * be stolen from me . I 've told my bride I had twenty thousand in stock at the bank .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Amused .</stage>And after that he boasts the person loves him for himself !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>She honors in me the man of mind , not the man of might as you and all the others have done . That 's over now . First they tore the clothes from one 's body and then they waltzed around with the chambermaid . I 'll be a skeleton before I 'll let myself in again for such diversions !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Then why the devil do you pursue the unfortunate Geschwitz with your attentions ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>Because the creature is of noble blood . I 'm a man of the world , and can do distinguished conversation better than any of you . But now<stage>with a gesture</stage>my talk is hanging out of my mouth ! Will you get me the money before to-morrow evening or wo n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>I have no money .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>I 'll have hen-droppings in my head before I 'll let myself be put off with that ! He 'll give you his last cent if you 'll only do your damned duty once ! You lured the poor lad here , and now he can see where to scare up a suitable engagement for his accomplishments .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>What has it to do with you if he wastes his money with women or at cards ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>Do you absolutely * want *, then , to throw the last penny that his father earned by his paper into the jaws of this rapacious pack ? You 'll make four people happy if you 'll not take things too exactly and sacrifice yourself for a beneficent purpose ! Has it got to be only Casti-Piani * forever *?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Lightly .</stage>Shall I ask him perhaps to light you down the stairs ?</p>

     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>As you wish , countess ! If I do n't get the twenty thousand marks by to-morrow evening , I make a statement to the police and your court has an end . Auf Wiedersehen !<stage>Heilmann enters , breathless , upper right .</stage></p>

You must go to bed , now and then , with a story .— Cry , that 's right , cry it all out . It used to shake you just so fifteen years ago . Nobody has screamed since then , the way you could scream ! You did n't wear any white tufts on your head then , nor any transparent stockings on your legs : you had neither shoes nor stockings then .</p>

     <p>You can take them out before you let him down . He does n't notice anything when he 's drunk .</p>

     <p>And then , child — what then ?</p>

     <p>Well ? Is your tongue frozen on you ?</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>What does it ? I 'll fasten it for you if you 'll keep still .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>That augurs misfortune !</p>

     <p><stage>Yawning .</stage>Not for you , child . Cheer up , I 'll look after him !<stage>Exit . Lulu puts her left foot on a foot-stool , fastens her garter , and goes out into the card-room . Then Rodrigo is cuffed in from the dining-room , lower left , by Casti-Piani .</stage></p>

     <p>You can treat me decently anyway !</p>

     <speaker>CASTI-PIANI</speaker>
     <p><stage>Still perfectly unemotional .</stage>Whatever would induce me to do that ? I will know what you said to her here a little while ago .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>Then you can be very fond of me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CASTI-PIANI</speaker>
     <p>Will you bandy words with me , dog ? You demanded that she go up in the lift with you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>That 's a shameless , perfidious lie !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CASTI-PIANI</speaker>
     <p>She told me so herself . You threatened to denounce her if she did n't go with you .— Shall I shoot you on the spot ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>The shameless hussy ! As if anything like that could occur to me !— Even if I should want to have her , God knows I do n't first need to threaten her with prison !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CASTI-PIANI</speaker>
     <p>Thank you . That 's all I wanted to know .<stage>Exit , upper left .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>Such a hound ! A fellow I could throw up onto the roof so he 'd stick like a Limburger cheese !— Come back here , so I can wind your guts round your neck . That would be even better !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Enters , lower left ; merrily .</stage>Where were you ? I 've been hunting for you like a pin .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>I 've shown * him * what it means to start anything with me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Whom ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>Your Casti-Piani ! What made you tell him , you slut , that I wanted to seduce you ? !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Did you not ask me to give myself to my deceased husband 's son for twenty thousand in Jungfrau shares ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>Because it 's your duty to take pity on the poor young fellow ! You shot away his father before his nose in the very best years of life ! But your Casti-Piani will think it over before he comes into my sight again . I gave him one in the basket that made the tripes fly to heaven like Roman candles . If you 've got no better substitute for me , then I 'm sorry ever to have had your favor !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Lady Geschwitz is in the fearfullest case . She twists herself up in fits . She 's at the point of jumping into the water if you let her wait any longer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>What 's the beast waiting for ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>For you , to take her with you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>Then give her my regards , and she can jump into the water .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>She 'll lend me twenty thousand marks to save me from destruction if you will preserve her from it herself . If you 'll take her off to-night , I 'll deposit twenty thousand marks to-morrow in your name at any bank you say .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>And if I do n't take her off with me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Denounce me ! Alva and I are dead broke .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Devil and damnation !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>You make four people happy if you do n't take things too exactly and sacrifice yourself for a beneficent purpose .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>That wo n't go ; I know that , beforehand . I 've tried that out enough now . Who counts on an honorable soul like that in a bag o ’ bones ! What the person had for me was her being an aristocrat . My behavior was as gentleman-like , and more , as you could find among German circus-people . If I 'd only just pinched her in the calves once !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Watchfully .</stage>She is still a virgin .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sighing .</stage>If there 's a God in heaven , you 'll get paid for your jokes some day ! I prophesy that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Geschwitz waits . What shall I tell her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>My very best wishes , and I am perverse .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>I will deliver that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>Wait a sec . Is it certain sure I get twenty thousand marks from her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Ask herself !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RODRIGO</speaker>
     <p>Then tell her I 'm ready . I await her in the dining-room . I must just first look after a barrel of caviare .<stage>Exit , left . Lulu opens the rear door and calls in a clear voice “ Martha ! ” Countess Geschwitz enters , closing the door behind her .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pleased .</stage>Dear heart , you can save me from death to-night .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>How ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>By going to a certain house with the acrobat .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>What for , dear ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>He says you must belong to him this very night or he 'll denounce me to-morrow .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>You know I can n't belong to any man . My fate has not permitted that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>If you do n't please him , that 's his own fix . Why has he fallen in love with you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>But he 'll get as brutal as a hangman . He 'll revenge himself for his disappointment and beat my head in . I 've been thru that already .... Can you not possibly spare me this hardest test ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>What will you gain by his denouncing me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>I have still enough of my fortune to take us to America together in the steerage . There you 'd be safe from all your pursuers .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pleased and gay .</stage>I want to stay here . I can never be happy in any other city . You must tell him that you can n't live without him . Then he 'll feel flattered and be gentle as a lamb . You must pay the coachman , too : give him this paper with the address on it . 376 is a sixth-class hotel where they 're expecting you with him this evening .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p><stage>Shuddering .</stage>How can such a monstrosity save your life ? I do n't understand that . You have conjured up to torture me the most terrible fate that can fall upon outlawed me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Watchful .</stage>Perhaps the encounter will cure you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sighing .</stage>O Lulu , if an eternal retribution does exist , I hope I may not have to answer then for you . I cannot make myself believe that no God watches over us . Yet you are probably right that there is nothing there , for how can an insignificant worm like me have provoked his wrath so as to experience only horror there where all living creation swoons for bliss ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>You need n't complain . When you * are * happy you 're a hundred thousand times happier than one of us ordinary mortals ever is !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>I know that too ! I envy no one ! But I am still waiting . You have deceived me so often already .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>I am yours , my darling , if you quiet Mr. Acrobat till to-morrow . He only wants his vanity placated . You must beseech him to take pity on you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>And to-morrow ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>I await you , my heart . I shall not open my eyes till you come : see no chambermaid , receive no hair-dresser , not open my eyes before you are with me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>Then let him come .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>But you must throw yourself at his head , dear ! Have you got the house-number ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>Three-seventy-six . But quick now !</p>

     <p>Good-night , children !<stage>Accompanies them into the corridor .... then quickly returns with Bob .</stage>Quick , quick , Bob ! We must get away this moment ! You escort me ! But we must change clothes !</p>

     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Oh what , gracious lady ! You give me your clothes and put on mine . Come !<stage>Exeunt into the dining-room . Noise in the card-room , the doors are torn open , and Puntschu , Heilmann , Alva , Bianetta , Magelone , Kadidia and Ludmilla enter , Heilmann holding a piece of paper with a glowing Alpine peak at its top .</stage></p>

     <p>Now he 's got cold feet , the filthy Jew !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PUNTSCHU</speaker>
     <p>How have I given up the game ? How have I got cold feet ? The gentleman has merely to lay plain cash ! Is this my banking-office I 'm in ? He can proffer me his trash to-morrow morning !</p>

     <p>Yesterday it was at 210 , you 're right . To-day , it 's just nowhere . And to-morrow you 'll find nothing cheaper or more tasteful to paper your stairs with .</p>

   </div>
   <div type="act" n="3">
    <head type="act">ACT III</head>
    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>An attic room , without windows , but with two sky-lights , under one of which stands a bowl filled with rain-water . Down right , a door thru a board partition into a sort of cubicle under the slanting roof . Near it , a wobbly flower-table with a bottle and a smoking oil-lamp on it . Upper right , a worn-out couch . Door centre ; near it , a chair without a seat . Down left , below the entrance door , a torn gray mattress . None of the doors can shut tight .</stage>
     <stage>The rain beats on the roof . Schigolch in a long gray overcoat lies on the mattress ; Alva on the couch , wrapped in a plaid whose straps still hang on the wall above him .</stage>
    </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>The rain 's drumming for the parade .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>Cheerful weather for her first appearance ! I dreamt just now we were dining together at Olympia . Bianetta was still with us . The table-cloth was dripping on all four sides with champagne .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>Ya , ya . And I was dreaming of a Christmas pudding .<stage>Lulu appears , back , barefoot , in a torn black dress , but with her hair falling to her shoulders .</stage>Where have you been ? Curling your hair first ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>She only does that to revive old memories .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>If one could only get warmed , just a little , from one of you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>Will you enter barefoot on your pilgrimage ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>The first step always costs all kinds of moaning and groaning . Twenty years ago it was no whit better , and what she has learned since then ! The coals only have to be blown . When she 's been at it a week , not ten locomotives will hold her in our miserable attic .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>The bowl is running over .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>What shall I do with the water ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>Pour it out the window .<stage>Lulu gets up on the chair and empties the bowl thru the sky-light .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>It looks as if the rain would let up at last .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>Your wasting the time when the clerks go home after supper .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Would to God I were lying somewhere where no step would wake me any more !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>Would I were , too ! Why prolong this life ? Let 's rather starve to death together this very evening in peace and concord ! Is it not the last stage now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Why do n't * you * go out and get us something to eat ? You 've never earned a penny in your whole life !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>In this weather , when no one would kick a dog from his door ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>But me ! I , with the little blood I have left in my limbs , I am to stop your mouths !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>I do n't touch a farthing of the money !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>Let her go , just ! I long for one more Christmas pudding ; then I 've had enough .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>And I long for one more beefsteak and a cigarette ; then die ! I was just dreaming of a cigarette , such as has never yet been smoked !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>She 'll see us put an end to before her eyes , before doing herself a little pleasure .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>The people on the street will sooner leave cloak and coat in my hands than go with me for nothing ! If you had n't sold my clothes , I at least would n't need to be afraid of the lamp-light . I 'd like to see the woman who could earn anything in the rags I 'm wearing on my body !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>I have left nothing human untried . As long as I had money I spent whole nights making up tables with which one could n't help winning against the cleverest card-sharps . And yet evening after evening I lost more than if I had shaken out gold by the pailful . Then I offered my services to the courtesans ; but they do n't take anyone without the stamps of the courts , and they see at the first glance if one 's related to the guillotine or not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>Ya , ya .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>I spared myself no disillusionments ; but when I made jokes , they laughed at * me *, and when I behaved as respectable as I am , they boxed my ears , and when I tried being smutty , they got so chaste and maidenly that my hair stood up on my head for horror . He who has not prevailed over society , they have no confidence in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>Wo n't you kindly put on your boots now , child ? I do n't think I shall grow much older in this lodging . It 's months since I had any feeling in the ends of my toes . Toward midnight , I 'll drink a bit more down in the pub . The lady that keeps it told me yesterday I seemed to really want to be her lover .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>In the name of the three devils , I 'll go down !<stage>She puts to her mouth the bottle on the flower-table .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>So they can smell your stink a half-hour off !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>I sha n't drink it all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>You wo n't go down . You 're my woman . You sha n't go down . I forbid it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>What would you forbid your woman when you can n't support yourself ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>Whose fault is that ? Who but my woman has laid me on the sick-bed ?</p>

     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Am I sick ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>Who has trailed me thru the dung ? Who has made me my father 's murderer ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Did * you * shoot him ? He did n't lose much , but when I see you lying there I could hack off both my hands for having sinned so against my judgment !<stage>She goes out , into her room .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>She infected me from her Casti-Piani . It 's a long time since she was susceptible to it herself !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>Little devils like her can n't begin putting up with it too soon , if angels are ever going to come out of them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>She ought to have been born Empress of Russia . Then she 'd have been in the right place . A second Catherine the Second !<stage>Lulu re-enters with a worn-out pair of boots , and sits on the floor to put them on .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>If only I do n't go headfirst down the stairs ! Ugh , how cold ! Is there anything in the world more dismal than a daughter of joy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>Patience , patience ! She 's only got to take the right road into the business at the start .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>It 's all right with me ! Nothing 's wrong with me any more .<stage>Puts the bottle to her lips .</stage>That warms one ! O accursed !<stage>Exit .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>When we hear her coming , we must creep into my cubby-hole awhile .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>I 'm damned sorry for her ! When I think back .... I grew up with her in a way , you know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>She 'll hold out as long as I live , anyway .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>We treated each other at first like brother and sister . Mama was still living then . I met her by chance one morning when she was dressing . Dr. Goll had been called for a consultation . Her hair-dresser had read my first poem , that I 'd had printed in “ Society ": “ Follow thy pack far over the mountains ; it will return again , covered with sweat and dust — ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , ya !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>And then she came , in rose-colored muslin , with nothing under it but a white satin slip — for the Spanish ambassador 's ball . Dr. Goll seemed to feel his death near . He asked me to dance with her , so she should n't cause any mad acts . Papa meanwhile never turned his eyes from us , and all thru the waltz she was looking over my shoulder , only at him .... Afterwards she shot him . It is unbelievable .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>I 've only got a very strong doubt whether anyone will bite any more .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>I should n't like to advise it to anybody !<stage>Schigolch grunts .</stage>At that time , tho she was a fully developed woman , she had the expression of a five-year-old , joyous , utterly healthy child . And she was only three years younger than me then — but how long ago it is now ! For all her immense superiority in matters of practical life , she let me explain “ Tristan and Isolde ” to her — and how entrancingly she could listen ! Out of the little sister who at her marriage still felt like a school-girl , came the unhappy , hysterical artist 's wife . Out of the artist 's wife came then the spouse of my blessed father , and out of * her * came , then , my mistress . Well , so that is the way of the world . Who will prevail against it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>If only she does n't skid away from the gentlemen with honorable intentions and bring us up instead some vagabond she 's exchanged her heart 's secrets with .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>I kissed her for the first time in her rustling bridal dress . But afterwards she did n't remember it .... All the same , I believe she had thought of me even in my father 's arms . It can n't have been often with him : he had his best time behind him , and she deceived him with coachman and boot-black ; but when she did give herself to him , then I stood before her soul . Thru that , too , without my realizing it , she attained this dreadful power over me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>There they are !<stage>Heavy steps are heard mounting the stairs .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Starting up .</stage>I will not endure it ! I 'll throw the fellow out !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Wearily picks himself up , takes Alva by the collar and cuffs him toward the left .</stage>Forward , forward ! How is the young man to confess his trouble to her with us two sprawling round here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>But if he demands other things — low things — of her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>If , well , if ! What more will he demand of her ? He 's only a man like the rest of us !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>We must leave the door open .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pushing Alva in , right .</stage>Nonsense ! Lie down !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>I 'll hear it soon enough . Heaven spare him !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Closing the door , from inside .</stage>Shut up !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Faintly .</stage>He 'd better look out !<stage>Lulu enters , followed by Hunidei , a gigantic figure with a smooth-shaven , rosy face , sky-blue eyes , and a friendly smile . He wears a tall hat and overcoat and carries a dripping umbrella .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Here 's where I live .<stage>Hunidei puts his finger to his lips and looks at Lulu significantly . Then he opens his umbrella and puts it on the floor , rear , to dry .</stage>Of course , I know it is n't very comfortable here .<stage>Hunidei comes forward and puts his hand over her mouth .</stage>What do you mean me to understand by that ?<stage>Hunidei puts his hand over her mouth , and his finger to his lips .</stage>I do n't know what that means .<stage>Hunidei quickly stops her mouth . Lulu frees herself .</stage>We 're quite alone here . No one will hear us .<stage>Hunidei lays his finger on his lips , shakes his head , points at Lulu , opens his mouth as if to speak , points at himself and then at the door .</stage>Herr Gott , he 's a monster !<stage>Hunidei stops her mouth ; then goes rear , folds up his overcoat and lays it over the chair near the door ; then comes down with a broad smile , takes Lulu 's head in both his hands and kisses her on the forehead . The door , right , half opens .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>She could n't have brought up anything drearier !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Stepping back .</stage>I hope you 're going to give me something !<stage>Hunidei stops her mouth and presses a gold-piece in her hand , then looks at her uncertain , questioningly , as she examines it and throws it from one hand to the other .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>All right , it 's good .<stage>Puts it into her pocket . Hunidei quickly stops her mouth , gives her a few silver coins , and glances at her commandingly .</stage>Oh , that 's nice of you !<stage>Hunidei leaps madly about the room , brandishing his arms and staring upward in despair . Lulu cautiously nears him , throws an arm round him and kisses him on the mouth . Laughing soundlessly , he frees himself from her and looks questioningly . She takes up the lamp and opens the door to her room . He goes in smiling , taking off his hat . The stage is dark save for what light comes thru the cracks of the door . Alva and Schigolch creep out on all fours .</stage></p>

     <p><stage>Behind him .</stage>Wait .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>One can hear nothing here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>You 've heard that often enough !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>I will kneel before her door .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>Little mother 's sonny !<stage>Presses past Alva , gropes across the stage to Hunidei 's coat , and searches the pockets . Alva crawls to Lulu 's door .</stage>Gloves , nothing more !<stage>Turns the coat round , searches the inside pockets , pulls a book out that he gives to Alva .</stage>Just see what that is .<stage>Alva holds the book to the light .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Wearily deciphering the title-page .</stage>Warnings to pious pilgrims and such as wish to be so . Very helpful . Price , 2 s. 6 d .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>It looks to me as if God had left * him * pretty completely .<stage>Lays the coat over the chair again and makes for the cubby-hole .</stage>There 's nothing doing with these people . The country 's best time 's behind it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>Life is never as bad as it 's painted .<stage>He , too , creeps back .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>Not even a silk muffler he 's got and yet in Germany we creep on our bellies before this rabble .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>Come , let 's vanish again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>She only thinks of herself , and takes the first man that runs across her path . Hope the dog remembers her the rest of his life !<stage>They disappear , left , shutting the door behind them . Lulu re-enters , setting the lamp on the table . Hunidei follows .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Will you come to see me again ?<stage>Hunidei stops her mouth . She looks upward in a sort of despair and shakes her head . Hunidei , putting his coat on , approaches her grinning ; she throws her arms around his neck ; he gently frees himself , kisses her hand , and turns to the door . She starts to accompany him , but he signs to her to stay behind and noiselessly leaves the room . Schigolch and Alva re-enter .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Tonelessly .</stage>How he has stirred me up !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>How much did he give you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>As before .</stage>Here it is ! All ! Take it ! I 'm going down again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>We can still live like princes up here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>He 's coming back .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>Then let 's just retire again , quick .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>He 's after his prayer-book . Here it is . It must have fallen out of his coat .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Listening .</stage>No , that is n't he . That 's some one else .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>Some one 's coming up . I hear it quite plainly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Now there 's some one tapping at the door . Who may that be ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>Probably a good friend he 's recommended us to . Come in !<stage>Countess Geschwitz enters , in poor clothes , with a canvas roll in her hand .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p><stage>To Lulu .</stage>If I 've come at a bad time , I 'll turn around again . The truth is , I have n't spoken to a living soul for ten days . I must just tell you right off , I have n't got any money . My brother never answered me at all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>Your ladyship would now like to stretch her feet out under our table ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Tonelessly .</stage>I 'm going down again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>Where are you going in this pomp ?— However , I come not wholly empty-handed . I bring you something else . On my way here an old-clothes man offered me twelve shillings for it , but I could not force myself to part from it . You can sell it , though , if you want to .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>What is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>Let us see it .<stage>Takes the canvas and unrolls it . Visibly rejoiced .</stage>Oh , by God , it 's Lulu 's portrait !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Screaming .</stage>Monster , you brought that here ? Get it out of my sight ! Throw it out of the window !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Suddenly with renewed life , deeply pleased .</stage>Why , I should like to know ? Looking on this picture I regain my self-respect . It makes my fate comprehensible to me . Everything we have endured gets clear as day .<stage>In a somewhat elegiac strain .</stage>Let him who feels secure in his middle-class position when he sees these blossoming pouting lips , these child-eyes , big and innocent , this rose-white body abounding in life ,— let him cast the first stone at us !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>We must nail it up . It will make an excellent impression on our patrons .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Energetic .</stage>There 's a nail sticking all ready for it in the wall .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>But how did you come upon this acquisition ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>I secretly cut it out of the wall in your house , there , after you were gone .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>Too bad the color 's got rubbed off round the edges . You did n't roll it up carefully enough .<stage>Fastens it to a high nail in the wall .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>It 's got to have another one underneath if it 's going to hold . It makes the whole flat look more elegant .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>Let me alone ; I know how I 'll do it .<stage>He tears several nails out of the wall , pulls off his left boot , and with its heel nails the edges of the picture to the wall .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>It 's just got to hang a while again , to get its proper effect . Whoever looks at that 'll imagine afterwards he 's been in an Indian harem .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Putting on his boot again , standing up proudly .</stage>Her body was at its highest point of development when that picture was painted . The lamp , kid dear ! Seems to me it 's got extraordinarily dark .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>He must have been an eminently gifted artist who painted that !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Perfectly composed again , stepping before the picture with the lamp .</stage>Did n't you know him , then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>No . It must have been long before my time . I only occasionally heard chance remarks of yours , that he had cut his throat from persecution-mania .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Comparing the picture with Lulu .</stage>The child-like expression in the eyes is still absolutely the same in spite of all she has lived thru since .<stage>In joyous excitement .</stage>The dewy freshness that covered her skin , the sweet-smelling breath from her lips , the rays of light that beam from her white forehead , and this challenging splendor of young flesh in throat and arms —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>All that 's gone with the rubbish wagon . She can say with self-assurance : That was me once ! The man she falls into the hands of to-day ‘ ll have no conception of what we were when we were young .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Cheerfully .</stage>God be thanked , we do n't notice the continual decline when we see a person all the time .<stage>Lightly .</stage>The woman blooms for us in the moment when she hurls the man to destruction for the rest of his life . That is her nature and her destiny .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>Down in the street-lamp 's shimmer she 's still a match for a dozen walking spectres . The man who still wants to make connections at this hour looks out more for heart-qualities than mere physical good points . He decides for the pair of eyes from which the least thievery sparkles .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Now as pleased as Alva .</stage>I shall see if you 're right . Adieu .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p><stage>In sudden anger .</stage>You shall not go down again , as I live !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>Where do you want to go ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>Down to fetch up a man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>Lulu !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>She 's done it once to-day already .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>Lulu , Lulu , where you go I go too .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>If you want to put your bones up for sale , kindly get a district of your own !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>Lulu , I shall not stir from your side ! I have weapons upon me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>Confound it all , her ladyship plots to fish with our bait !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>You 're killing me . I can n't stand it here any more .<stage>Exit .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>You need fear nothing . I am with you .<stage>Follows her .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Whimpering , throws himself on his couch . Schigolch swears , loudly and grumbling .</stage>I guess there 's not much more good to expect on this side !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>We ought to have held the creature back by the throat . She 'll scare away everything that breathes with her aristocratic death 's head .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>She 's flung me onto a sick-bed and larded me with thorns outside and in !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>And she 's still got enough strength in her body to do the same for ten men alright .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>No mortally wounded man 'll ever find the stab of mercy welcomer than I !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>If she had n't enticed the acrobat to my place that time , we 'd have him round our necks to-day too .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>I see it swinging above my head as Tantalus saw the branch with the golden apples !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p><stage>On his mattress .</stage>Wo n't you turn up the lamp a little ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>Can a simple , natural man in the wilderness suffer so unspeakably ? !— God , God , what have I made of my life !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>What 's the beastly weather made of my ulster ! When I was five-and-twenty , I knew how to help myself !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>It has not cost everyone my sunny , glorious youth !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>I guess it 'll go out in a minute . Till they come back it 'll be as dark in here again as in mother 's womb .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>With the clearest consciousness of my purpose I sought intercourse with people who 'd never read a book in their lives . With self-denial , with exaltation , I clung to the elements , that I might be carried to the loftiest heights of poetic fame . The reckoning was false . I am the martyr of my calling . Since the death of my father I have not written a single line !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>If only they have n't stayed together ! Nobody but a silly boy will go with two , no matter what .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>They 've not stayed together !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>That 's what I hope . If need be , she 'll keep the creature off from her with kicks .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>One , risen from the dregs , is the most celebrated man of his nation ; another , born in the purple , lies in the mud and cannot die !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>Here they come !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>And what blessed hours of mutual joy in creation they had lived thru with each other !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>They can do that now , for the first time rightly .— We must hide again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>I stay here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>Just what do you pity them for ?— Who spends his money has his good reasons for it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALVA</speaker>
     <p>I have no longer the moral courage to let my comfort be disturbed for a miserable sum of money !<stage>He wraps himself up in his plaid .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>Noblesse oblige ! A respectable man does what he owes his position .<stage>He hides , left . Lulu opens the door , saying “ Come right in , dearie , ” and there enters Prince Kungu Poti , heir-apparent of Uahubee , in a light suit , white spats , tan button-boots , and a gray tall hat . His speech , interrupted with frequent hiccoughs , abounds with the peculiar African hiss-sounds .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KUNGU POTI</speaker>
     <p>God damn — it 's dark on the stairs !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>It 's lighter here , sweetheart .<stage>Pulling him forward by the hand .</stage>Come on !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KUNGU POTI</speaker>
     <p>But it 's cold here , awful cold !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Have some brandy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KUNGU POTI</speaker>
     <p>Brandy ? You bet — always ! Brandy 's good !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Giving him the bottle .</stage>I do n't know where there 's a glass .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KUNGU POTI</speaker>
     <p>Does n't matter .<stage>Drinks .</stage>Brandy ! Lots of it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>You 're a nice-looking young man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KUNGU POTI</speaker>
     <p>My father 's the emperor of Uahubee . I 've got six wives here , two Spanish , two English , two French . Well — I do n't like my wives . Always I must take a bath , take a bath , take a bath ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>How much will you give me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KUNGU POTI</speaker>
     <p>Gold ! Trust me , you shall have gold ! One gold-piece . I always give gold-pieces .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>You can give it to me later , but show it to me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KUNGU POTI</speaker>
     <p>I never pay beforehand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>But you can show it to me , thoh !</p>

     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Defending herself with all her strength .</stage>Let me be ! Let me be !<stage>Alva , who has risen painfully from his couch , sneaks up to Kungu Poti from behind and pulls him back by the collar .</stage></p>

     <speaker>KUNGU POTI</speaker>
     <p><stage>Whirling round .</stage>Oh ! Oh ! This is a murder-hole ! Come , my friend , I 'll put you to sleep !<stage>Strikes him over the head with a loaded cane . Alva groans and falls in a heap .</stage>Here 's a sleeping-draught ! Here 's opium for you ! Sweet dreams to you ! Sweet dreams !<stage>Then he gives Lulu a kiss ; pointing to Alva .</stage>He dreams of you , Ragapsishimulara ! Sweet dreams !<stage>Rushing to the door .</stage>Here 's the door ! !<stage>Exit .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>But I 'll not stay here ? !— Who can stand it here now !— Rather down onto the street !<stage>Exit . Schigolch comes out .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>— Blood !— Alva !— He 's got to be put away somewhere . Hop !— Or else our friends ‘ ll get a shock from him — Alva ! Alva !— He that is n't quite clear about it —! One thing or t'other ; or it 'll soon be too late ! I 'll give him legs !<stage>Strikes a match and sticks it into Alva 's collar ....</stage>He will have his rest . But no one sleeps here .—<stage>Drags him by the head into Lulu 's room . Returning , he tries to turn up the light .</stage>It 'll be time for me , too , right soon now , or they 'll get no more Christmas puddings down there in the tavern . God knows when she 'll be coming back from her pleasure tour !<stage>Fixing an eye on Lulu 's picture .</stage>She does n't understand business ! She can n't live off love , because her life is love .— There she comes . I 'll just talk straight to her once —<stage>Countess Geschwitz enters .</stage>If you want to lodge with us to-night , kindly take a little care that nothing is stolen here .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>How dark it is here !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>It gets much darker than this .— The doctor 's already gone to rest .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>She sent me ahead .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHIGOLCH</speaker>
     <p>That was sensible .— If anyone asks for me , I 'm sitting downstairs in the pub .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p><stage>After he has gone .</stage>I will sit behind the door . I will look on at everything and not quiver an eye-lash .<stage>Sits on the broken chair .</stage>Men and women do n't know themselves — they know not what they are . Only one who is neither man nor woman knows them . Every word they say is untrue , a lie . And they do not know it , for they are to-day so and to-morrow so , according as they have eaten , drunk , and loved , or not . Only the body remains for a time what it is , and only the children have reason . The men and women are like the animals : none knows what it does . When they are happiest they bewail themselves and groan , and in their deepest misery they rejoice over every tiny morsel . It is strange how hunger takes from men and women the strength to withstand misfortune . But when they have fed full they make this world a torture-chamber , they throw away their lives to satisfy a whim , a mood . Have there ever once been men and women to whom love brought happiness ? And what is their happiness , save that they sleep better and can forget it all ? My God , I thank thee that thou hast not made me as these . I am not man nor woman . My body has nothing common with their bodies . Have I a human soul ? Tortured humanity has a little narrow heart ; but I know I deserve nothing when I resign all , sacrifice all ....<stage>Lulu opens the door , and Dr. Hilti enters . Geschwitz , unnoticed , remains motionless by the door .</stage></p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. HILTI</speaker>
     <p><stage>His accent is very broad and flat .</stage>But I have no more than five shillings on me . I never take more than that when I go out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>That 's enough , because it 's you ! You have such faithful eyes ! Come , give me a kiss !<stage>Dr. Hilti begins to swear , in the broadest north-country vowels .</stage>Please , do n't say that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. HILTI</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Are you married ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. HILTI</speaker>
     <p>Heaven and Hail , why do you think I am married ?— No , I 'm a tutor ; I read philosophy at the University . The truth is , I come of a very old country family . As a student , I got just two shillings pocket-money , and I could make better use of that than for girrls !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>So you have never been with a woman ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. HILTI</speaker>
     <p>Just so , yes ! But I want it now . I got engaged this evening to a country-woman of mine . She 's a governess here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Is she pretty ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. HILTI</speaker>
     <p>Yaw , she 's got a hundred thousand .— I am very eager , as it seems to me ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Tossing back her hair .</stage>I * am * in luck !<stage>Takes the lamp .</stage>Well , if you please , Mr. Tutor ?<stage>They go into her room . Geschwitz draws a small black revolver from her pocket and sets it to her forehead .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p>— Come , come ,— beloved !<stage>Dr. Hilti tears open the door again .—</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. HILTI</speaker>
     <p><stage>Plunging in .</stage>Insane seraphs ! Some one 's lying in there !</p>

     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Lamp in hand , holds him by the sleeve .</stage>Stay with me !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. HILTI</speaker>
     <p>A dead man ! A corpse !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. HILTI</speaker>
     <p>Where d 's it go out ?<stage>Sees Geschwitz .</stage>And there is the devil !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Please , stop , stay !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. HILTI</speaker>
     <p>Devil , devilled devilry !— Oh , thou eternal —<stage>Exit .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rushing after him .</stage>Stop ! Stop !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p><stage>Alone , lets the revolver sink .</stage>Better , hang ! If she sees me lie in my blood to-day she 'll not weep a tear for me ! I have always been to her but the docile tool that could be used for the heaviest labor . From the first day she has abhorred me from the depths of her soul .— Shall I not rather jump from the bridge ? Which could be colder , the water or her heart ? I would dream till I was drowned .— Better , hang !— — Stab ?— Hm , there would be no use in that — — How often have I dreamt that she kissed me ! But a minute more ; an owl knocks there at the window , and I wake up .— — Better , hang ! Not water ; water is too clean for me .<stage>Starting up .</stage>There !— There ! There it is !— Quick now , before she comes !<stage>Takes the plaid-straps from the wall , climbs on the chair , fastens them to a hook in the door-post , puts her head thru them , kicks the chair away , and falls to the ground .</stage>Accursed life !— Accursed life !— Could it be before me still ? ?— Let me speak just once to thy heart , my angel ! But thou art cold !— I am not to go yet ! Perhaps I am even to have been happy once .— Listen to him , Lulu ! I am not to go yet !<stage>She drags herself before Lulu 's picture , sinks to her knees and folds her hands .</stage>My adored angel ! My love ! My star !— Have mercy upon me , pity me , pity me , pity me !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Lulu opens the door , and Jack enters — a thick-set man of elastic movements , with a pale face , inflamed eyes , arched and heavy brows , a drooping mustache , thin imperial and shaggy whiskers , and fiery red hands with gnawed nails . His eyes are fixed on the ground . He wears a dark overcoat and a little round felt hat . Entering , he notices Geschwitz .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JACK</speaker>
     <p>Who is that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>That 's my sister . She 's crazy . I do n't know how to get rid of her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JACK</speaker>
     <p>Your mouth looks beautiful .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Wo n't you spend the night with me here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JACK</speaker>
     <p>No , have n't got the time . I must get home .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>You can tell them at home to-morrow that you missed the last ‘ bus and spent the night with a friend .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JACK</speaker>
     <p>How much do you want ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>I 'm not after lumps of gold , but , well , a little something .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JACK</speaker>

     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Holds him back .</stage>No , no ! Stay , for God 's sake !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JACK</speaker>
     <p><stage>Goes past Geschwitz and opens the cubicle .</stage>Why should I stay here till morning ? Sounds suspicious ! When I 'm asleep they 'll turn my pockets out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>No , I wo n't do that ! No one will ! Do n't go away again for that ! I beg you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JACK</speaker>

     <speaker>LULU</speaker>

    <sp>
     <speaker>JACK</speaker>
     <p>No , that 's too much . You do n't seem to have been at this long ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>To-day is the first time .<stage>She jerks back Geschwitz , on her knees still , half turned toward Jack , by the straps around her neck .</stage>Lie down and be quiet !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JACK</speaker>
     <p>Let her alone ! She is n't your sister . She is in love with you .<stage>Strokes Geschwitz 's head like a dog 's .</stage>Poor beast !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Why do you stare at me so all at once ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JACK</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I got your measure by the way you walked . I said to myself :</l>
      <l>That girl must have a well-built body .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>How can you see things like that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JACK</speaker>
     <p>I even saw that you had a pretty mouth . But I 've only got a florin on me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>Well , what difference does that make ! Just give that to me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JACK</speaker>
     <p>But you 'll have to give me half back , so I can take the ‘ bus to-morrow morning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>I have nothing on me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JACK</speaker>
     <p>Just look , thoh . Hunt thru your pockets !— Well , what 's that ? Let 's see it !</p>
    </sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JACK</speaker>
     <p>We need no light . The moon 's out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Puts the lamp down .</stage>As you say .<stage>She falls on his neck .</stage>I wo n't harm you at all ! I love you so ! Do n't let me beg you any longer !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JACK</speaker>
     <p>Alright ; I 'm with you .<stage>Follows her into the cubby-hole . The lamp goes out . On the floor under the two sky-lights appear two vivid squares of moonlight . Everything in the room is clearly seen .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p><stage>As in a dream .</stage>This is the last evening I shall spend with these people . I 'm going back to Germany . My mother 'll send me the money . I 'll go to a university . I must fight for woman 's rights ; study law ....<stage>Lulu shrieks , and tears open the door .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Barefoot , in chemise and petticoat , holding the door shut behind her .</stage>Help !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rushes to the door , draws her revolver , and pushing Lulu aside , aims it at the door . As Lulu again cries “ Help ! ”</stage>Let go !<stage>Jack , bent double , tears open the door from inside , and runs a knife into Geschwitz 's body . She fires one shot , at the roof , and falls with suppressed crying , crumpling up . Jack tears her revolver from her and throws himself against the exit-door .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JACK</speaker>
     <p>God damn ! I never saw a prettier mouth !<stage>Sweat drips from his hairy face . His hands are bloody . He pants , gasping violently , and stares at the floor with eyes popping out of his head . Lulu , trembling in every limb , looks wildly round . Suddenly she seizes the bottle , smashes it on the table , and with the broken neck in her hand rushes upon Jack . He swings up his right foot and throws her onto her back . Then he lifts her up .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p>No , no !— Mercy !— Murder !— Police ! Police !</p>

     <speaker>LULU</speaker>
     <p><stage>Within , right .</stage>No !— No !— No !— — Ah !— Ah !...</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>After a pause , Jack re-enters . He puts the bowl on the table .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JACK</speaker>
     <p>That * was * a piece of work !<stage>Washing his hands .</stage>I * am * a damned lucky chap !<stage>Looks round for a towel .</stage>Not even a towel , these folks here ! Hell of a wretched hole !<stage>He dries his hands on Geschwitz 's petticoat .</stage>This invert is safe enough from me !<stage>To her .</stage>It 'll soon be all up with you , too .<stage>Exit .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GESCHWITZ</speaker>
