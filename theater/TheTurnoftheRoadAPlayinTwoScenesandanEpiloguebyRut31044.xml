    <head type="scene">SCENE I .</head>
    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>A farm kitchen of the present day . Door at back , opening to yard , and window with deal table on which are lying dishes and drying cloths with basin of water . A large crock under table . A dresser with crockery , etc ., stands near to another door which opens into living rooms . Opposite there is a fireplace with projecting breasts , in which a turf fire is glowing . Time , about eight of a summer evening in July . Mrs. Granahan and Ellen are engaged at table washing and drying the plates after the supper . Thomas Granahan , the grandfather , is seated at fire place and has evidently just finished his stirabout . The strains of a quaint folk-air played on a violin , sound faintly from the inner room .</stage>
    </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>GRANAHAN . Is that the whole of them now Ellen ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>Yes that 's all now but one .<stage>She goes across to grandfather and lifts the plate .</stage>Have you finished granda ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRANDFATHER</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Yes dearie I have done .</l>
      <stage>He pauses and fumbles for his pipe , &amp; c .</stage>
      <l>Is'nt that a fiddle I 'm hearing ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <stage>ELLEN .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Yes</speaker>
     <p>Robbie 's playing the fiddle in the low room .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>GRANAHAN .<stage>Arranging plates on dresser and turning round .</stage>I wish some one would stop that boy 's fool nonsense wi ’ his fiddle . He 's far too fond o ’ playin ’ . It would stand him better to mind his work .<stage>Calls .</stage>Robbie !<stage>Louder .</stage>D'you hear me Robbie ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>Oh , let the boy be , mother . Its the first time I 've heard him at it this week .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>GRANDFATHER .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Och aye</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Let the boy enjoy himself . You 're only young wanst you know ,</l>
      <l>Mary .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>I think it must be a great thing to be a great musician . Sometimes I believe Robbie should try his luck with that fiddle of his . Somehow I know — I feel he is a genius at it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>GRANAHAN . What notions you do have to be sure . To think of a big grown man like Robbie John spending his life-time at an old fiddle .<stage>Sharply .</stage>Blathers and nonsense . Its time that boy was out lookin ’ at the cattle .<stage>Calls .</stage>Are you there Robbie ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Louder .</stage>
    <stage>Robbie John .</stage>
    <stage>ROBBIE JOHN .</stage>
    <stage>From without . The fiddle ceases suddenly and he comes and stands with it in his hand at the door .</stage>
    <stage>Aye .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>GRANAHAN . You 'd better go down to the low field and see the cattle have n't broken through into Aura Boyd 's corn . You could n't keep them beasts in when the flies gets at them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBBIE JOHN</speaker>
     <p>Just one second till I try this again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>GRANAHAN . Now , will you go when I tell you . You and your ould fiddle . It 'll be the death of you yet . Mind what I say .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBBIE JOHN</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Coming through door and standing there .</stage>
      <l>Bad cess to the cattle and Aura Boyd .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRANDFATHER</speaker>
     <p>He 's a tarr'ble unneighbourly man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>GRANAHAN . He 's a cross grained man right enough , but it would n't do to have the cattle trampin ’ and eatin ’ his corn .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBBIE JOHN</speaker>
     <p>I was down there only ten minutes ago when you sent me , and they were eatin ’ there quite peaceable .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>GRANAHAN . Now will you go Robbie John when your mother wants you . Aura Boyd sent over here this forenoon to say if that Kerry cow broke into his field again he 'd have the law agin us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBBIE JOHN</speaker>
     <p>Och , he 's a cross ould cratur . Sure , she had only one foot through the hedge when he turned her .<stage>He sees mother is getting impatient .</stage>All right ; I 'm away .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes back into room , leaves fiddle there , comes into kitchen again and goes out by door to yard .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>GRANAHAN . He 's as ill to drive as the ould mare to meetin ’ a Sundays .<stage>She goes and looks through door into room .</stage>Look at the time it is and your father and Samuel James niver back yet Ellen . They 're terrible late o ’ comin ’ .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>Och , I suppose they 've met some dealer at the fair and are driving a hard bargain as usual .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRANDFATHER</speaker>
     <p>I wonner if they got that foal red off their hands yet . It 'll be a job I 'm thinkin ’ . He was a miserable baste , and tarr'ble broken in the wind .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>Och , trust father to make that all right . I heard Mr. Taylor , of the creamery , say that father could sell you skim milk for cream , better than any man he knew .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>GRANAHAN .<stage>Seating herself at chair beside table at back .</stage>Oh , aye . It 's easy for him to talk , but money 's hard o ’ makin ’ , and if people 's soft it 's their own fault . Only I hope they 've no ’ taken any drink .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRANDFATHER</speaker>
     <p>It 's no fault in a good man if he does take a half-un .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>GRANAHAN . Now , do n't you be startin ’ to talk that way . It 's always the way with them dailers . Muddle the good man 's head with whiskey , and then do him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Standing nonchalantly at table facing front with hands resting on it .</stage>They 'll not muddle father much I 'm thinkin ’ . Besides , Samuel James is with him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRANDFATHER</speaker>
     <p>Samuel James is a cunnin ’ rascal .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>GRANAHAN . Do n't you miscall my son Mr. Granahan . He 's a canny good son and works hard , and is worth more than half-a-dozen men like Robbie John . They 'll no put their finger in his eye .<stage>Goes to door back .</stage>Bliss my heart there 's that sow among the kale . Shoo !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She goes out and is heard shouting .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Laughing .</stage>
      <l>That poor sow . It has the times of it .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <stage>Robbie John enters and sits down near grandfather .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRANDFATHER</speaker>
     <p>Well , son ; what about the cattle ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBBIE JOHN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Weariedly .</stage>Och , they 're all right . I knowed they 'd be all right . It 's always the way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRANDFATHER</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Soothingly .</stage>
      <l>They are a terrible newsance , indeed , Robbie .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBBIE JOHN</speaker>
     <p>But that 's not what troubles me . Why can n't mother leave me alone for just a few minutes till I get some time to myself at the fiddle . I niver touch it but I 'm taken away and sent off somewhere .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Seating herself at chair beside Robbie John .</stage>
      <l>Do n't be cross with her Robbie , dear . She 's anxious about the cattle .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBBIE JOHN</speaker>
     <p>But , Ellen , look here . Any time I can get to have just a tune on that fiddle , someone 's sure to take me away from it . Father sends me out to mend gaps that were mended , or cut turf that was cut , or fodder horses that were foddered . And when he 's away and I might have some chance , mother does the same . Here I 've been workin ’ for the past week , day in and day out , and the very first chance I get , I must run after the cattle or somethin ’ .<stage>Despondently ,</stage>Nobody has any feelin ’ for me here at all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRANDFATHER</speaker>
     <p>Now , now ; Robbie . It 's all for your own good , son , she does it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>And we feel for him , do n't we Grand-da ? You must n't look so cross , Robbie . You know that they think you 're too much wrapped up in that fiddle of yours , and they want to break you off it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBBIE JOHN</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Determinedly .</stage>
      <l>That they never will ; never .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Coaxingly .</stage>
      <l>Oh ! look grandfather at the cross Robbie .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRANDFATHER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gazing amusedly at Robbie John .</stage>Indeed , Robbie , you look like them prize fightin ’ men ye see up in the town .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBBIE JOHN</speaker>
     <p>Well , there ; is that any better .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He smiles half bitterly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>A wee bit . I wish Jennie Graeme seen you with that face . You would n't get your arm round her so easy then ; would he Grand-da ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRANDFATHER</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>A bonny wee girl she is , and has a fine farm and land comin ’ till her .</l>
      <stage>Aside .</stage>
      <l>Boys a dear but these musicians gets the fine weemin .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBBIE JOHN</speaker>
     <p>There , there ; and creamery managers sometimes gets them too , Grand-da .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRANDFATHER</speaker>
     <p>Indeed , that Taylor man will get a body can cook sowans anyway .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Looking through window .</stage>
      <l>Here 's mother .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>GRANAHAN .<stage>Enters and sits down exhausted on chair at side of table next door .</stage>That sows a torment . I just had her out and back she doubles again . She just has me fair out of wind turnin ’ her out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBBIE JOHN</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Rising and making toward door into room .</stage>
      <l>I can go and have some practisin ’ now .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>GRANAHAN . Robbie John , I seen the carts comin ’ up the loanin ’ . Your father will be in , in no time . He 'll no be pleased to see you han'lin ’ that ,<stage>pointing to the fiddle .</stage>just when he comes back .<stage>Starts up as if suddenly reminded .</stage>I must go and get them eggs counted .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Goes out again through door to yard .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>Aye , Robbie ; do n't take it . He 'll just think you 've been playin ’ that all the time he was away . And he 's always that cross after markets , you could n't stand him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBBIE JOHN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sitting down again .</stage>You 're right . I do n't want another talkin ’ to like the last one ; but its hard .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He takes up a stick from fuel beside fireplace and starts whittling it . The rattle of carts is heard . Samuel James passes the window and walks in . He is partially intoxicated , enough only to make him talkative .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>Well , how did the fair go off ?<stage>Samuel James takes off his overcoat , flings it on back of chair beside dresser and sits down heavily .</stage>Ah ! you 've been takin ’ a drop , as usual .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>SAMUEL JAMES .</stage>
    <stage>Scowls at this but does not deny .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>The fair</speaker>
     <p>Oh , it was great value . Sure grand-da he sould the foal for thirty poun ’ .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRANDFATHER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Astonished</stage>Boys a dear but William John Granahan bates the divil . And who took her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SAMUEL JAMES</speaker>
     <p>There was a cavalryman bought her . Boys but Da is the hard man to plaze . We stopped at Muc Alanan 's on the way home and met William John McKillop there , and he toul ’ the oul ’ man he was a fool to let a good horse go at that price , for he was lookin ’ all roads to give him thirty poun ’ for it ; only he could n't get in time for the sale .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRANDFATHER</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Incredulously .</stage>
      <l>Who did you say ? McKillop ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <stage>SAMUEL JAMES .</stage>
    <stage>Laughing .</stage>
    <stage>Aye .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBBIE JOHN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>Sure McKillop has n't two sov'rins in the wide world . He was only takin ’ a rise out of Da .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SAMUEL JAMES</speaker>
     <p>Sure I knowed the ould Yahoo had n't the price of a nanny-goat . But of course , Da tuk it all in for gospel . And me sittin ’ listenin to him tellin ’ ould McKillop what a grand action the foal had and the shoulders the baste had , and the way it could draw thirty hundred up Killainey hill without a pech .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRANDFATHER</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Astonished .</stage>
      <l>William John Granahan makes a tarr'ble fine Sunday School teacher .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SAMUEL JAMES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Grinning .</stage>But to see ould McKillop sittin ’ there as solemn as a judge , drinkin ’ it all in as if gospel and winkin ’ at me on the sly , the ould rascal , and cursin ’ his luck at losin ’ such a bargain .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The voice of William John Granahan can be heard inviting some one to come on . The strains of a fiddle played by uncertain but unmistakeably professional hands , sounds from the same direction .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking out through window into yard .</stage>Who 's that father has got with him Samuel James ? Oh such a dirty looking man !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SAMUEL JAMES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Chuckling .</stage>Da got ahoult of him at Buckna cross roads and right or wrong he 'd have him home wi ’ him to show Robbie John what fiddlin ’ brings a man till .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Severely .</stage>Its my mind that you and father have been stayin ’ too long in the public house , Samuel James .<stage>William John Granahan and tramp fiddler can be seen outside window .</stage>Look at them — comin ’ in ! oh my ; wait till mother sees the pair of them .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>William John Granahan comes in leading a ragged looking bearded tramp with an old fiddle tucked under his arm .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM JOHN GRANAHAN</speaker>
     <p>Now we 're hame , and we 'll get a drop to drink and a bite to eat , Mr . Fiddler .<stage>He goes over to fireplace and stands with his back to the fire .</stage>Take a sate at the fire and warm yourself .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>No one offers a seat to the tramp who stands puzzled looking and swaying in a drunken manner in the kitchen , slightly in front of Samuel James , who remains seated beside dresser engaged in taking off his leggings .</stage>
    <sp>

     <p><stage>To Ellen .</stage>Your pardon noble lady , I intrude . Your pardon signor I incommode you . Times change and so do men .

     <speaker>TRAMP</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps with your permission I may venture to play you a few extracts from my repertoire . I can play to suit all tastes from a simple country ballad to a concerto by Brahms or the great Russian composer Tschaikouski .</p>

    <stage>William John Granahan starts singing two verses of a folk song , the tramp accompanying meanwhile with fiddle , always putting in an extra flourish . The rest all join , even the grandfather beats time with a stick . The door opens and Mrs. Granahan appears seemingly astonished at the uproar . All suddenly cease singing and try to appear innocent , except the tramp , who goes on playing . He suddenly notices the cessation .</stage>
    <stage>TRAMP .</stage>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SAMUEL JAMES</speaker>
     <p>It all depends . Da heard it for the first time to-day and I can tell you it did n't seem fine to him . Coorse a poun ’ or two would ha'e made a differ o ’ opinion same as it done wi ’ you I expect .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>You need n't sneer at me . It was me told Robbie to keep it . He was goin ’ to give it all up . I would n't be so mean as to take it off him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SAMUEL JAMES</speaker>
     <p>Oh you 're an unusual sort of young woman I know but if Robbie John takes my advice , he better choose quick between playin ’ the fiddle and stayin ’ on here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBBIE JOHN</speaker>
     <p>Give up my fiddle . Never .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SAMUEL JAMES</speaker>
     <p>Well you can plaze yourself . I suppose you could make as much by fiddlin ’ as if you stayed on here and waited till we had the place divid among the three of us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>Why I heard from Mr. Taylor that father was worth four or five hundred pounds and then the two farms .</p>

    <stage>GRANDFATHER .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Aye</speaker>
     <p>You 'd be a long time Robbie John earnin ’ that wi ’ your fiddle . Do n't heed his fool talk son . Stay at home and nivir mind the musicians .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>Robbie dear , and I 'm sure Mr. Graeme would never let his daughter marry a penniless fiddler — even if she would herself . I do n't know . She might and she — might n't .</p>

     <speaker>SAMUEL JAMES</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRANDFATHER</speaker>
     <p>Take heed till yourself . I know what 's going on better nor you . Take an ould man 's advice . Settle yourself down and give up that string instrument . Coorse I daresay you may go and become a great man wi ’ it but you 're more like to become a cratur like thon that was in as not . There 's no good runnin ’ risks . And your father , I heerd him say himself , if you make your bed , you 'll lie on it , for he 'll nivir help you out , once you take to the fiddlin ’ .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>ELLEN .</stage>

He holds it in his hands and looks suspiciously at the father .</stage>Now Robbie John listen to what I and your mother have thought about this . For our sake and your own we want you to give up that accursed thing and put it from you .</p>

     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>To Taylor who stands looking over at her .</stage>You have n't been round this way a long time Mr. Taylor . What ailed you , you did n't call ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Oh I was very busy .<stage>He looks at Mrs. Granahan who is writing laboriously . Then goes and examines a fiddle that hangs on the wall .</stage>Ha ! I thought Robbie John had burnt his fiddle and promised to play no more .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>GRANAHAN . Aye so he did , but there 's a strange story wi ’ that thing you 're lookin ’ at . There was a tramp come here one day I was out , and when I come back , I found him playin ’ away on that thing , and the house in an uproar .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Aye ? He left it here then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>GRANAHAN . No , wait till I tell ye . I packed him out o ’ this , and the next thing I heerd about him was when a wheen o ’ weeks ago he was got half dead wi ’ wet and could in the Flough Moss . John McKillop was down for cutting turf , and foun ’ him in a peat hole , wi ’ his hands on the brew , and the ould fiddle beside him .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>ELLEN .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Yes</speaker>
     <p>The poor soul died the next day , and just before he died he asked McKillop to bring over his fiddle to give to Robbie John . Robbie had been kind to him sometime or other , and the poor bein ’ never forgot it .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>TAYLOR .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Ach aye</speaker>
     <p>I do remember hearin ’ somethin ’ about it . They said he had been a big man in his day I think .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>GRANAHAN .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Aye</speaker>
     <p>He was blatherin the day he was here about bein ’ the leader of an ould band or somethin ’ like , now that I call to mind . But indeed I paid no heed till him , for he was part drunk .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Curiously .</stage>
      <l>You did n't get Robbie to burn this one I see .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>GRANAHAN . Well you see , Samuel James said it was a very valuable one and worth fifty poun ’ or more may be . There 's an inscription on it somewhere if you look .</p>

     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taking down fiddle and examining it .</stage>Aye so I see . “ To Nicholas Werner as a token of esteem from his orchestra . Vienna , 1878 . ”</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>Yes poor soul . He was tellin ’ the truth and no one believin ’ .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>And does Robbie never play it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>Not since he promised that I know of . But all the same it must tempt him for I see his eyes fixed on it often enough when he thinks no one 's lookin ’ .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>TAYLOR .</stage>
    <stage>He looks over at Mrs. Granahan who appears to be engrossed in her writing . He is just slipping his arm round Ellen when Mrs. Granahan looks up . He instantly drops his arm .</stage>

     <p>GRANAHAN . Ha'e you that stamp Mr. Taylor ?</p>

     <speaker>No</speaker>

     <p>He 's to be married to Jane Graeme at Christmas and Mr. Graeme 's comin ’ over here to-day to settle about the money .</p>

     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p><stage>Slily .</stage>I wonder who your father will be settlin ’ matters with Ellen , when you get engaged .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>Why , of course — whoever gets me , I suppose .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Well there 's one thing I would n't haggle with him over .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>And what would that be ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>Yourself of course .<stage>He draws her to him and makes to kiss her . Robbie John and Samuel James pass by the window and Ellen immediately slips away from him . When they come in , she lifts a can and goes out by door to yard . Robbie John and Samuel James seat themselves at table .</stage>Leaning against table and nodding to both . ] Well how 's the corn doin ’ ?</p>

     <p>Much the same . Nothin ’ new with you I suppose ?</p>

     <speaker>SAMUEL JAMES</speaker>
     <p>Well they 're goin ’ to settle Robbie the day , that 's all . He 's a lucky boy .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SAMUEL JAMES</speaker>
     <p>You do n't seem as gay hearted as I would expect , does he Mr. Taylor ? You 'd think he was for getting hung or somethin ’ . I suppose ye heerd all about him givin ’ up the fiddle playin ’ ? And the luck o ’ it . To burn his ould fiddle , and then get another a few days after . You 'd think there was some sort of a strange warnin ’ or advice or somethin ’ in it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>It is very strange .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBBIE JOHN</speaker>
     <p>Samuel James do ye remember the time that ould tramp was playin ’ on this fiddle , as he went out that day , down the loney ?<stage>Samuel James nods .</stage>Well , it seemed to me as if he were playin ’ to bring me out after him . D'ye mind the story , Mr. Taylor , about the piper that went off with all the children , and was niver heard tell of again .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>TAYLOR .</stage>
    <stage>Aye .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBBIE JOHN</speaker>
     <p>Well I could feel him drawin ’ me out after him the very same way . And last night , as sure as death , I heard the same uncanny air singin ’ in my ears , and it seemed to be callin ’ me to come out o ’ this .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p><stage>Exchanges startled looks with Samuel James .</stage>Och I suppose the wind or somethin ’ outside . But there 's no doubt Robbie you have a genius for the fiddle . There was a German professor of music at Newcastle the day you won the prize and he was — But its not right of me to make you vexed , now you 've stopped playin ’ .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SAMUEL JAMES</speaker>
     <p>Ach he does n't mind you tellin ’ . Do ye Robbie ? Tell and hearten him up a wee bit .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAYLOR</speaker>
     <p>This German was so struck with your playin ’ that he was lookin ’ for you all roads , but you were nowhere to be found .</p>

     <speaker>ROBBIE JOHN</speaker>

     <p>I ‘ clare to God , there 's somethin ’ out o ’ common wi ’ you or that fiddle , for I had to stop and listen , and me teeth chatterin ’ wi ’ could .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBBIE JOHN</speaker>
     <p>I did wrong I know , but look here Samuel James , as long as I see that thing hangin ’ there , my hands are itchin ’ to hold it , and the tunes I could play — they keep runnin ’ in my head .<stage>Suddenly rising .</stage>I 'll destroy it .</p>

      <stage>Scornfully .</stage>

     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM JOHN GRANAHAN</speaker>
     <p>Now wait till I get it hammered intill ye . Now when that man 's drunk , he 's boun ’ to ha'e been drinkin ’ .<stage>He hesitates and is obviously confused . Then suddenly seems to grasp the idea he wants .</stage>Aye — in a public house o ’ coorse .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JOHN GRAEME</speaker>
     <p>O ’ coorse . What else would he do there but drink .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM JOHN GRANAHAN</speaker>
     <p>Now that man gets drunk .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He looks inquiringly at Graeme</stage>
    <stage>JOHN GRAEME .</stage>
    <stage>Hopelessly .</stage>
    <stage>Aye .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM JOHN GRANAHAN</speaker>

     <speaker>JOHN GRAEME</speaker>
     <p>Well ?</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>GRANAHAN .<stage>Suddenly appearing at door evidently angry .</stage>The more public houses the less drinkin ’ did he say ?

     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JOHN GRAEME</speaker>
     <p>If your son is to marry my daughter , I 'll ha'e none o ’ his music . Its all very well for quality and the like to go strummin ’ on instruments , but its no ’ meant for a sensible farmer .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>WILLIAM JOHN GRANAHAN .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Aye</speaker>
     <p>I agree wi ’ that . But look here . Mind ye a song or two and a bit o ’ a tune on a long winter 's night keeps one from thinkin ’ long and between you and me , it keeps you from the bottle .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JOHN GRAEME</speaker>
     <p>That 's where you and I differs . Supposin ’ he starts playin ’ a dance tune or two , and the neighbours gather in . You like to do the thing dacint , and ye send out for drink , and then it goes from bad to worse . Na . Na . I 'll ha'e none o ’ that .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>WILLIAM JOHN GRANAHAN .</stage>

     <speaker>JANE</speaker>
     <p>I think you do wrong to keep that fiddle hanging up before his eyes , when he has promised never to play again .</p>

     <p>His own choosin ’ . Who flattered him and led him on ? Who kep ’ the fiddle hangin ’ there and would let no one take it down , a continuin ’ temptation till him ? And you , William John Granahan , wi ’ your lust for money . Aye . Lust for money . You could n't abide him heartenin ’ up the house wi ’ a tune or two , but ye 'd brak the boy 's heart sendin ’ him out till work again , and him workin ’ as much as two of Samuel James there . Ye thought he was wastin ’ time and money . D'ye think there 's nothin ’ in this life beyond making money above the rent . I tell you it 's not the money alone that makes life worth livin ’ . It 's the wee things you think nothin ’ o ’ , but that make your home a joy to come back till , after a hard day 's work . And you 've sent out into the coul and wet , the one that was makin ’ your home somethin ’ more than the common . D'ye think them proud city folk will listen to his poor ould ballads wi ’ the heart o ’ the boy singin ’ through them . Its only us — its only us , I say , as knows the long wild nights , and the wet and the rain and the mist o ’ nights on the boglands ,— its only us I say , could listen him in the right way ,<stage>Sobbing .</stage>and ye knowed , right well ye knowed , that every string o ’ his fiddle was kayed to the cryin ’ o ’ your own heart .</p>

     <p>“ The Turn of the Road ” ... is beyond question one of the most sterling products of the Irish literary revival ever seen at the Abbey Theatre . Whether depicting a matchmaker like the astute Mrs. Granahan ... or reproducing the conversation of farmers just returned from fair or market , discussing parish affairs or speculating on harvest prospects , the author is equally delightful and successful .— Irish Times . The “ Turn of the Road ” ... is one of the most successful pieces ever written dealing with Irish life . The author “ Rutherford Mayne ” has drawn his characters with a master 's hand and they stand out clear and distinct .— Freeman 's Journal . The play was of engrossing interest and was a masterpiece of composition which speaks hopefully of the work to be expected of the Ulster School of Drama .— Daily Express . “ The Turn of the Road ” is a brilliantly written comedy characteristic of the County of Down .— Irish Independent . The charm of this little play is delightful and natural ; its comedy is beautifully balanced and its pathos ... superb and admirably restrained .— Evening Herald . “ The Turn of the Road ” is a clever and poetic conception clothed in smart effective County Down dialogue with many bright and sparkling lines . The significance , the pathos , and inherent beauty of the concluding scene is a piece of consummate art .— Belfast Newsletter . The author ... builds his scenes out of simple materials but always with the eye of a craftsman for striking effects and incidents .... The “ Return from Market , ” “ The Marriage Bargain , ” and the last scene ... have the illusion of life , and are in a phrase — which , though blunted by misuse , expresses a real need in Irish Art — “ racy of the soil ” — The Northern Whig . “ The Turn of the Road ” is a cleverly constructed picture of life in a County Down farmhouse , evidently drawn by one who knew his characters or their prototypes in the flesh .— Irish News . It is a play that transports the hedge rows , the farm kitchen with its dresser and turf fire , and above all the real vernacular right into our preception more vividly than an experience . The author has written a remarkable fine play of life , humour , and realism .— Nomad 's Weekly and Belfast Critic . Into the brief compass of his two acts Mr. Rutherford Mayne has compressed the age-long attitude of Ulster towards the arts .... Light is breaking after the long Arctic night . The very existence of this poignant play pregnantly indicates that the old order is changing and must soon give place to the new .— The Lady of the House . The more we see this peasant drama in two scenes and an epilogue , the more we admire its unpretending art and its real greatness .— Belfast Evening Telegraph .</p>
