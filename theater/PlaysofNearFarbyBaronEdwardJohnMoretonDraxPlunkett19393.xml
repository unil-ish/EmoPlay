    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">Believing plays to be solely for the stage , I have never before allowed any of mine to be printed until they had first faced from a stage the judgment of an audience , to see if they were entitled to be called plays at all . A successful production also has been sometimes a moral support to me when some critic has said , as for instance of “ A Night at an Inn , ” that though it reads passably it could never act .</p>
    <p n="2">But in this book I have made an exception to this good rule ( as it seems to me ) , and that exception is “ The Flight of the Queen . ” I know too little of managers and theatres to know what to do with it , and have a feeling that it will be long before it is ever acted , and am too fond of this play to leave it in obscurity . This beautiful story has been lying about the world for countless centuries , without ever having been dramatized . It is the story of a royal court , which I have merely adapted to the stage . The date that I have given is accurate ; it happened in June ; and happens every June ; perhaps in some corner of the reader 's garden . It is the story of the bees .</p>
    <p n="3">As for “ The Compromise of the King of the Golden Isles , ” it is just the sort of play through which those that hunt for allegories might hunt merrily , unless I mention that there are no allegories in any of my plays .</p>
    <p n="4">An allegory I take to be a dig at something local and limited , such as politics , while outwardly appearing to tell of things on some higher plane . But , far from being the chef d'œuvre of some ponderously profound thinker , I look on the allegory , if I have rightly defined it , as being the one form of art that is narrowly limited in its application to life . When the man whose cause it championed has been elected alderman , when the esplanade has been widened , or the town better lighted or drained , the allegory 's work must necessarily be over ; but the truth of all other works of art is manifold and should be eternal .</p>
    <p n="5">Though there is no such land as the Golden Isles and was never any such king as Hamaran , yet all that we write with sincerity is true , for we can reflect nothing that we have not seen , and this we interpret with our idiosyncracies when we attempt any form of art .</p>
    <p n="6">I set some store by the way in which the three lines about Zarabardes are recited , though it is hard to explain in writing a matter of rhythm . But the heartlessness of it can be indicated by a clear pronunciation of the syllables , as though the people that utter these words had long been drilled in a formula .</p>
    <p n="7">The third play , “ Cheezo , ” tells of one of those rare occasions when it is permissible for an artist , and may be a duty , to leave his wider art in order to attack a definite evil . And the invention of “ great new foods ” is often a huge evil .</p>
    <p n="8">“ Cheezo ” is a play of Right and Wrong , and Wrong triumphs . Were not this particular Wrong triumphing at this particular date I should not have thought it a duty to attack it , and were it easily defeated it would not have been worth attacking .</p>
    <p n="9">I have seen it acted with a Stage Curate , rather weak and a little comic ; obviously such a man could be no match for Sladder . Hippanthigh should be of stronger stuff than that : he is defeated because that particular evil is , as I have said , defeating its enemies at present . Nor could there be any drama in a contest between the brutal Sladder and a Stage Curate ; for the spark that we call humour , by whose light we see much of life , comes as it were of two flints , and not of a flint and cheese .</p>
    <p n="10">The three little plays that follow I will leave to speak for themselves , as ultimately all plays have to do .</p>

      <speaker>THE KING 'S POLITICIAN</speaker>
      <p>A man has fled from the Emperor , and has taken refuge in your Majesty 's Court in that part of it called holy .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE KING</speaker>
      <p>We must give him up to the Emperor .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POLITICIAN</speaker>
      <p>To-day a spearsman came running from Eng-Bathai seeking the man who fled . He carries the barbed spear of one of the Emperor 's seekers .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>We must give him up .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POLITICIAN</speaker>
      <p>Moreover he has an edict from the Emperor demanding that the head of the man who fled be sent back to Eng-Bathai .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>Let it be sent .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POLITICIAN</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>: Yet your Majesty is no vassal of the Emperor , who dwells at</l>
       <l>Eng-Bathai .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>We may not disobey the Imperial edict .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POLITICIAN</speaker>
      <p>Yet ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>None hath dared to do it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POLITICIAN</speaker>
      <p>It is so long since any dared to do it that the Emperor mocks at kings . If your Majesty disobeyed him the Emperor would tremble .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>Ah .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POLITICIAN</speaker>
      <p>The Emperor would say , “ There is a great king . He defies me . ” And he would tremble strangely .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>Yet — if ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POLITICIAN</speaker>
      <p>The Emperor would fear you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>I would fain be a great king — yet ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POLITICIAN</speaker>
      <p>You would win honour in his eyes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>Yet is the Emperor terrible in his wrath . He was terrible in his wrath in the olden time .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POLITICIAN</speaker>
      <p>The Emperor is old .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>This is a great affront that he places upon a king , to demand a man who has come to sanctuary in that part of my Court called holy .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POLITICIAN</speaker>
      <p>It is a great affront .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Enter the SEEKER . He abases himself .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SEEKER</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>: O King , I have come with my spear , seeking for one that fled the</l>
       <l>Emperor and has found sanctuary in your Court in that part called holy .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>It has not been the wont of the kings of my line to turn men from our sanctuary .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SEEKER</speaker>
      <p>It is the Emperor 's will .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>It is not my will .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SEEKER</speaker>
      <p>Behold the Emperor 's edict .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>The KING takes it . The SEEKER goes towards the door .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SEEKER</speaker>
      <p>I go to sit with my spear by the door of the place called holy .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Exit SEEKER .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>The edict , the edict . We must obey the edict .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POLITICIAN</speaker>
      <p>The Emperor is old .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>True , we will defy him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POLITICIAN</speaker>
      <p>He will do nothing .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>And yet the edict .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POLITICIAN</speaker>
      <p>It is of no importance .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>Hark . I will not disobey the Emperor . Yet will I not permit him to abuse the sanctuary of my Court . We will banish the man who fled from Eng-Bathai .<stage>To his DOOM-BEARER .</stage>Hither , the Doom-Bearer ; take the black ivory spear , the wand of banishment , that lies on the left of my throne , and point it at the man that shelters in the holy place of my Court . Then show him the privy door behind the horns of the altar , so that he go safely hence and meet not the Emperor 's seeker .<stage>The DOOM-BEARER bows and takes the spear on the flat of both his hands . The shaft is all black , but the head is of white ivory . It is blunt and clearly ceremonial . Exit .</stage><stage>To POLITICIAN .</stage>Thus we shall be safe from the wrath of the Emperor , and the holy place of my Court will not be violate .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POLITICIAN</speaker>
      <p>Had your Majesty scorned the Emperor it were better . He is old and durst not take vengeance .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>I have decided , and the man is banished .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>A HERALD marches in and blows his trumpet .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HERALD</speaker>
      <p>The Ambassador of the Emperor .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Enter the AMBASSADOR . He bows to the King from his place near the door .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>: For what purpose to my Court from Eng-Bathai comes thus the</l>
       <l>Ambassador of the Emperor ?</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>AMBASSADOR</speaker>
      <p>I bring to the King 's Majesty a gift from the great Emperor ,<stage>AMBASSADOR and his men bow</stage>who reigns in Eng-Bathai , the reward of obedience to his edict , a goblet of inestimable wine .<stage>He signs and there enters a page bearing a goblet of glass . He has a pretty complexion and yellow hair falling as low as his chin and curling inwards . He wears a cerise belt round his tunic exactly matching the wine in the goblet he carries .</stage>He prays you drink it , and to know that it was made by vintners whose skill is lost , and stored in secret cellars over a hundred years ; and that the vineyards whence it came have been long since whelmed by war , and only live now in legend and this wine .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>A gift , you say , for obedience .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>AMBASSADOR</speaker>
      <p>A gift from the old wine-gardens of the sun .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>How knew the Emperor that I had thus obeyed him ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>AMBASSADOR</speaker>
      <p>It has not been men 's wont to disobey the Emperor .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>Yet if I have sheltered this man in the holy place of my Court ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>AMBASSADOR</speaker>
      <p>If that be so the Emperor bids you drink out of this golden goblet .<stage>He signs and it is brought on by a bent and ugly dwarf</stage>and wishes you farewell .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>Farewell , you say ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>AMBASSADOR</speaker>
      <p>Farewell .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>What have you in the goblet ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>AMBASSADOR</speaker>
      <p>It is no common poison , but a thing so strange and deadly that the serpents of Lebutharna go in fear of it . Yea travellers there hold high a goblet of this poison , at arm 's length as they go . The serpents hide their heads for fear of it . Even so the travellers pass the desert safely , and come to Eng-Bathai .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>I have not sheltered this man .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>AMBASSADOR</speaker>
      <p>There is no need then for this Imperial gift .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He throws the liquid out of the goblet through the doorway on to the marble . A great steam goes up .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>Neither have I ordered that his head be sent back to Eng-Bathai .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>AMBASSADOR</speaker>
      <p>Alas , for so rare a wine .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He pours it away .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>I have banished him and he is safe . I have neither obeyed nor disobeyed .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>AMBASSADOR</speaker>
      <p>The Emperor therefore bids you choose the gift that he honours himself by sending to your Court .<stage>He signs . Enter a massive NUBIAN with two cups .</stage>The Emperor bids you drink one of these cups .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>The huge NUBIAN moves up close to the KING holding up the two cups on a tray .</stage>
     <stage>The POLITICIAN slinks off . Exit L .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>The cups are strangely alike .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>AMBASSADOR</speaker>
      <p>Only one craftsman in the City of Smiths ever discerned a difference . The Emperor killed him , and now no one knows .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>The potions also are alike .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>AMBASSADOR</speaker>
      <p>Strangely alike .<stage>The KING hesitates .</stage>The Emperor bids you choose his gift and drink .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>The Emperor has poisoned the cups !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>AMBASSADOR</speaker>
      <p>You greatly wrong the Emperor . Only one cup is poisoned .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>You say that one is poisoned ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>AMBASSADOR</speaker>
      <p>Only one , O King ! Who may say which ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>And what if I refuse to do this thing ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>AMBASSADOR</speaker>
      <p>There are tortures that the Emperor never names . They are not spoken of where the Emperor is . Yet the Emperor makes a sign and they are accomplished . He makes the sign with a certain one of his fingers . KING<stage>half to himself</stage>How wonderfully they have the look of wine .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>AMBASSADOR</speaker>
      <p>One is a wine scarcely less rare , scarcely less jubilant in the wits of man , than that which alas is lost .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He glances towards the spot where he threw the other .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>And the other ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>AMBASSADOR</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>: Who may say ? It is the most treasured secret that the</l>
       <l>Emperor 's poisoners guard .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>I will send for my butlers that are wise in wine and they shall smell the cups .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>AMBASSADOR</speaker>
      <p>Alas , but the Emperor 's poisoners have added so wine-like a flavour to their most secret draught , that no man may tell by this means which is their work and which that inestimable wine .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>I will send for my tasters and they shall taste of the cups .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>AMBASSADOR</speaker>
      <p>Alas , so great a risk may not be run .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p>Risks are the duty of a king 's tasters .</p>

      <speaker>AMBASSADOR</speaker>
      <p>If they chanced to taste of the treasure of the Emperor 's poisoners — well . But if they , or any man of common birth , were to taste of the wine that the Emperor sends only to kings , and even to kings but rarely , that were an affront to the Emperor 's ancient wine that could not be permitted .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>It is surely permitted that I send for my priests , who tell by divination , having burnt strange herbs to the gods that guard the Golden Isles .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>AMBASSADOR</speaker>
      <p>It is permitted .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>Send for the priests . KING<stage>mainly to himself</stage>They shall discern . The priests shall make for me this dreadful choice . They shall burn herbs and discern it .<stage>To AMBASSADOR .</stage>My priests are very subtle . They worship the gods that guard the Golden Isles .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>AMBASSADOR</speaker>
      <p>The Emperor has other gods .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Enter L. two priests of the Order of the Sun . Two acolytes follow . One carries a tripod and the other a gong .</stage>
     <stage>The priests abase themselves and the acolytes bow . The AMBASSADOR stands with almost Mongolian calm by the door from which he has not moved since he entered .</stage>
     <stage>The impassive NUBIAN stands motionless near the KING , holding up the cups on a tray .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>The Emperor has honoured me with these two cups of wine that I may drink one of them to the grandeur of his throne . I bid you importune the gods that they may surely tell me which it were well to drink .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FIRST PRIEST</speaker>
      <p>We will importune the gods with the savour of rarest spices . We will send up to them the odour of herbs they love . We will commune with them in silence and they shall answer our thoughts , when they snuff the savour of the smoke of the burning on the tripod that is sacred to the Sun .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>The calm of the AMBASSADOR and the impassivity of the NUBIAN grow ominous . The two priests hang over the tripod . They cast herbs upon it . They pass their hands over it . The herbs begin to smoulder . A smoke goes up . The priests bend over the smoke . Presently they step back from it .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FIRST PRIEST</speaker>
      <p>The gods sleep .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>They sleep ! The gods that guard the Golden Isles ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FIRST PRIEST</speaker>
      <p>The gods sleep .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>Importune them as never before . I will make sacrifice of many sheep . I will give emeralds to the Monks of the Sun .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>The second acolyte moves nearer to the tripod and beats listlessly on his great gong at about the pace of a great clock striking slowly .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FIRST PRIEST</speaker>
      <p>We will importune the gods as never before .<stage>They heap up more herbs and spices . The smoke grows thicker and thicker . It streams upwards . They hover about it as before . At a sign the gong ceases .</stage>The gods have spoken .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>What is their message ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FIRST PRIEST</speaker>
      <p>Drink of the cup upon the Nubian 's left .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>Ah . My gods defend me .<stage>He seizes the cup boldly . He looks straight at the AMBASSADOR , whose face remains expressionless , merely watching . He lifts the cup upon the Nubian 's left a little up from the tray .</stage><stage>He glances towards the priests .</stage><stage>Suddenly he starts . He has seen a strange expression upon the face of the priest . He puts the cup down . He strides a step nearer and looks at his face .</stage>PRIEST !— Priest !—— What is that look in your eyes ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FIRST PRIEST</speaker>
      <p>O King , I know not . I have given the message of the gods .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>The KING continues to search out his face .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>I mistrust it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FIRST PRIEST</speaker>
      <p>It is the message of the gods .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>I will drink of the other cup !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>The KING steps back to his place in the front of his throne where the Nubian stands beside him . He takes the cup upon the Nubian 's right . He gazes at the priest . He looks round at the Ambassador , but sees nothing in that watchful , expressionless face .</stage>
     <stage>He glances sidelong at the priest , then drinks , draining the cup at some length . He puts it down in silence . The face of the Ambassador and the whole bulk of the Nubian remain motionless .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>An inestimable wine !</p>

     <stage>The QUESTIONERS run nimbly up to the two priests and lead them away by the arm .</stage>

      <speaker>THE TWO ACOLYTES</speaker>
      <p>O , O , O. Oh , oh .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>They show extreme horror . The AMBASSADOR bows to the King .</stage>

      <p>You do not leave us at once ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>AMBASSADOR</speaker>
      <p>I go back to the Emperor , whom it is happiness to obey , and length of days .<stage>He bows and walks away . The HERALD marches out , then the AMBASSADOR ; the PAGE , the DWARF and the NUBIAN follow .</stage><stage>Exeunt .</stage><stage>The HERALD is heard blowing upon his trumpet the same notes as when he entered , one merry bar of music .</stage><stage>The tray and two precious cups , one empty and the other full , are left glittering near the KING .</stage>KING<stage>looking at cups</stage>Those are rare emeralds that glisten there ! Yet an evil gift .<stage>To the moaning acolytes .</stage>Be silent ! Your priests sinned strangely .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>The acolytes continue to moan .</stage>
     <stage>Enter one of the QUESTIONERS . He has sweat on his face and his hair has become damp and unkempt .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>QUESTIONER</speaker>

     <stage>Exit QUESTIONER . The acolytes moan on .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>They would have made me drink of a poisoned cup . I say there is poison in that cup . Your priests would have had me drink it .<stage>The acolytes only answer by moans .</stage>Bid them confess . Bid them confess their crime and why it was done , and the Supreme Question shall be spared them .<stage>The acolytes only answer by moans .</stage>Strange ! They have done strangely .<stage>To acolytes .</stage>Why has your priest spoken falsely ?<stage>The acolytes only moan .</stage>Why has he spoken falsely in the name of the gods ?<stage>The acolytes moan on .</stage>Be silent !

      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>What said they at last ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FIRST QUESTIONER</speaker>
      <p>O , the King 's Majesty , they but spake idly .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>What said they ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FIRST QUESTIONER</speaker>
      <p>O , the King 's Majesty , they said nought fitting .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>They muttered so that no man heard them clearly ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FIRST QUESTIONER</speaker>
      <p>They spake . But it was not fitting .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>Did they speak of small things happening long ago ?</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>FIRST QUESTIONER</speaker>
      <p>O , the King 's Majesty , it was not fitting .</p>

      <p>What said they ? Speak !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FIRST QUESTIONER</speaker>
      <p>The man you gave to me , O King , said : “ No man that knew the counsels of the gods , who alone see future things , would say the gods advised King Hamaran ill when they bade him drink out of a poisoned cup . ” Then I put the question straightly and he died .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>The gods ! He said it was the gods !... And the other ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SECOND QUESTIONER</speaker>
      <p>He also said the same , O the King 's Majesty .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>Both said the same . They were questioned in different chambers ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FIRST QUESTIONER</speaker>
      <p>In different chambers , O King . I questioned mine in the Red Chamber . KING<stage>to SECOND QUESTIONER</stage>And yours ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SECOND QUESTIONER</speaker>
      <p>In the Chamber of Rats .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KING</speaker>
      <p>Begone !<stage>Exeunt QUESTIONERS .</stage>So ... It was the gods .<stage>The acolytes are crouched upon the floor . He does not notice them since they ceased to moan .</stage>The gods ! With what dark and dreadful thing have they clouded the future ? Well , I will face it ! But what is it ? Is it one of those things a strong man can bear ? Or is it ——? The future is more terrible than the grave , that has its one secret only . No man , he said , could say that the gods had advised me ill when they bade me drink out of a poisoned cup . What have the gods seen ? What dreadful work have they overlooked where Destiny sits alone , making evil years ? The gods , he said , who alone see future things . Yes , I have known men who never were warned by the gods , and did not drink poison , and came upon evil days , suddenly like a ship upon rocks no mariner knows . Yes , poison to some of them would have been very precious . The gods have warned me and I have not hearkened , and must go on alone : must enter that strange country of the future whose paths are so dark to man ... to meet a doom there that the gods have seen . The gods have seen it ! How shall I thwart the gods ? How fight against the shapers of the hills ? Would that I had been warned . Would I had heeded when they bade me drink of the cup the Ambassador said was poisoned .<stage>Far off is heard that merry bar of music blown by the AMBASSADOR 'S HERALD on his horn .</stage>Is it too late ? There it stands yet with its green emeralds winking .<stage>He clutches it and looks down into it .</stage>How like to wine it is , which is full of dreams . It is silent and dreamy like the gods , whose dreams we are . Only a moment in their deathless minds : then the dream passes .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He lifts up his arm and drinks it seated upon his throne with his head back and the great cup before his face . The audience begin to wonder when he will put it down . Still he remains in the attitude of a drinker . The acolytes begin to peer eagerly . Still he remains upright with the great cup to his lips . The acolytes patter away and the KING is left alone .</stage>
     <stage>Enter the KING 'S POLITICIAN hurriedly . He goes up to the KING and seizes his right arm and tries to drag the cup away from his lips , but the KING is rigid and his arm cannot be moved . He steps back lifting up his hands .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>POLITICIAN</speaker>
      <p>Oh-h !<stage>Exit . You hear him announcing solemnly</stage>King Hamaran ... is dead !<stage>A murmur is heard of men , at first mournful . It grows louder and louder and then breaks into these clear words .</stage>Zarabardes is King ! Zarabardes is King ! Rejoice ! Rejoice ! Zarabardes is King ! Zarabardes ! Zarabardes ! Zarabardes !</p>

       <p>In the Palace of Zoorm ; the Hall of the Hundred Princes . The Princes sit at plain oaken tables with pewter mugs before them . They wear bright grass-green cloaks of silk ; they might wear circlets of narrow silver with one large hyacinth petal rising from it at intervals of an inch . OOMUZ , a Common Soldier , huge and squat , with brown skin and dense black beard , stands just inside the doorway , holding a pike , guarding the golden treasure . The golden treasure lies in a heap three or four feet high near the right back corner . SENTRIES , also brown-skinned and bearded , carrying pikes , pass and repass outside the great doorway .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>MELIFLOR</speaker>
       <p>To us alone the idle hours are given . The sky , the fields , the woods , the summer winds are for us alone . All others put the earth to uses . This or that field has this or that use ; here one may go and another may not . They have each their bit of earth and become slaves to its purpose . But for us , ah ! for us , is all ; the gift of the idle hours .</p>

      <stage>Enter the RAIDERS of the Golden Hoard with spears and , in the other hand , leather wallets the size of your fist ; these they cast on the heap . Nuggets the size of big filberts escape from some so that the heap is partly leather and partly gold . These wallets should be filled with nuggets of lead , about the size described , not one lump of lead and not sawdust or rags . Nothing destroys illusion on the stage more than a cannon ball falling with a soft pat . They look scowlingly at the Princes .</stage>
      <stage>Exeunt the RAIDERS . The Princes have scarcely noticed them .</stage>

       <p>Ah-h !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>They seem to wake as though young and strong out of sleep . There is a great commotion among them . The sentries outside are utterly unmoved . OOMUZ , without sharing any of the excitement of the Princes , now nods his head solemnly as he had once shaken it .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MOOMOOMON</speaker>
       <p>Love ! It must have been that that I felt that day in the twilight as I came back round the peak of Zing-gee Mountain .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>XIMENUNG</speaker>
       <p>You felt it , Moomoomon ? Tell us .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MOOMOOMON</speaker>
       <p>All the air seemed gold , seemed gold of a sudden . Through it I saw fair fields , glittering green far down , glimpsed between clumps of the heather . The gold was all about them , yet they shone with their own fair colours . Ah , how can I tell you all I saw ? My feet seemed scarce to touch the slope of the mountain ; I too seemed one with the golden air in which all things were shining .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>XIMENUNG</speaker>
       <p>And this was Love ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MOOMOOMON</speaker>
       <p>I know not . It was some strange new thing . It was strange and new like this song .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELIFLOR</speaker>
       <p>Perhaps , it was some other strange new thing .</p>

       <speaker>MELIFLOR</speaker>
       <p>So we will follow the Queen .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HUZ</speaker>
       <p>Yes , we will follow .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MOOMOOMON</speaker>
       <p>We shall be a merry company .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELIFLOR</speaker>
       <p>Splendid to see .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>I would follow though I were not guarded for the event . Though the event should befall and we be immune no longer , still I should dare it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELIFLOR</speaker>
       <p>I would dare it if I knew what they would do . But knowing not ...</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MOOMOOMON</speaker>
       <p>What matter ? We are guarded by the event .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>I say I care not .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELIFLOR</speaker>
       <p>Let us drum with our heels and beat with our scabbards against the benches so that we frighten the Queen . She will run from the palace then , and we will go after her with all our merry company .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MOOMOOMON</speaker>
       <p>Yes , let us drum all together . I will give the word . All together and she will run from the palace . We will go after and our cloaks will stream behind us .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HUZ</speaker>
       <p>Brave ! And our scabbards will show bright beneath them .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELIFLOR</speaker>
       <p>No , I will give the word . When she flees from the palace I will follow her first . Crowd not about my cloak as it streams in the wind . We must throw up our heels as we run to make our shoes twinkle . We must show gaily in the little street . Afterwards we can run more easily .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HUZ</speaker>
       <p>Aye , in the street we must run beautifully .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MOOMOOMON</speaker>
       <p>I think that I should give the word when we rattle our scabbards and all drum with our heels ; but I waive the point . But I do not think that the Queen can run far . She has never left the palace . How could she run over the moor as far as Aether Mountain . She will faint at the end of the street and we shall come up with her and bow and offer her our assistance .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELIFLOR</speaker>
       <p>Good , good . It would be cold and rocky on Aether Mountain .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MOOMOOMON</speaker>
       <p>The Queen could never go there over the moor .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HUZ</speaker>
       <p>No , she is too dainty .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>XIMENUNG</speaker>
       <p>They say she could .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELIFLOR</speaker>
       <p>They ; what do they know ? Common workers . What should they know of queens ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>XIMENUNG</speaker>
       <p>They have the old prophesies that came over the fields from the dawn .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELIFLOR</speaker>
       <p>Yet they cannot understand the Queen .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>XIMENUNG</speaker>
       <p>They say her mother went there .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELIFLOR</speaker>
       <p>That was long ago . Women are quite different now .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>XIMENUNG</speaker>
       <p>Well , give the word .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELIFLOR</speaker>
       <p>Nay . You shall give the word , Moomoomon . When you raise your hand we will all drum with our heels together and rattle our scabbards together , and frighten the Queen .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MOOMOOMON</speaker>
       <p>I honour your courtesy , lord of the deep meadows .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELIFLOR</speaker>
       <p>We are ready then . When you raise your hand ——</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>A gust of laughter is heard off , from a far part of the palace .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MOOMOOMON</speaker>
       <p>Hark ! Hark !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELIFLOR</speaker>
       <p>It is the Queen ! She laughed .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HUZ</speaker>
       <p>Could she have guessed ...?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MOOMOOMON</speaker>
       <p>I trust not .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELIFLOR</speaker>
       <p>She — she — cannot have been thinking of us .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MOOMOOMON</speaker>
       <p>She — she — seldom laughs .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HUZ</speaker>
       <p>What can it be ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MOOMOOMON</speaker>
       <p>Perhaps it was nothing and yet ...</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELIFLOR</speaker>
       <p>Yet it makes me uneasy .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MOOMOOMON</speaker>
       <p>It is not that I fear , but , when a queen laughs — it makes a feeling in the palace — as though all were not well .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HUZ</speaker>
       <p>It makes one have forebodings . One cannot help it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELIFLOR</speaker>
       <p>Perhaps ; perhaps later we could return to our gallant scheme ; for the present I think I 'll hide a while .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MOOMOOMON</speaker>
       <p>Yes , let us hide .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELIFLOR</speaker>
       <p>So that if there be anything wrong in the palace it will not find us .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>OOMUZ</speaker>
       <p>Mighty Highness —— ZOON<stage>still to himself</stage>They will come back boasting that they dared follow the Queen .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OOMUZ</speaker>
       <p>Mighty Highness .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>Yes , good Oomuz .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OOMUZ</speaker>
       <p>In other times once princes followed a queen and came back boasting . Master , the workers were angry . Be warned , Master , because you and I went together once to the hoard beyond the marshes . Be warned . They were angry , Master .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>I care not for the workers .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OOMUZ</speaker>
       <p>Master , be warned . It was long ago and they say they were very angry .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>I care not , Oomuz . I come not boasting back from the hills under Aether Mountain . I shall not halt till I have told the Queen my love . I shall wed with her who is less only than Fate , if less she be . I am not as those , Oomuz . Who weds the Queen is more than the servant of Fate .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OOMUZ</speaker>
       <p>Master ——</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>He stretches out his hands towards ZOON imploringly .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>Well , Oomuz ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OOMUZ</speaker>
       <p>Master . There is a doom about the Queen .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>What doom , Oomuz ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OOMUZ</speaker>
       <p>We know not , Master . We are simple people and we know not that . But we know from of old there is a doom about her . We know it , Master ; we have been told from of old .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>Yes , there could well be a doom about the Queen .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OOMUZ</speaker>
       <p>Follow not after , Master , when she goes to Aether Mountain . There is surely a doom about her . A doom was with her mother upon that very peak .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>Yes , Oomuz , a doom well becomes her .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OOMUZ</speaker>
       <p>Doubt it not , Master ; there is a doom about her .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>Oomuz , I doubt not . For there is something wonderful about the Queen , beyond all earthly wonders . Something like thunder beyond far clouds or hail hurling from heaven ; there should be indeed a terrible doom about her .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OOMUZ</speaker>
       <p>Master , I have warned you for the sake of the days when we raided the golden hoard beyond the marshes . ZOON<stage>taking his hand</stage>Thank you , good Oomuz .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>He goes towards door after the others .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OOMUZ</speaker>
       <p>But where go you , Master ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>I wait to follow the Queen when she goes to Aether Mountain .</p>

       <speaker>OOZIZI</speaker>
       <p>Great lady , because such things as sighs pertain only to love .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>Love is a joy , Oozizi ; love is a glow . Love makes them dance so lightly along rays of the sunlight . It is made of sunlight and gladness . It is like flowers in twilight . How should they sigh ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OOZIZI</speaker>
       <p>Lady ! Great lady ! Say not such things of love !</p>

       <p>Say not such things , Oozizi ? Are they not true ?</p>

       <p>Lady ! The common people love .<stage>She points to door .</stage>Lady , the green fields going from here to the blueness , and bending towards it , and going wandering on , and the rivers they meet and the woods that shade the rivers , all own you for their sovereign . Lady , a million lime-trees mellow your realm . The golden hoards are yours . Yours are the deep fields and the iris marshes . Yours are the roads of wandering and all ways home . The common delights of love your mere soldiers know . Lady , you may not love .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>The QUEEN sighs . OOZIZI continues her knitting .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>My mother loved , Oozizi .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OOZIZI</speaker>
       <p>Lady , for a day . For one day , mighty lady , As one might stoop in idleness to a broken toy and pick it up and throw it again away , so she loved for a day . That idle fancy of an afternoon tarnished no pinnacle that shone from her exalted station . But to love for more than a day —<stage>QUEEN 'S face lights up</stage>— that were to place your high unequalled glory below a vulgar pastime . One alone may sit in the golden palace to reign over the green fields ; but all may love .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>Do all love but I , Oozizi ?</p>

       <p>And yet I would fain go over those green fields all gleaming with summer , and see the golden hoards that no man guards , glittering with such a light as glows this June .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OOZIZI</speaker>
       <p>O , speak not , great lady , of the green fields and June . It is these that have intoxicated the Princes so that they do this unrecorded thing , letting sound of them be heard in your sacred room .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>Has June intoxicated them , Oozizi ?</p>

       <speaker>OOZIZI</speaker>
       <p>It does strange things .<stage>The noise breaks out again .</stage>Hark !<stage>The QUEEN runs to the door again . OOZIZI stretches out her arms to the QUEEN .</stage>O , lady , never leave the golden palace .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>The QUEEN listens ; all is silent ; she looks outside .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>I see the green fields gleaming . Strange flowers are standing among them , like princes I have not known .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OOZIZI</speaker>
       <p>Oh , lady , speak not of the bewildering fields . They are all enchanted with Summer , and they have maddened the Princes . It is dangerous to look at them , lady .<stage>The QUEEN gazes on over the fields .</stage>And yet you look .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>I would fain go far over the strange soft fields ; far and far to the high heathery lands ——</p>

       <p>Lady , all is quiet ; there is no danger ; you must not leave the palace .</p>

      <stage>The QUEEN returns .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OOZIZI</speaker>
       <p>It was a passing madness seized the Princes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>Oozizi , when I hear the sound of all their feet it is dreadful , and I must fly . And when I see the wonderful fields in the sunlight sloping away to lands I have never known , then I long to fly away and away for ever , passing from field to field and land to land .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>

       <p>There is a mountain there that towers above the earth . It goes up into a calm of which our world knows nothing . Heaven , like a cloak , is draped about its shoulders . Why have none told me of this mountain , Oozizi ? OOZIZI<stage>awed</stage>Aether Mountain .</p>

Come with me but a little while .<stage>She leads the QUEEN slowly by the arm back to the throne .</stage>Lady , be seated here once more and take up the orb and sceptre in your small hands as of old .<stage>The QUEEN patiently does as she is told .</stage>Now , if Destiny calls you , let him call to you as to a Queen . Now , if it be for no whim of those that pass , that you would go so far from here to that great mountain , say , seated upon your throne in the golden palace with sceptre and orb in hand , say would you go forth , lady ? QUEEN<stage>almost dreaming</stage>Aether Mountain calls .</p>

      <stage>Entranced , silent , last of all ZOON follows . Exeunt all the Princes . Sounds as of rough protest heard from the workers off . The grim brown heads of two or three peer round the door by which the Princes entered . Many come on , dumb , puzzled , turning their brown heads , searching . At last they cluster round OOZIZI . “ Er ” ? they say .</stage>

       <p>Can you doubt it ?</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>: No . It was a dream . Just now I dreamt it . Are dreams bad , my</l>
        <l>Prince ?</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>No . They are just dreams .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>We will think of dreams no more .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>This is where love is , and here only . We should not dream too much or think of dreams , because the place is holy .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>Is love here only , darling ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>Here only , Golden Queen . Do any others elsewhere love as we .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>No , I think not .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>Then how can pure love be elsewhere ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>It is true .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>On this clear peak that just enters Heaven love is and only here . The rest is dreams .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>Could we awake from love and find Earth true ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>No , no , no . Sweet Lady , let not such fancies alarm you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>And yet folks wake from dreams . It would be terrible .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>No , no , there are things too real for dreams . You cannot waken from love . Dreams are of fantastic things , things fanciful and weak , and things confused and intricate like Earth . When you think of them in your dreams you see their unreality . But if love were not real what could there be to wake to .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>True . How wise you are . It was but a fancy that troubled me .<stage>Looking down .</stage>It was one of those dreams at dawn . It is faint and far-off now .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>Will you love me for ever , Golden Queen ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>For ever . Why not ? You will love me for ever ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>For ever . I cannot help it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>Let us look at the dream far off , in the dimness our thoughts have forsaken .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>Aye , let us look . It was a sad dream somewhat ; and yet upon this peak where all is love all that we see seems happy .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>See the dream there . Look at those . They seem to walk dreamily as they walk in the dream .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>It is because they have not love , which is only here .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>Look ! Look at those dreamers in the dream .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>They are running .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>Oh ! Look !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>They are pursued .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>The brown ones are pursuing them with spears .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>It is Prince Meliflor , Prince Moomoomon , Prince Ximenung that run in the dream . And the Prince of Huz . The brown men are close .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>The brown ones are overtaking them .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>Yes , they are closer .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>Look ! Prince Ximenung !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>Yes , he is dead in the dream .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>The Prince of Huz ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>Speared .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>Still , still they are killing them .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>It is all the Hundred Princes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>They are killing them all .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>A sad sight once .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>Once ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>I should have wept once .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>It is so far off now .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>It is so far , far off . We can only feel joy upon this holy mountain .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>Only joy .<stage>He sighs as he looks .</stage>Look !<stage>He sighs again .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>There falls the poor Prince Meliflor .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>How huge a thrust it was with the great spear .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>He is dead .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>Are you not happy ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>Yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>In your voice there seemed to sound some far-off thing . Some strange thing . Was it sorrow ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>No ; we are too high ; sorrow cannot come . No grief can touch us here , no woe drift up to us from the woes of Earth .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>I thought there was some strange thing in your voice , like sorrows we have dreamed .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>No , Golden Queen . Those fancied sorrows of dreams cannot touch reality .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>: You will never be sorry we have woken and left the dream of</l>
        <l>Earth ?</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>No , glorious lady ; nothing can bring me trouble ever again .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>Not even I ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>Never you , my Golden Zoomzoomarma , for on this sacred peak where there is only love you cannot .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>We will dwell here for ever in endless joy . ZOON<stage>looking down</stage>All dead now , all the Princes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>Turn , my Prince , from the dream of Earth , lest trouble come up from it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>It cannot drift up here ; yet we will turn from the dream .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>Let us think of endless joy upon the edge of heaven .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>Yes , Queen ; for ever in reality while all else dream away .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>It is the years that make them drowsy . They dream to dream the years away . Time cannot reach so high as here , the years are far below us .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>Far below us , making a dream and troubling it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>They do not know in the dream that only love is real .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>If time could reach us here we should pass , too . Nothing is real where time is .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>How shall we spend the calm that time does not vex , together here for ever ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>Holding your hand .<stage>She gives it .</stage>And kissing it often in the calm of eternity . Sometimes watching , a moment , the dream go by ; then kissing your hand again all in eternity .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>And never wearying ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>Not while eternity lingers here in heaven .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>Thus we will live until the dream goes by and Earth has faded under Aether Mountain .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>And then we shall watch the calm of Eternity .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>And you will still kiss my hand at times .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>Yes , while eternity wiles Heaven away .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>The silence is like music on Aether Mountain .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>It is because all is real . In the dream nothing was real . Music had to be made and then soon passed trembling away . Here all things always are as the desire of Earth , Earth 's desire that groped among fantasies finding them false .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>Let us forget the dream . ZOON<stage>kissing her hand</stage>I have forgotten for ever .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>Ah !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>What trouble has drifted up to you from Earth ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>An old saying .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>It was said in the dream .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>

       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>All is unreal but love , my crownéd Zoomzoomarma . Where there was not love it cannot have been true .</p>

      <stage>He tries to take her hand again .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>Touch not my hand . It was true .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>What was the saying heard in the dream of Earth that was true ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>None is worthy to touch my hand ; no , none .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>By Aether Mountain , I will kiss your hand again ! What is this saying out of a dream that dares deny reality ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>It is true ! Oh , it is true !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>Out of that hurried , aimless dream , that knows not its own end even , you have brought me a saying and say it against love .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>I say it is true !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZOON</speaker>
       <p>Nothing is true against love . Fate only is greater .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>Then it is Fate .</p>
      </sp>

       <p>Against Fate I will kiss your hand again .</p>

       <p>It is certain death .</p>

       <p>Oh , Zoomzoomarma , forget that troubled dream , and things said by dreamers , while I kiss your hand in heaven if only once again .</p>

      <p>O well , you know Mr. Jones ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>That good man !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>—— did say that dukes were no good , mother . They oppress the poor , I think he said .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Very true .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>Well , there you are .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Yes , yes , of course . At the same time , father had rather set his heart on it . You would n't have any other reason now , child , would you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>: What more do you want , mother ? Mr. Jones is a Cabinet</l>
       <l>Minister ; he must know what he 's talking about .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Yes , yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>And I hear he 's going to get a peerage .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. SLADDER</speaker>
      <p><stage>with enthusiasm</stage>Well , I 'm sure he deserves it . But child , you must n't talk to father to-day . You must n't stay here any longer .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>But why not , mother ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Well , child , he 's been smoking one of those big cigars again , and he 's absent-like . And he 's been talking a good deal with Mr. Splurge . It 's one of his great days , I think , Ermyntrude . I feel sure it is . One of those days that has given us all this money , and all these fine houses , with all those little birds that his gentlemen friends shoot . He has an idea !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>O , mother , do you really think so ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>I 'm sure of it , child .<stage>Looking out .</stage>There ! There he is ! Walking along that path that they made . I can see he 's got an idea . How like Napoleon .<stage>*</stage>He 's walking with Mr. Splurge . They 're coming in now . Come along , Ermyntrude , we must n't disturb him to-day . He has some great idea , some great idea .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Footnote *: ( N. B .— SLADDER is not in the very least like Napoleon .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>How splendid , mother ! What do you think it is ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Ah . I could never explain it to you , even if I knew . It is business , child , business . It is n't everybody that can understand business .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>I hear them coming , mother .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>There must be things we can never understand : things too deep for us like . And business is the most wonderful of them all .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Exeunt R .</stage>
     <stage>Enter SLADDER and SPLURGE through the window , which opens on to the lawn , down a step or two .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Now , Splurge , we must do some business .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>Yes , sir .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Sit down , Splurge .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>Thank you , sir .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Splurge , I am going to say to you now , what I could n't talk about with all those gardeners hanging about . And , by the way , Splurge , have n't we bought rather too many gardeners ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>No , sir . The Earl of Etheldune has seven ; we had to go one better than him , sir .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Certainly , Splurge , certainly .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>So I bought ten for you , sir , to be on the safe side .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Ah , quite right , Splurge , quite right . There seemed to be rather a lot , but that 's quite right . Well , now to business .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>Yes , sir .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>I told you I 'd invented a new name for a food .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>Yes , sir . Cheezo .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Well , what have you been able to do about it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>I 've had some nice little posters done , sir . I 'm having it well written up . I 've got some samples here , and it looks like doing very well indeed .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Ah !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>It 's a grand name , if I may say so , sir . It sounds so classical-like with that “ O ” at the end ; and yet anyone can see what it 's derived from , even if he 's never learnt anything . It suggests cheese to them every time .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Let 's see your samples .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>Well , sir , here 's one .<stage>Brings paper from pocket . Reads .</stage>“ What is Cheezo ? Go where you may , speak with whom you will , the same question confronts you . Cheezo is the great new —— ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>No , Splurge . Cut that question bit . We must have no admission on our part that there 's anyone who does n't know what Cheezo is . Cut it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>You 're quite right , sir ; you 're quite right . That 's a weak bit . I 'll cut it .<stage>He scratches it out . Reads .</stage>“ Cheezo is the great new food . It builds up body and brain . ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>That 's good .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>: “ There is a hundred times more lactic fluid in an ounce of</l>
       <l>Cheezo than in a gallon of milk . ”</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>What 's lactic fluid , Splurge ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>I do n't know , sir , but it 's good stuff all right . It 's the right thing to have in it . It 's a good man that I got to write this .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>All right . Go on .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>“ Cheezo makes darling baby grow . ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Good . Very good . Very good indeed , Splurge .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>Yes , I think that catches them , sir .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Go on .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>“ Cheezo . The only food . ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>“ The only food ” ? I do n't like that .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>It will go down all right , sir , so long as the posters are big enough .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Go down all right ! I was n't fool enough to suppose that it would n't go down all right . What are posters for if the public does n't believe them ? Of course it will go down all right .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>O , I beg your pardon , sir . Then what do n't you quite like about it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>I might invent another food one of these days , and then where should we be ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>I had n't thought of that , sir .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Out with it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Scratches with pencil</stage>“ Cheezo is made out of the purest milk from purest English cows . ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Y-e-s , y-e-s . I do n't say you 're wrong . I do n't say you 're exactly wrong . But in business , Splurge , you want to keep more to generalities . Talk about the bonds that bind the Empire , talk about the Union Jack , talk by all means about the purity of the English cow ; but definite statements you know , definite statements ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>O , yes , I know , sir ; but the police never interfere with anything one puts on a poster . It would be bad for business , a jury would never convict , and ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>I did n't say they would ; but if some interfering ass were to write to the papers to say that Cheezo was n't made from milk , we should have to go to the expense of buying a dozen cows , and photographing them , and one thing and another .<stage>He gets up and goes to cupboard .</stage>Now , look here . I quite understand what you say , purity and all that , and a very good point too , but you look at this .<stage>He unrolls a huge poster representing a dairymaid smirking in deadly earnest . On it is printed : “ WON'T YOU HAVE SOME ? ” and on another part of the poster “ CHEEZO FOR PURITY . ”</stage>You see . Your whole point 's there . We state nothing and we can make the dairymaid as suggestive as we like .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>Yes , sir , that is excellent . Quite splendid .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>They shall look at that on every road and railway , where it enters every town in England . I 'll have it on the cliffs of Dover . It shall be the first thing they see when they come back home , and the last thing for them to remember when they leave England . I 'll have it everywhere . I 'll rub their noses in it . And then , Splurge , they 'll ask for Cheezo when they want cheese , and that will mean I shall have the monopoly of all the cheese in the world .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>You 're a great man , sir .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>I 'll be a greater one , Splurge . I 'm not past work yet . What more have you got ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>I 've rather a nice little poster being done , sir . A boy and a girl looking at one another with a rather knowing look . There 's a large query mark all over the girl 's dress . Then over the top in big letters I 've put : “ What is the secret ? ” and in smaller letters : “ I 've got a bit of Cheezo . ” It makes people look at it , the children 's faces are so wicked .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Good , Splurge . Very good . I 'll have that one . I 'll rub their noses in that one .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>Then I 've got some things for the Press .<stage>Reads .</stage>“ She : ‘ Darling . ’ He : ‘ Yes , wifey . ’ She : ‘ You wo n't forget , darling . ’ He : ‘ No , wifey . ’ She : ‘ You wo n't forget to bring me some of that excellent Cheezo , so nutritious , so nice for darling baby , to be had at all grocers ; but be sure that you find the name of Sladder on their well-known pink wrappers . ’ He : ‘ Certainly , wifey . ’ ” Just the usual thing , sir , of course ; only I have a very good little picture to go with it , very suggestive indeed ; I 've made all the arrangements with the Press and the bill-posters , sir . I think we 'll make a big thing of it , sir .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Well , Splurge , nothing remains to be done now , except to make the Cheezo .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>How do you think of doing it , sir ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Do you know how they kill pigs in Chicago ? No , you 've not travelled yet . Well , they get their pigs on a slide , one man cuts their throats as fast as they go by , another shaves their bristles , and so on , and so on ; one man for each job , and all at it at once ; they do it very expeditiously . Well , there 's an interfering fellow sent there by the Government<stage>we would n't stand him in England</stage>, and if a pig has a sign of tuberculosis on him he wo n't let that pig go down . Now you 'd think that pig was wasted . He is n't . He goes into soap . Now , Splurge , how many cakes of soap were used in the world last year ? SPLURGE<stage>getting up</stage>Last year ? I do n't think we have the figures in for last year yet , sir .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He goes to bookshelf .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Well , the year before will do .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p><stage>taking book and turning pages</stage>The figures are given , I think , sir , from the 1st of March to the 1st of March .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>That will do .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>Ah , here it is , sir . Soap statistics for the twelve months ending 1st of March this year . A hundred and four million users , using on an average twenty cakes each per year . Then there are partial users , and occasional users . The total would be about twenty-one hundred million , sir .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Pure waste , Splurge , all pure waste .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>Waste , sir ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Pure waste . What do you suppose becomes of all that soap , all that good fat ? Proteids , I think they call ‘ em . And proteids are good for you , Splurge .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>What becomes of them , sir ? They 're used up .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>No , Splurge . They disappear , I grant you . They float away . But they 're still there Splurge , they 're still there . All that good fat is somewhere .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>But — but , sir — but — In the drains , sir ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>: All those million of cakes of soap . There must be tons of it ,</l>
       <l>Splurge . And we 'll get it .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>You are a wonderful man , sir .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>O , I 've a few brains , Splurge . That anyone might have . But I use mine , that 's all . There 's cleverer people than me in the world ——</p>

      <p>No , sir .</p>

      <p>O , yes , there are . Lots of them . But they 're damned fools . And why ? ‘ Cause they do n't use their brains . They mess about learning Greek . Greek ! Can you believe it ? What good does Greek ever do them ?... But the money 's not made yet , Splurge .</p>

      <p>What , father ?</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Anything , everything . Only go and give them the cheese .</p>

      <p>All right , father .</p>

     <stage>She moves to the door R ., she looks round , then goes out by the French window instead .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Why are you going that way , child ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>O — er — I thought it would be nice to go round over the lawn , father . I can get in by the drawing-room .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>O , very well . Be quick , dear .</p>

      <p>All right , father .</p>

     <stage>The magnet that has attracted ERMYNTRUDE to the lawn now appears in the form of MR. HIPPANTHIGH , passing the window on his way to the hall-door . SLADDER and SPLURGE do not see him , having their backs to the window . ERMYNTRUDE looks round now and then to be sure of this . They hold hands longer than is laid down as necessary in books upon etiquette under the head of visiting . She gives him a look of glad and hopeful interrogation but he shakes his head solemnly , and passes gravely on , as one whose errand is no cheerful duty . She looks after him , then goes her way .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Well , Splurge , we can only wait .<stage>With emphasis .</stage>If these mice eat it ——</p>

      <p>Yes , sir ?</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>The public will eat it .</p>

      <p>Any other business to-day ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>O , only the cook , sir . He 's complaining about the vegetables , sir . He says he 's never been anywhere before where they did n't buy them . We get them out of the kitchen garden here , and it seems he does n't understand it . Says he wo n't serve a greengrocer , sir .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>A kitchen garden is the wrong thing , is it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>He says so , sir .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>But there was one here when we came .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>O , only country people , sir . I suppose they did n't know any better .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Well , where do people grow vegetables , then ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p>I asked the cook that , sir , and he said they do n't grow them , they buy them .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>O , all right , then . Let him buy them , then . We must do the right thing .</p>

      <p>Alone , eh ? Alone ?<stage>Aside to SPLURGE .</stage>It 's usual , eh ?<stage>To HIPPANTHIGH .</stage>Alone , of course , yes . You 've come to call , have n't you .<stage>Exit SPLURGE .</stage>Can I offer you — er , er — calling 's not much in my line , you know — but what I mean is — will you have a bottle of champagne ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>Mr. Sladder , I 've come to speak with you because I believe it to be my duty to do so . I have hesitated to come , but when for particular reasons it became most painful to me to do so , then I knew that it was my clear duty , and I have come .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>O , yes , what they call a duty call . O , yes , quite so . Yes , exactly .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>Mr. Sladder , many of my parishioners are acquainted with the thing that you sell as bread .<stage>From the moment of HIPPANTHIGH 'S entry till now SLADDER , over-cheerful and anxious , has been struggling to do and say the right thing through all the complications of a visit ; but now that the note of Business has been sounded he suddenly knows where he is and becomes alert and stern , and all there .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>What ? Virilo ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>Yes . They pay more for it than they pay for bread , because they 've been taught somehow , poor fools , that “ they must have the best . ” They 've been made to believe that it makes them , what they call virile , poor fools , and they 're growing ill on it . Not so ill that I can prove anything , and the doctor dare n't help me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Are you aware , Mr. Hippanthigh , that if you said in public what you 're saying to me , you would go to prison for it , unless you can run to the very heavy fine — damages would be enormous .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>I know that , Mr. Sladder , and so I have come to you as the last hope for my people .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Are you aware , Mr. Hippanthigh , that you are making an attack upon business ? I do n't say that business is as pure as a surplice . But I do say that in business it is — as you may not understand — get on or go under ; and without my business , or the business of the next man , who is doing his best to beat me , what would happen to trade ? I do n't know what 's going to happen to England if you get rid of her trade , Mr. Hippanthigh .... Well ?... When we 're broke because we 've been doing business with surplices on , what are the other countries going to do , Mr. Hippanthigh ? Can you answer me that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>No , Mr. Sladder .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Ah ! So I 've got the best of you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>Yes , Mr. Sladder . I 'm not so clever as you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Glad you admit the point . As for cleverness it is n't that I 've so much of that , but I use what I 've got . Well , have you anything more to say ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>Only to appeal to you , Mr. Sladder , on behalf of these poor people .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Why . But you admitted one must have business , and that it can n't be run like a tea-party . What more do you want ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>I want you to spare them , Mr. Sladder .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Spare them ? Spare them ? Why , what 's the matter with them ? I 'm not killing them .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>No , Mr. Sladder , you 're not killing them . The mortality among children 's a bit on the high side , but I would n't say that was entirely due to your bread . There 's a good many minor ailments among the grown-up people , it seems to attack their digestion mostly , one can n't trace each case to its source ; but their health and their teeth are n't what they were when they had the pure wheaten bread .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>But there is wheat in my bread , prepared by a special process .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>Ah ! It 's that special process that does it , I expect .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Well , they need n't buy it if it is n't good .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>Ah , they can n't help themselves , poor fools ; they 've been taught to do it from their childhood up . Virilo , Bredo and Weeto , that are all so much better than bread , it 's a choice between these three . Bread is never advertised , or God 's good wheat .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Mr. Hippanthigh , if I 'm too much of a fool to sell my goods I suffer for it ; if they 're such fools as to buy my Virilo , they suffer for it — that is to say , you say they do — that is a natural law that may be new to you . But why should I suffer more than them ? Besides , if I take my Virilo off the market just to oblige you , Mr. Hippanthigh , a little matter of £ 30 , 000 a year ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>I — er ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>O , do n't mention it . Any little trifle to oblige ! But if I did , up would go the sales of Bredo and Weeto<stage>which have nothing to do with my firm</stage>, and your friends would n't be any better for that let me tell you , for I happen to know how they 're made .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>I am not speaking of the wickedness of others . I come to appeal to you , Mr. Sladder , that for nothing that you do , our English race shall lose anything of its ancient strength , in its young men in their prime , or that they should grow infirm a day sooner than God intended , when He planned his course for man . ERMYNTRUDE<stage>off</stage>Father ! Father !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>SLADDER draws himself up , and stands erect to meet the decisive news that he has expected .</stage>
     <stage>Enter ERMYNTRUDE .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>Father ! The mice have eaten the cheese .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>Ah ! The public will —— O !</l>
       <stage>He has suddenly seen HIPPANTHIGH</stage>
       <l>HIPPANTHIGH</l>
       <stage>solemnly</stage>
       <l>What new wickedness is this , Mr. Sladder ?</l>
       <stage>All stand silent .</stage>
       <l>Good-bye , Mr. Sladder .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <stage>He goes to the door , passing ERMYNTRUDE . He looks at her and sighs as he goes . He passes MRS. SLADDER near the door , and bows in silence .</stage>
     <stage>Exit .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>What have you been saying to Mr. Hippanthigh , father ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Saying ! He 's been doing all the saying . He does n't let you do much saying , does Hippanthigh .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>But , father . What did he come to see you about ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>He came to call your poor old father all kinds of bad names , he did . It seems your old father is a wicked fellow , Ermyntrude .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>O , father , I 'm sure he never meant it .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>HIPPANTHIGH goes by the window with a mournful face . ERMYNTRUDE runs to the window and watches him till he is out of sight . She quietly waves her hand to HIPPANTHIGH , unseen by her father .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>O , he meant it all right . He meant it . I 'm sorry for that bishop of his that he quarrels with , if he lets him have it the way he went for your poor old father . O , dear me ; dear me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>I do n't think he quarrels with him , father . I think he only insists that there can be no such thing as eternal punishment . I think that 's rather nice of him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>I do n't care a damn about eternal punishment one way or the other . But a man who quarrels with the head of his firm 's a fool . If his bishop 's keen on hell , he should push hell for all it 's worth .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>Y-e-s , I suppose he should . But , father , are n't you glad that my mice have eaten the new cheese ? I thought you 'd be glad , father .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>So I am , child . So I am . Only I do n't feel quite so glad as I thought I was going to , now . I do n't know why . He seems to have stroked me the wrong way somehow .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>You said you 'd give me whatever I liked .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>And so I will , child . So I will . A motor if you like , with chauffeur and footman complete . We can buy anything now , and I would n't grudge ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>I do n't want a motor , father .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>What would you like to have ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>O , nothing , father , nothing . Only about that duke , father ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>What duke , Ermyntrude ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>Mother said you wanted me to marry a duke some day , father .</p>

      <p>Well ?</p>

      <p>O , I guessed he was 82 , going to be 83 next birthday . But I daresay I know nothing of the world . I daresay I may have been wrong .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>We 'll see Mr. Hippanthigh .<stage>Enter SPLURGE .</stage>Splurge , run after Mr. Hippanthigh and bring him back . Say I 've got something to say to him . He 's gone that way . Quick !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SPLURGE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Exit .</stage>Yes , sir .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>I 've got something to say to him this time .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>Father ! What are you going to do ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>I 'm going to give him What For .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>But why , father ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Because he 's been giving it to your poor old father .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>Father ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Well ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>Be kind to him , father .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>O , I 'll be kind to him . I 'll be kind to him . Just you wait . I 'll be kind to him !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>But you would n't send him away , father . Father , for my sake you would n't do that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>O , we have n't come to that yet .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>But , but — you 've sent for him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>O , I 've sent for him to give him What For . We 'll come to the rest later .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>But , when you do come to it , father .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Why , when we do come to it , if the young man 's any good , I 'll not stand in my daughter 's way ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>O , thank you , father .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>And if he 's no good<stage>firmly</stage>I 'll protect my child from him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>But , father , I do n't want to be protected .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>If a man 's a man , he must be some good at something . Well , this man 's chosen the clergyman job . I 've nothing against the job , it 's well enough paid at the top , but is this young man ever going to get there ? Is he ever going to get off the bottom rung ? How long has he been a curate ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>Eight years , father .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>It 's a long time .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>But , father , he would get a vicarage if it was n't for the bishop . The bishop stands in his way . It is n't nice of him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>If I 'd quarrelled with the head of my firm when I was his age , you would n't be getting proposals from a curate ; no such luck . The dustman would have been more in your line .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>But , father , he does n't quarrel with the bishop . His conscience does n't let him believe in eternal punishment , and so he speaks straight out . I do admire him so for it . He knows that if he was silent he 'd have had a good living long ago .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>The wife of the head of my firm believed in spirit rapping . Did I go and tell her what an old fool she was ? No , I brought her messages from another world as regular as a postman .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Steps are heard outside the window .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Run along , my dear , now .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>Very well , father .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>The man that 's going to look after my daughter must be able to look after himself . Otherwise I will , till a better man comes .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Exit ERMYNTRUDE . HIPPANTHIGH and SPLURGE appear at the window . HIPPANTHIGH enters and SPLURGE moves away .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>You sent for me , Mr. Sladder ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Y-e-s — y-e-s. Take a chair . Now , Mr. Hippanthigh , I have n't often been told off the way you told me off .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>I felt it to be my duty , Mr. Sladder .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Yes , quite so . Exactly . Well , it seems I 'm a thoroughly bad old man , only fit to rob the poor , an out-and-out old ruffian .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>I never said that .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>No . But you made me feel it . I never felt so bad about myself before , not as bad as that . But you , Mr. Hippanthigh , you were the high-falutin ’ angel with a new brass halo , out on its bank holiday . Now , how would clandestine love-making strike you , Mr. Hippanthigh ? Would that be all right to your way of thinking ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>Clandestine , Mr. Sladder ? I hardly understand you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>I understand that you have been making love to my daughter .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>I admit it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Well , I have n't heard you say anything about it to me before . Did you tell her mother ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>Er — no .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Perhaps you told me . Very likely I 've forgotten it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>No .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Well , who did you tell ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>We — we had n't told anyone yet .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Well , I think clandestine 's the word for it , Mr. Hippanthigh . I have n't had time in my life to bother about the exact<stage>1</stage>meanings of words or any nonsense of that sort , but I think clandestine 's about the word for it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>It 's a hard word , Mr. Sladder .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>May be . And who began using hard words ? You came here and made me out a pickpocket , just because I use a few tasty little posters which sell my goods , and all the while you 're trying on the sly to take a poor old man 's daughter away from him . Well , Mr. Hippanthigh ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>I — I never looked at it in that light before , Mr. Sladder . I never thought of it in that way . You have made me feel ashamed<stage>he lowers his head</stage>, ashamed .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Aha ! Aha ! I thought I would . Now you know what it 's like when you make people ashamed of themselves . You do n't like it when they do it to you . Aha !<stage>SLADDER is immensely pleased with himself .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>Mr. Sladder , I spoke to you as my conscience demanded , and you have shown me that I have done wrong in not speaking sooner about our engagement . I would have spoken to you , but I could not say that and the other thing in the same day . I meant to tell you soon ;— well , I did n't , and I know it looks bad . I 've done wrong and I admit it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Aha !<stage>Still hugely pleased .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>But , Mr. Sladder , you would not on that account perhaps spoil your daughter 's happiness , and take a terrible revenge on me . You would not withhold your consent to our ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Wait a moment ; we 're coming to that . There 's some bad animal that I 've heard of that lives in France , and when folks attack it it defends itself . I 've just been defending myself . I think I 've shown you that you 're no brand-new extra-gilt angel on the top of a spire .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>O — I — er — never ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Quite so . Well , now we come on to the other part . Very well . Those lords and people , they marry one another 's daughters , because they know they 're all no good . They 're afraid it will get out like , and spread some of their damned mediæval ideas where they 'll do harm . So they keep it in the family like . But we people who have had the sense to look after ourselves , we do n't throw our daughters away to any young man that can n't look after himself . See ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>I assure you , Mr. Sladder , I should — er ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>She 's my only daughter , and if any of my grandchildren are going to the work-house , they 'll go to one where the master 's salary is high , and they 'll go there as master .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>I am aware , Mr. Sladder , that I have very little money ; as you would look at it , very little .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>It is n't the amount of money you 've got as matters . The question is this : are you a young man as money is any good to ? If I died and left you a million , would you know what to do with it ? I 've met men what would n't last more than six weeks on a million . Then they 'd starve if nobody gave them another million . I 'm not going to give my daughter to one of that sort .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>I was third in the classical tripos at Cambridge , Mr. Sladder .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>I do n't give a damn for classics ; and I do n't give a damn for Cambridge ; and I do n't know what a tripos is . But all I can tell you is that if I was fool enough to waste my time with classics , third would n't<stage>2</stage>be good enough for me . No , Mr. Hippanthigh , you 've chosen the church as your job , and I 've nothing to say against your choice ; its a free country , and I 've nothing to say against your job ; it 's well enough paid at the top , only you do n't look like getting there . I chose business as my job , there seemed more sense in it ; but if I 'd chosen the Church , I should n't have stuck as a curate . No , nor a bishop either . I would n't have had an archbishop ballyragging me and ordering me about . No . I 'd have got to the top , and drawn big pay , and spent it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>But , Mr. Sladder , I could be a vicar to-morrow if my conscience would allow me to cease protesting against a certain point which the bishop holds to be ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>I know all about that . I do n't care what it is that keeps you on the bottom rung of the ladder . Conscience , you say . Well , it 's a different thing with every man . It 's conscience with some , drink with others , sheer stupidity with most . It 's pretty crowded already , that bottom rung , without me going and putting my daughter on it . Where do you suppose I 'd be now if I 'd let my conscience get in my way ? Eh ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>Mr. Sladder , I cannot alter my beliefs .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Nobody asks you to . I only ask you to leave the bishop alone . He says one thing and you preach another whenever you get half a chance ; it 's enough to break up any firm .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>Believing as I do that eternal punishment is incompatible with ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Now , Mr. Hippanthigh , that 's got to stop . I do n't mind saying , now that I 've given you What For , that you do n't seem a bad young fellow : but my daughter 's not going to marry on the bottom rung , and there 's an end of that .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>But , Mr. Sladder , can you bring yourself to believe in anything so terrible as eternal punishment , so contrary to ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Me ? No .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>Then , how can you ask me to ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>That particular belief never happened to stand between me and the top of the tree . Many things did , but they 're all down below me now , Mr. Hippanthigh , way down there<stage>pointing</stage>where I can hardly see them . You get off that bottom rung as I did years ago .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>I cannot go back on all I 've said .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>I do n't want to make it hard for you . Only just say you believe in eternal punishment , and then give up talking about it . You may say it to me if you like . We 'll have one other person present so that there 's no going back on it , my daughter if you like . I 'll let the bishop know , and he wo n't stand in your way any longer , but at present you force his hand . It 's you or the rules of the firm .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>I cannot .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>You can n't just say to me and my daughter that you believe in eternal punishment , and leave me to go over to Axminster and put it right with the bishop ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>I cannot say what I do not believe .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Think . The bishop probably does n't believe it himself . But you 've been forcing his hand ,— going out of your way to .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>I cannot say it . SLADDER<stage>rising</stage>Mr. Hippanthigh , there 's two kinds of men , those that succeed , those that do n't . I know no other kind . You ...</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>I cannot go against my conscience .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>I do n't care what your reason is . You are the second kind . I am sorry my daughter ever loved a man of that sort . I am sorry a man of that sort ever entered my house . I was a little , dirty , ragged boy . You make me see what I would be to-day if I had been a man of your kind . I would be dirty and ragged still .<stage>His voice has been rising during this speech .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Enter ERMYNTRUDE .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>Father ! What are you saying , father ? I heard such loud voices .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>HIPPANTHIGH stands silent and mournful .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>My child , I had foolish ideas for you once , but now I say that you are to marry a man , not a wretched , miserable little curate , who will be a wretched , miserable little curate all his life .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>Father , I will not hear such words .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>I 've given him every chance . I 've given him more than every chance , but he prefers the bottom rung of the ladder ; there we will leave him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERMYNTRUDE</speaker>
      <p>O , father ! How can you be so cruel ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>It 's not my fault , and it 's not the bishop 's fault . It 's his own silly pig-headedness .<stage>He goes back to his chair .</stage>ERMYNTRUDE<stage>going up to HIPPANTHIGH</stage>O , Charlie , could n't you do what father wants ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HIPPANTHIGH</speaker>
      <p>No , no , I cannot . He wants me to go back on things I 've said .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Enter MRS. SLADDER carrying a wire cage , with two dead white mice in it . Also SPLURGE .</stage>

       <l>Ermyntrude 's poor mice ! And father 's great idea ! Whatever shall we do ?</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Er ?<stage>Almost a groan</stage>Eh ? Died have they ?<stage>SLADDER ages in his chair . You would say he was beaten . Suddenly he tautens up his muscles and stands up straight with shoulders back and clenched hands .</stage>So they would beat Sladder , would they ? They would beat Sladder . No , that has yet to be done . We 'll go on , Splurge . The public shall eat Cheezo . It 's a bit strong perhaps . We 'll tone it down with bad nuts that they use for the other cheeses . We 'll advertise it , and they 'll eat it . See to it , Splurge . They do n't beat Sladder .</p>

       <l>HIPPANTHIGH</l>
       <stage>suddenly with clear emphasis</stage>

      <speaker>MRS. SLADDER</speaker>
      <p>Why , Ermyntrude ! Well , I never ! And to think of all this happening in one day !</p>

      <head>SCENE</head>
      <stage>A Crypt of a Monastery . BROTHER GREGORIUS PEDRO is seated on a stone bench reading . Behind him is a window .</stage>
      <stage>Enter BROTHER LUCULLUS SEVERUS .</stage>
     </stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>Brother , we may doubt no longer .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>Well ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>It is certain . Certain .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>I too had thought so .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>It is clear now , clear as ... It is certain .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>Well , why not ? After all , why not ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>You mean ...?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>‘ Tis but a miracle .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>Yes , but ...</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>But you did not think to see one ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>No , no , not that ; but Brother Antoninus ...</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>Well , why not he ? He is holy as any , fasts as often as any , wears coarser clothing than most of us , and once scourged a woman because she looked at our youngest — scourged her right willingly .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>Yet , Brother Antoninus !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>Yet , why not ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>We knew him , somehow . One does not know the blessed saints of heaven .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>No , no indeed . I never thought to see such a thing on earth ; and now , now ... you say it is certain ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>Certain .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>Ah , well . It seemed like it , it seemed like it for some days . At first I thought I had looked too long through our eastern window , I thought it was the sun that had dazzled my eyes ; and then , then it was clearly something else .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>It is certain now .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>Ah , well . LUCULLUS SEVERUS<stage>sitting beside him , sighs</stage>I grudge him nothing . GREGORIUS PEDRO<stage>a little heavily</stage>No , nor I .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>You are sad , brother .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>No , not sad .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>Ah , but I see it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>Ah , well .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>What grieves you , brother ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p><stage>Sighs</stage>We shall water the roses no more , he and I . We shall roll the lawns no more . We shall tend the young tulips together never again .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>Oh , why not ? Why not ? There is not all that difference .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>There is .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>It is our cross , brother . We must bear it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>Ah , yes . Yes , yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>A bell rings noisily .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>The gate bell , brother ! Be of good cheer , it is the gate bell ringing !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>Why should I be of good cheer because the gate bell rings ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>Why , brother , the world is at the gate . We shall see someone . It is an event . Someone will come and speak of the great world . Oh , be of good cheer , be of good cheer , brother .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>I think that I am heavy at heart to-day .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Enter JOHN SMOGGS .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SMOGGS</speaker>
      <p>Ullo , Governor . Is either o ’ yer the chief monk ?</p>

      <p>We do not understand your angry zeal .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>What does he say , brother ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>Friend , you perplex us . We hoped you would speak to us of the great world , its gauds , its wickedness , its ——</p>

     </sp>
     <stage>He turns and runs . Exit .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>It 's Antoninus !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>Why , yes ; yes , of course !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>He must have seen him over the garden wall .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>We must hush it up .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>Hush it up ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>There must be no scandal in the monastery .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Enter BROTHER ANTONINUS wearing a halo . He walks across and exits .</stage>
     <stage>GREGORIUS is gazing with wide eyes .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>There must be no scandal in the monastery .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>It has grown indeed !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>Yes , it has grown since yesterday .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>I noticed it dimly just three days ago . I noticed it dimly . But I did not —— I could not guess ... I never dreamed that it would come to this .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>Yes , it has grown for three days .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>It was just a dim light over his head , but now ...!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>It flamed up last night .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>There is no mistaking it now .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>There must be no scandal .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>No scandal , brother ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>Look how unusual it is . People will talk . You heard what that man said . They will all talk . GREGORIUS PEDRO<stage>sadly</stage>Ah , well .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>How could we face it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>It is , yes , yes ,— it is unusual .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>Nothing like it has happened for many centuries . GREGORIUS PEDRO<stage>sadly</stage>No , no . I suppose not . Poor Antoninus .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>Why could he not have waited ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>Waited ? What ? Three — three hundred years ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>Or even five or ten . He is long past sixty .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>Yes , yes , it would have been better .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>You saw how ashamed he was .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>Poor Antoninus . Yes , yes . Brother , I think if we had not been here he would have come and sat on this bench .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>I think he would . But he was ashamed to come , looking , looking like that .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>Brother , let us go . It is the hour at which he loves to come and sit here , and read in the Little Book of Lesser Devices . Let us go so that he may come here and be alone .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LUCULLUS SEVERUS</speaker>
      <p>As you will , brother ; we must help him when we can .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>They rise and go .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GREGORIUS PEDRO</speaker>
      <p>Poor Antoninus . LUCULLUS SEVERUS<stage>glancing</stage>I think he will come back now .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Exeunt . The bare , sandaled foot of ANTONINUS appears as the last heel lifts in the other doorway .</stage>
     <stage>Enter ANTONINUS rather timidly . He goes to bench and sits . He sighs . He shakes his head to loosen the halo , but in vain . He sighs . Then he opens his book and reads in silence . Silence gives way to mumbles , mumbles to words . [ 4</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANTONINUS</speaker>
      <p>and finally beat down Satan under our feet .<stage>Enter SATAN . He has the horns and long hair and beard of a he-goat . His face and voice are such as could have been once in heaven .</stage>ANTONINUS<stage>standing , lifting arm</stage>In the name of ...</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
      <p>Banish me not .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>ANTONINUS</speaker>
      <p>In the name ...</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
      <p>Say nothing you may regret , until I have spoken .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANTONINUS</speaker>
      <p>In the ...</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
      <p>Hear me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANTONINUS</speaker>
      <p>Well ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
      <p>There fell with me from heaven a rare , rare spirit , the light of whose limbs far outshone dawn and evening .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANTONINUS</speaker>
      <p>Well ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
      <p>We dwell in darkness .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANTONINUS</speaker>
      <p>What is that to me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
      <p>For that rare spirit I would have the gaud you wear , that emblem , that bright ornament . In return I offer you ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANTONINUS</speaker>
      <p>Begone ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
      <p>I offer you ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANTONINUS</speaker>
      <p>Begone .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
      <p>I offer you — Youth .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANTONINUS</speaker>
      <p>I will not traffic with you in damnation .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
      <p>I do not ask your soul , only that shining gaud .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANTONINUS</speaker>
      <p>Such things are not for hell .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
      <p>I offer you Youth .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANTONINUS</speaker>
      <p>I do not need it . Life is a penance and ordained as a tribulation . I have come through by striving . Why should I care to strive again ? SATAN<stage>smiles</stage>Why ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANTONINUS</speaker>
      <p>Why should I ? SATAN<stage>laughs , looking through window</stage>It 's spring , brother , is it not ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANTONINUS</speaker>
      <p>A time for meditation . SATAN<stage>laughs</stage>There are girls coming over the hills , brother . Through the green leaves and the May .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>ANTONINUS draws his scourge from his robe .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANTONINUS</speaker>
      <p>Up ! Let me scourge them from our holy place .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
      <p>Wait , brother , they are far off yet . But you would not scourge them , you would not scourge them , they are so ... Ah ! one has torn her dress !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANTONINUS</speaker>
      <p>Ah , let me scourge her !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
      <p>No , no , brother . See , I can see her ankle through the rent . You would not scourge her . Your great scourge would break that little ankle .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANTONINUS</speaker>
      <p>I will have my scourge ready , if she comes near our holy place .</p>

      <speaker>ANTONINUS</speaker>
      <p>Speak not of such things . Speak not , I say .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>SATAN is leaning leisurely against the wall , smiling through the window .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
      <p>How the leaves are shining . Now she is seated on the grass . They have gathered small flowers , Antoninus , and put them in her hair , a row of primroses . ANTONINUS<stage>his eyes go for a moment on to far , far places . Unintentionally</stage>What colour ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
      <p>Black .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANTONINUS</speaker>
      <p>No , no , no ! I did not mean her hair . No , no . I meant the flowers .</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
      <p>Yellow , Antoninus . ANTONINUS<stage>flurried</stage>Ah , of course , yes , yes .</p>

      <p>You — you cannot .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
      <p>All things are possible unto me except salvation .</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>ANTONINUS</speaker>
      <p>How ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
      <p>Give me your gaud . Then meet me at any hour between star-shining and cock-crow under the big cherry tree , when the moon is waning .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANTONINUS</speaker>
      <p>Never .</p>

       <l>: Ah , Spring , Spring . They are dancing . Such nimble ankles .</l>
<stage>ANTONINUS raises his scourge .</stage>       <l>SATAN</l>
       <stage>more gravely</stage>
       <l>: Think , Antoninus , forty or fifty more Springs .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>

      <p>Never , never , never .</p>

      <speaker>ANTONINUS</speaker>
      <p>Never ! I will not look .</p>

      <p>Never ! My scourge is for such .<stage>SATAN sighs . The girls laugh from the hill . ANTONINUS hears the laughter .</stage>A look of fear comes over him .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>ANTONINUS</speaker>
      <p>Which ...<stage>a little peal of girlish laughter off</stage>Which cherry tree did you speak of ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
      <p>This one over the window . ANTONINUS<stage>with an effort</stage>It shall be held accursed . I will warn the brethren . It shall be cut down and hewn asunder and they shall burn it utterly . SATAN<stage>rather sorrowfully</stage>Ah , Antoninus .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANTONINUS</speaker>
      <p>You shall not tempt a monk of our blessed order .</p>

      <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
      <p>They are coming this way , Antoninus .</p>

      <p>Have your scourge ready , Antoninus .</p>

      <p>Perhaps , perhaps they have not merited extreme chastisement .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
      <p>They have made a garland of may , a long white garland drooped from their little hands . Ah , if you were young , Antoninus .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANTONINUS</speaker>
      <p>Tempt me not , Satan . I say , tempt me not !<stage>The girls sing , SATAN smiles , the girls sing on . ANTONINUS tip-toes to seat , back to window , and sits listening . The girls sing on . They pass the window and shake the branch of a cherry tree . The petals fall in sheets past the window . The girls sing on and ANTONINUS sits listening .</stage>ANTONINUS<stage>hand to forehead</stage>My head aches . I think it is that song .... Perhaps , perhaps it is the halo . Too heavy , too heavy for us .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>SATAN walks gently up and removes it and walks away with the gold disc . ANTONINUS sits silent .</stage>

      <p>When the moon is waning .</p>

      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>Oh , I do n't know , he was seventy only the other day . I do n't call that too old — nowadays . He can n't be now , he can n't be more than , let me see , seventy-eight . Where does this Mr. Shaker live ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NEEKS</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>: Shakespeare . Somewhere down in Warwickshire . A village called</l>
       <l>Bradford , I think , is the address he gives in the Candidates ’ Book .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>Warwickshire ! I do seem to remember something about him now . If he 's the same man I certainly do . William Shakespeare , you said .</p>

      <p>Poaches !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>Yes , a poacher . Trundleben deserves to get the sack for this . A poacher from the wilds of Warwickshire . I heard all about him . He got after the deer at Charlecote .</p>

      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>Well then , what does Mr. Newton do but go and second him , and there you are , Sir Webley .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>Yes , a pretty state of things . Has he ... Does he ... What is he ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>He seems to write , Sir Webley .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>Oh , he does , does he ? What does he write ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>Well , I wrote and asked him that , Sir Webley , and he said plays .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>Plays ? Plays ? Plays ? I 'm sure I never heard ... What plays ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>I asked him that , Sir Webley , and he said ... he sent me a list<stage>fumbling</stage>Ah , here it is .<stage>He holds it high , far from his face , tilts his head back and looks down his nose through his glasses .</stage>He says — let me see — “ Hamelt , ” or “ Hamlet , ” I do n't know how he pronounces it . “ Hamelt , Hamlet ” ; he spells it “ H-a-m-l-e-t . ” If you pronounce it the way one pronounces handle , it would be “ Hamelt , ” but if ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>What 's it all about ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>Well , I gathered the scene was in Denmark .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NEEKS</speaker>
      <p>Denmark ! H 'm ! another of those neutrals !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>Well , I would n't so much mind where the scene of the play was put , if only it was a play one ever had heard of .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NEEKS</speaker>
      <p>But those men who have much to do with neutrals are rather the men — do n't you think , Sir Webley ?— who ...</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>Who want watching . I believe you 're right , Neeks . And that type of unsuccessful play-wright is just the kind of man I always rather ...</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NEEKS</speaker>
      <p>That 's rather what I feel , Sir Webley .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>It would n't be a bad plan if we told somebody about him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NEEKS</speaker>
      <p>I think I know just the man , Sir Webley . I 'll just drop him a line .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>Yes , and if he 's all right there 's no harm done , but I always suspect that kind of fellow . Well , what else , Trundleben ? This is getting interesting .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>Well , Sir Webley , it 's really very funny , but he sent me a list of the characters in this play of his , “ Hamelt , ” and , and it 's really rather delicious ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NEEKS</speaker>
      <p>Yes ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>Yes ? What is it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>He 's got a ghost in his play .<stage>He-he-he-he-he</stage>A ghost ! He really has .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>What ! Not on the stage ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>Yes , on the stage !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NEEKS</speaker>
      <p>Well , well , well .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>But that 's absurd .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>I met Mr. Vass the other day — it was his four hundredth presentation of “ The Nighty ” — and I told him about it . He said that bringing a ghost on the stage was , of course — er — ludicrous .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>What else does he say he 's done ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>Er — er — there 's an absurdly long list — er — “ Macbeth . ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>“ Macbeth . ” That 's Irish .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NEEKS</speaker>
      <p>Ah , yes . Abbey Theatre style of thing .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>I think I heard he offered it them . But of course ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>No , quite so .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>I gathered it was all rather a — rather a sordid story . SIR WEBLEY<stage>solemnly</stage>Ah !<stage>NEEKS [ 5</stage>with equal solemnity wags his head . TRUNDLEBEN<stage>focussing his list again</stage>Here 's a very funny one . This is funnier than “ Hamlet . ” “ The Tempest . ” And the stage directions are “ The sea , with a ship . ” SIR WEBLEY<stage>laughs</stage>Oh , that 's lovely ! That 's really too good . The sea with a ship ! And what 's it all about ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>Well , I rather gathered that it was about a magician , and he — he makes a storm .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>He makes a storm . Splendid ! On the stage , I suppose .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>Oh yes , on the stage .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>SIR WEBLEY and NEEKS<span type="note_anchor">[ 6 ]</span>laugh heartily .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NEEKS</speaker>
      <p>He 'd ... He 'd have to be a magician for that , would n't he ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>: Ha , ha ! Very good ! He 'd have to be a magician to do that ,</l>
       <l>Trundleben .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>Yes , indeed , Sir Webley ; indeed he would , Mr. Neeks .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>But that stage direction is priceless . I 'd really like to copy that down if you 'd let me . What is it ? “ The sea with a ship ” ? It 's the funniest bit of the lot .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>: Yes , that 's it , Sir Webley . Wait a moment , I have it here .</l>
       <l>The — the whole thing is “ the sea with a ship , afterwards an island . ”</l>
       <l>Very funny indeed .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>“ Afterwards an island ” ! That 's very good , too . “ Afterwards an island . ” I 'll put that down also .<stage>He writes .</stage>And what else , Trundleben ? What else ?</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>TRUNDLEBEN holds out his list again .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>“ The Tragedy of — of King Richard the — the Second . ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>But was his life a tragedy ? Was it a tragedy , Neeks ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NEEKS</speaker>
      <p>I — I — well I 'm not quite sure ; I really do n't think so . But I 'll look it up .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>Yes , we can look it up .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>I think it was rather — perhaps rather tragic , Sir Webley .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>Oh , I do n't say it was n't . No doubt . No doubt at all . That 's one thing . But to call his whole life a tragedy is — is quite another . What , Neeks ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NEEKS</speaker>
      <p>Oh , quite another .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>Oh , certainly , Sir Webley . Tragedy is — er — is a very strong term indeed , to — to apply to such a case .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>He was probably out poaching when he should have been learning his history .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>I 'm afraid so , Sir Webley .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>And what else , eh ? Anything more ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>Well , there are some poems , he says .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Holds up a list .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>And what are they about ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>Well , there 's one called ... Oh . I 'd really rather not mention that one ; perhaps that had better be left out altogether .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NEEKS</speaker>
      <p>Not ...?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>Not quite ...?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>No , not at all . SIR WEBLEY and NEEKS : H 'm .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>: Left out altogether . And then there are “ Sonnets , ” and — and</l>
       <l>“ Venus and Adonis , ” and — and “ The Phœnix and the Turtle . ”</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>The Phœnix and the what ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>The Turtle .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>Oh . Go on ...</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>: One called “ The Passionate Pilgrim , ” another “ A Lover 's</l>
       <l>Complaint . ”</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>I think the whole thing 's very regrettable .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NEEKS</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>: I think so too , Sir Webley .</l>
       <l>TRUNDLEBEN</l>
       <stage>mournfully</stage>
       <l>: And there 've been no poets since poor</l>
       <l>Browning died , none at all . It 's absurd for him to call himself a poet .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NEEKS</speaker>
      <p>Quite so , Trundleben , quite so .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>And all these plays . What does he mean by calling them plays ? They 've never been acted .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>Well — er — no , not exactly acted , Sir Webley .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>What do you mean by not exactly , Trundleben ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>Well , I believe they were acted in America , though of course not in London .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>In America ? What 's that got to do with it . America ? Why , that 's the other side of the Atlantic .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>Oh , yes , Sir Webley , I — I quite agree with you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>America ! I daresay they did . I daresay they did act them . But that does n't make him a suitable member for the Olympus . Quite the contrary .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NEEKS</speaker>
      <p>Oh , quite the contrary .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>Oh , certainly , Sir Webley , certainly .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>I daresay “ Macbeth ” would be the sort of thing that would appeal to Irish Americans . Just the sort of thing .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>Very likely , Sir Webley , I 'm sure .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>Their game laws are very lax , I believe , over there ; they probably took to him on account of his being a poacher .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>I 've no doubt of it , Sir Webley . Very likely .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NEEKS</speaker>
      <p>I expect that was just it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>Well now , Trundleben ; are we to ask the Olympus to elect a man who 'll come in here with his pockets bulging with rabbits .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NEEKS</speaker>
      <p>Rabbits , and hares too .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>And venison even , if you come to that .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>Yes indeed , Sir Webley .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>Thank God the Olympus can get its haunch of venison without having to go to a man like that for it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NEEKS</speaker>
      <p>Yes indeed .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>Indeed I hope so .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>Well now , about those plays . I do n't say we 've absolute proof that the man 's entirely hopeless . We must be sure of our ground .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NEEKS</speaker>
      <p>Yes , quite so .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>Oh , I 'm afraid Sir Webley , they 're very bad indeed . There are some quite unfortunate — er — references in them .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>So I should have supposed . So I should have supposed .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NEEKS</speaker>
      <p>Yes , yes , of course .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>For instance , in that play about that funny ship — I have a list of the characters here — and I 'm afraid , well — er ,— er you see for yourself .<stage>Hands paper .</stage>You see that is , I am afraid , in very bad taste , Sir Webley .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>Certainly , Trundleben , certainly . Very bad indeed . NEEKS<stage>peering</stage>Er — er , what is it , Sir Webley ? SIR WEBLEY<stage>pointing</stage>That , you see .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NEEKS</speaker>
      <p>A — a drunken butler ! But most regrettable .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>A very deserving class . A — a quite gratuitous slight . I do n't say you might n't see one drunken butler ...</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>Quite so .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NEEKS</speaker>
      <p>Yes , of course .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>But to put it boldly on a programme like that is practically tantamount to implying that all butlers are drunken .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>Which is by no means true .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>There would naturally be a protest of some sort , and to have a member of the Olympus mixed up with a controversy like that would be — er — naturally — er — most ...</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>Yes , of course , Sir Webley .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>And then of course , if he does a thing like that once ...</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NEEKS</speaker>
      <p>There are probably other lapses just as deplorable .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>I have n't gone through his whole list , Sir Webley . I often feel about these modern writers that perhaps the less one looks the less one will find that might be , er ...</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>Yes , quite so .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NEEKS</speaker>
      <p>That is certainly true .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>Well , we can n't wade all through his list of characters to see if they are all suitable to be represented on a stage .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>Oh no , Sir Webley , quite impossible ; there are — there are — I might say — hundreds of them .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>Good gracious ! He must have been wasting his time a great deal .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>Oh , a great deal , Sir Webley .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>But we shall have to go further into this . We can n't have ...</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NEEKS</speaker>
      <p>I see Mr. Gleek sitting over there , Sir Webley .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>Why , yes , yes , so he is .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NEEKS</speaker>
      <p>The Banner and Evening Gazette would know all about him if there 's anything to know .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>Yes , of course they would .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NEEKS</speaker>
      <p>If we were to ask him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>Well , Trundleben , you may leave it to us . Mr. Neeks and I will talk it all over and see what 's to be done .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>Thank you , Sir Webley . I 'm really very sorry it all happened — very sorry indeed .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>Very well , Trundleben , we 'll see what 's to be done . If nothing 's known of him and his plays , you 'll have to write and request him to withdraw his candidature . But we 'll see . We 'll see .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TRUNDLEBEN</speaker>
      <p>Thank you , Sir Webley . I 'm sure I 'm very sorry it all occurred . Thank you , Mr. Neeks .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Exit TRUNDLEBEN , waddling slowly away .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR WEBLEY</speaker>
      <p>Well , Neeks , that 's what it will have to be . If nothing whatever 's known of him we can n't have him putting up for the Olympus .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NEEKS</speaker>
      <p>Quite so , Sir Webley . I 'll call Mr. Gleek 's attention .</p>

      <p>I say — why do n't you chuck it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>Oh , I do n't know . Some people seem to like my stuff , rather . That 's why I go on .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>I 'd chuck it if there 's no money in it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>Ah , but then it 's hardly in your line , is it ? You 'd hardly approve of poetry if there was money in it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>Oh , I do n't say that . If I could make as much by poetry as I can by betting I do n't say I would n't try the poetry touch , only ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>Only what ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>Oh , I do n't know . Only there seems more sense in betting , somehow .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>Well , yes . I suppose it 's easier to tell what an earthly horse is going to do , than to tell what Pegasus ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>What 's Pegasus ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>Oh , the winged horse of poets .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>I say ! You do n't believe in a winged horse , do you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>In our trade we believe in all fabulous things . They all represent some large truth to us . An emblem like Pegasus is as real a thing to a poet as a Derby winner would be to you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>I say .<stage>Give me a cigarette . Thanks .</stage>What ? Then you 'd believe in nymphs and fauns , and Pan , and all those kind of birds ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>Yes . Yes . In all of them .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>Good Lord !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>You believe in the Lord Mayor of London , do n't you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>Yes , of course ; but what has ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>Four million people or so made him Lord Mayor , did n't they ? And he represents to them the wealth and dignity and tradition of ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>Yes ; but , I say , what has all this ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>: Well , he stands for an idea to them , and they made him Lord</l>
       <l>Mayor , and so he is one ....</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>Well , of course he is .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>In the same way Pan has been made what he is by millions ; by millions to whom he represents world-old traditions . PRATTLE<stage>rising from his chair and stepping backwards , laughing and looking at the POET in a kind of assumed wonder</stage>I say ... I say ... You old heathen ... but Good Lord ...</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He bumps into the high screen behind , pushing it back a little .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>Look out ! Look out !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>What ? What 's the matter ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>The screen !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>Oh , sorry , yes . I 'll put it right .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He is about to go round behind it .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>No , do n't go round there .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>What ? Why not ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>Oh , you would n't understand .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>Would n't understand ? Why , what have you got ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>Oh , one of those things .... You would n't understand .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>Of course I 'd understand . Let 's have a look .<stage>The POET walks towards PRATTLE and the screen . He protests no further . PRATTLE looks round the corner of the screen .</stage>An altar . DE REVES<stage>removing the screen altogether</stage>That is all . What do you make of it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>An altar of Greek design , shaped like a pedestal , is revealed . Papers litter the floor all about it .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>I say — you always were an untidy devil .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>Well , what do you make of it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>It reminds me of your room at Eton .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>My room at Eton ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>Yes , you always had papers all over your floor .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>Oh , yes ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>And what are these ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>All these are poems ; and this is my altar to Fame .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>To Fame ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>The same that Homer knew .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>Good Lord !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>Keats never saw her . Shelley died too young . She came late at the best of times , now scarcely ever .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>But , my dear fellow , you do n't mean that you think there really is such a person ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>I offer all my songs to her .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>But you do n't mean you think you could actually see Fame ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>We poets personify abstract things , and not poets only but sculptors<stage>7</stage>and painters too . All the great things of the world are those abstract things .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>But what I mean is , they 're not really there , like you or me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>To us these things are more real than men , they outlive generations , they watch the passing of kingdoms : we go by them like dust ; they are still there , unmoved , unsmiling .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>But , but , you can n't think that you could see Fame , you do n't expect to see it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>Not to me . Never to me . She of the golden trumpet and Greek dress will never appear to me .... We all have our dreams .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>I say — what have you been doing all day ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>I ? Oh , only writing a sonnet .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>Is it a long one ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>Not very .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>About how long is it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>About fourteen lines . PRATTLE<stage>impressively</stage>I tell you what it is .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>Yes ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>I tell you what . You 've been overworking yourself . I once got like that on board the Sandhurst , working for the passing-out exam . I got so bad that I could have seen anything .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>Seen anything ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>Lord , yes ; horned pigs , snakes with wings ; anything ; one of your winged horses even . They gave me some stuff called bromide for it . You take a rest .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>But my dear fellow , you do n't understand at all . I merely said that abstract things are to a poet as near and real and visible as one of your bookmakers or barmaids .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>I know . You take a rest .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>Well , perhaps I will . I 'd come with you to that musical comedy you 're going to see , only I 'm a bit tired after writing this ; it 's a tedious job . I 'll come another night .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>How do you know I 'm going to see a musical comedy ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>Well , where would you go ? Hamlet 's</l>
       <stage>8</stage>
       <l>on at the Lord</l>
       <l>Chamberlain 's . You 're not going there .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>Do I look like it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>No .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PRATTLE</speaker>
      <p>Well , you 're quite right . I 'm going to see “ The Girl from Bedlam . ” So long . I must push off now . It 's getting late . You take a rest . Do n't add another line to that sonnet ; fourteen 's quite enough . You take a rest . Do n't have any dinner to-night , just rest . I was like that once myself . So long .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DE REVES</speaker>
      <p>So long .<stage>Exit PRATTLE . DE REVES returns to his table and sits down .</stage>Good old Dick ! He 's the same as ever . Lord , how time passes . He takes his pen and his sonnet and makes a few alterations . Well , that 's finished . I can n't do any more to it .<stage>He rises and goes to the screen ; he draws back part of it and goes up to the altar . He is about to place his sonnet reverently at the foot of the altar amongst his other verses .</stage>No , I will not put it there . This one is worthy of the altar .<stage>He places the sonnet upon the altar itself .</stage>If that sonnet does not give me fame , nothing that I have done before will give it to me , nothing that I ever will do .<stage>He replaces the screen and returns to his chair at the table . Twilight is coming on . He sits with his elbow on the table , his head on his hand , or however the actor pleases .</stage>Well , well . Fancy seeing Dick again . Well , Dick enjoys his life , so he 's no fool . What was that he said ? “ There 's no money in poetry . You 'd better chuck it . ” Ten years ’ work and what have I to show for it ? The admiration of men who care for poetry , and how many of them are there ? There 's a bigger demand for smoked glasses to look at eclipses of the sun . Why should Fame come to me ? Have n't I given up my days for her ? That is enough to keep her away . I am a poet ; that is enough reason for her to slight me . Proud and aloof and cold as marble , what does Fame care for us ? Yes , Dick is right . It 's a poor game chasing illusions , hunting the intangible , pursuing dreams . Dreams ? Why , we are ourselves dreams .<stage>He leans back in his chair .</stage>We are such stuff As dreams are made on , and our little life Is rounded with a sleep .<stage>He is silent for a while . Suddenly he lifts his head .</stage>My room at Eton , Dick said . An untidy mess .<stage>As he lifts his head and says these words , twilight gives place to broad daylight , merely as a hint that the author of the play may have been mistaken , and the whole thing may have been no more than a poet 's dream .</stage>So it was , and it 's an untidy mess there<stage>looking at screen</stage>too . Dick 's right . I 'll tidy it up . I 'll burn the whole damned heap ,<stage>He advances impetuously towards the screen .</stage>every damned poem that I was ever fool enough to waste my time on .<stage>He pushes back the screen . FAME in a Greek dress with a long golden trumpet in her hand is seen standing motionless on the altar like a marble goddess .</stage>So ... you have come !<stage>For a while he stands thunderstruck . Then he approaches the altar .</stage>Divine fair lady , you have come .<stage>He holds up his hand to her and leads her down from the altar and into the centre of the stage . At whatever moment the actor finds it most convenient , he repossesses himself of the sonnet that he had placed on the altar . He now offers it to FAME .</stage>This is my sonnet . Is it well done ?</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>FAME takes it and reads it in silence , while the POET watches her rapturously .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FAME</speaker>
      <p>You 're a bit of all right .</p>
     </sp>
