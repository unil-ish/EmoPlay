   <set>
    <p>SCENE .— The Commercial Room in an old-fashioned hotel in a small country town . An air of old-fashioned comfort is in evidence everywhere . Old sporting prints on the walls . On the table up C. are half a dozen candlesticks , old-fashioned shape with snuffer attached . Two pairs of carpet slippers are set up within fender . Red curtains to window recess . Shutters or blinds to windows . Armchair and about six other chairs in the room . One old-fashioned settle . One small table . Clock . Decanter of water , half a dozen toddy tumblers . Matches , etc . The only light is a ruddy glow from the fire . Kettle on hob . Moonlight from R. of window when shutter is opened . Practical chandelier from ceiling or lights at side of mantelpiece . DOCTOR 'S coat and muffler on chair up L ., his cap on mantelpiece . All lights out , dark stage . Opening music . Curtain rise — ticking of clock heard . Wind , then church clock chimes , the Lights come very slowly up , when the red glow is seen in the fireplace the low murmurs of the characters heard , and gradually get louder as lights come up to when SOMERS ’ voice tops all . ( The stage occupied by all characters except GEORGE the waiter . Discovered , PENFOLD , sitting in arm chair L. of fire , above it . DOCTOR LEEK standing above fire and leaning on mantel-shelf . HIRST sitting on settle below fire and nearest to audience . SOMERS seated on settle with him but above him . MALCOLM and BELDON on chairs R. C ., facing fire . ALL are smoking , and drink from their respective glasses from time to time . SOMERS has just finished a story as Curtain rises . ) OMNES . Oh , I say , that sounds impossible , etc . SOMERS . Haunted or not haunted , the fact remains that no one stays in the house long . It 's been let to several tenants since the time of the murder , but they never completed their tenancy . The last tenant held out for a month , but at last he gave up like the rest , and cleared out , although he had done the place up thoroughly , and must have been pounds out of pocket by the transaction . MALCOLM . Well , it 's a capital ghost story , I admit , that is , as a story , but I for one can n't swallow it . HIRST . I do n't know , it is not nearly so improbable as some I have heard . Of course it 's an old idea that spirits like to get into the company of human beings . A man told me once , that he travelled down by the Great Western , with a ghost as fellow passenger , and had n't the slightest suspicion of it , until the inspector came for tickets . My friend said , the way that ghost tried to keep up appearances , by feeling in all its pockets , and even looking on the floor for its ticket , was quite touching . Ultimately it gave it up , and with a loud groan vanished through the ventilator . ( SOMERS , MALCOLM and LEEK laugh heartily . ) BELDON . Oh , I say come now , that 'll do . PENFOLD ( seriously ) . Personally I do n't think it 's a subject for jesting . I have never seen an apparition myself , but I have known people who have , and I consider that they form a very interesting link between us and the after life . There 's a ghost story connected with this house , you know . OMNES . Eh ! Oh ? Really ! MALCOLM ( rising and going to mantelpiece , takes up his glass of toddy ) . Well , I have used this house for some years now . I travel for Blennet and Burgess — wool — and come here regularly three times a year , and I 've never heard of it . ( Sits down again on his chair , holding glass in his hand . ) LEEK . And I 've been here pretty often too , though I have only been in practice here for a couple of years , and I have never heard it mentioned , and I must say I do n't believe in anything of the sort . In my opinion ghosts are the invention of weak-minded idiots . PENFOLD . Weak-minded idiots or not , there is a ghost story connected with this house , but it dates a long time back . ( GEORGE , the waiter , enters D. L. with tray and serviette . ) Oh , here 's George , he 'll bear me out . You 've heard of Jerry Bundler , George ? GEORGE ( C .) . Well , I 've just ‘ eard odds and ends , sir , but I never put much count to ‘ em . There was one chap ‘ ere , who was under me when fust I come , he said he seed it , and the Guv'nor sacked him there and then . ( Goes to table by window , puts tray down , takes up glass and wipes it slowly . ) ( MEN laugh . ) PENFOLD . Well , my father was a native of this town , and he knew the story well . He was a truthful man and a steady churchgoer . But I have heard him declare that once in his life he saw the ghost of Jerry Bundler in this house ; let me see , George , you do n't remember my old dad , do you ? ( GEORGE puts down glasses over table . ) GEORGE . No , sir . I come here forty years ago next Easter , but I fancy he was before my time . PENFOLD . Yes , though not by long . He died when I was twenty , and I shall be sixty-two next month , but that 's neither here nor there . ( GEORGE goes up to table C. tidying up and listening . ) LEEK . Who was this Jerry Bundler ?</p>
   </set>
   <titlePage>
    <docImprint>PENFOLD . A<settlement>London</settlement>thief , pickpocket , highwayman — anything he could turn his dishonest hand to , and he was run to earth in this house some eighty years ago . ( GEORGE puts glass down and stands listening . ) He took his last supper in this room . ( PENFOLD leans forward . BELDON looks round to L . nervously . ) That night soon after he had gone to bed , a couple of Bow Street runners , the predecessors of our present detective force turned up here . They had followed him from<settlement>London</settlement>, but had lost scent a bit , so did n't arrive till late . A word to the landlord , whose description of the stranger who had retired to rest , pointed to the fact that he was the man they were after , of course enlisted his aid and that of the male servants and stable hands . The officers crept quietly up to Jerry 's bedroom and tried the door , it would n't budge . It was of heavy oak and bolted from within . ( OMNES lean forward , showing interest . ) Leaving his comrade and a couple of grooms to guard the bedroom door , the other officer went into the yard , and , procuring a short ladder , by this means reached the window of the room in which Jerry was sleeping . The Inn servants and stable hands saw him get on to the sill and try to open the window . Suddenly there was a crash of glass , and with a cry , he fell in a heap on to the stones at their feet . Then in the moonlight , they saw the face of the highwayman peering over the sill . ( OMNES move uneasily . ) They sent for the blacksmith , and with his sledge-hammer he battered in the strong oak panels , and the first thing that met their eyes was the body of Jerry Bundler dangling from the top of the four-post bed by his own handkerchief . ( OMNES sit back , draw their breath , and are generally uneasy . Slight pause . ) SOMERS . I say , which bedroom was it ? ( Earnestly ) . PENFOLD . That I can n't tell you , but the story goes that Jerry still haunts this house , and my father used to declare positively that the last time he slept here , the ghost of Jerry Bundler lowered itself from the top of his four-post bed and tried to strangle him . BELDON ( jumps up , gets behind his chair , twists chair round ; nervously ) . O , I say , that 'll do . I wish you 'd thought to ask your father which bedroom it was . PENFOLD . What for ? BELDON . Well , I should take jolly good care not to sleep in it , that 's all . ( Goes to back . ) ( PENFOLD rising , goes to fire , and knocks out his pipe , Leek gets by arm-chair . ) PENFOLD . There 's nothing to fear . I do n't believe for a moment that ghosts could really hurt one . ( GEORGE lights candle at table . ) In fact , my father used to say that it was only the unpleasantness of the thing that upset him , and that , for all practical purposes , Jerry 's fingers might have been made of cotton wool for all the harm they could do . ( GEORGE hands candle , gets to door and holds it open . ) BELDON . That 's all very fine , a ghost story is a ghost story , but when a gentleman tells a tale of a ghost that haunts the house in which one is going to sleep , I call it most ungentlemanly . ( BELDON places his chair to L. of table R. PENFOLD goes up to C. LEEK sits in arm chair . BELDON goes to fireplace . ) PENFOLD . Pooh ! Nonsense . ( At table up C .) . ( During his speech George lights one of the candles . ) Ghosts can n't hurt you . For my own part , I should rather like to see one . OMNES . Oh , come now —— etc . PENFOLD . Well , I 'll bid you good-night , gentlemen . ( He goes towards door L. GEORGE opens it for him ; he passes out as they all say . ) OMNES . Good-night . ( HIRST rises , crosses to L. C .) BELDON ( up R ., calling after him ) . And I hope Jerry 'll pay you a visit . MALCOLM ( rises , goes to fire ) . Well , I 'm going to have another whisky if you gentlemen will join me . I think it 'll do us all good after that tale . George , take the orders . ( GEORGE comes down with salver to table R ., gathers up glasses . ) SOMERS . Not quite so much hot water in mine . MALCOLM . I 'll have the same again , George . BELDON . A leetle bit of lemon in mine , George . LEEK . Whisky and soda for me , please . HIRST . Whisky ! ( GEORGE goes to table R ., collects glasses , crosses to door L . speaks . ) GEORGE ( to MALCOLM ) . Shall I light the gas , Mr. Malcolm ? ( At door . ) MALCOLM . No , the fire 's very comfortable , unless any of you gentlemen prefer the gas . OMNES . No , not at all — etc . MALCOLM . Never mind , George . ( This to GEORGE as no one wants the gas . ) The firelight is pleasanter . ( Exit GEORGE for orders L .) ( BELDON gets C .) MALCOLM ( at fire ) . Does any gentleman know another ——? SOMERS ( seated R .) . Well , I remember hearing —— BELDON ( up C .) . Oh , I say — that 'll do . ( OMNES laugh . ) LEEK . Yes , I think you all look as if you 'd heard enough ghost stories to do you the rest of your lives . And you 're not all as anxious to see the real article as the old gentleman who 's just gone . HIRST ( looking to L .) . Old humbug ! I should like to put him to the test . ( C .) ( Bus . ) I say , suppose I dress up as Jerry Bundler and go and give him a chance of displaying his courage ? I bet I 'd make the old party sit up . MALCOLM . Capital ! BELDON . A good idea . LEEK . I should n't , if I were you . HIRST . Just for the joke , gentlemen ( C .) . SOMERS . No , no — drop it , Hirst . HIRST . Only for the joke . Look here , I 've got some things that 'll do very well . We 're going to have some amateur theatricals at my house . We 're doing a couple of scenes from “ The Rivals , ” Somers , ( pointing to SOMERS ) and I have been up to town to get the costumes , wigs , etc ., to-day . I 've got them up-stairs — knee-breeches , stockings , buckled shoes , and all that sort of thing . It 's a rare chance . If you wait a bit , I 'll give you a full dress rehearsal , entitled “ Jerry Bundler , or the Nocturnal Stranger . ” ( At door L .) . LEEK ( sneeringly ) . You wo n't frighten us , will you ? HIRST . I do n't know so much about that — it 's a question of acting , that 's all . MALCOLM . I 'll bet you a level sov , you do n't frighten me . HIRST ( quietly ) . A level sov . ( Pauses . ) Done . I 'll take the bet to frighten you first , and the old boy afterwards . These gentlemen shall be the judges . ( Points to LEEK and BELDON . ) BELDON ( up C .) . You wo n't frighten us because we 're prepared for you , but you 'd better leave the old man alone . It 's dangerous play . ( Appeals to LEEK ) . HIRST . Well , I 'll try you first . ( Moves to door and pauses . ) No gas , mind . OMNES . No ! no ! HIRST ( laughs ) . I 'll give you a run for your money . ( GEORGE enters , holds door open . ) ( Exit HIRST . ) ( GEORGE passes drinks round . Five drinks . SOMERS takes the one ordered for HIRST and puts it on the table R. BELDON sits R. C. GEORGE crosses to table , puts two drinks down , goes to fire and gives drinks , then up to table , puts tray down , takes up glass and begins to wipe it , gets down L. for lines . )</docImprint>

    <p>LEEK ( to MALCOLM ) . I think you 'll win your bet , sir , but I vote we give him a chance . Suppose we have cigars round , and if he 's not back by the time we 've finished them I must be off , as I have a quarter of an hour 's walk before me . ( Looks at watch . ) He 's a friend of yours , is n't he ? SOMERS . Yes , I have known him a good many years now , and I must say he 's a rum chap ; just crazy about acting and practical joking , though I 've often told him he carries the latter too far at times . In this case it does n't matter , but I wo n't let him try it on the old gentleman . You see we know what he 's going to do , and are prepared , but he does n't , and it might lead to illness or worse ; the old chap 's sixty-two and such a shock might have serious consequences . But Hirst wo n't mind giving up that part of it , so long as he gets an opportunity of acting to us . LEEK ( knocks pipe on grate ) . Well , I hope he 'll hurry up . It 's getting pretty late . ( To SOMERS . ) MALCOLM . Well , gentlemen , your health ! SOMERS . Good luck . LEEK . Hurrah ! BELDON . Chin-chin ! LEEK . By the way , how is it you happen to be here to-night ? SOMERS . Oh , we missed the connection at Tolleston Junction and as the accommodation at the Railway Arms there was rather meagre , the Station Master advised us to drive on here , put up for the night , and catch the Great Northern express from Exton in the morning . ( Rises , crosses to L .) Oh , George , that reminds me — you might see that ‘ Boots ’ calls us at 7 sharp . ( BELDON rises , goes up to them to fire . ) GEORGE . Certainly , sir . What are your numbers ? SOMERS . 13 and 14 . GEORGE . I 'll put it on the slate , special , sir . ( Goes to door L .) LEEK . I beg pardon , gentlemen , I forgot the cigars ; George , bring some cigars back with you . BELDON . A very mild one for me . GEORGE . Very well , sir . ( Takes up tray from sideboard . ) ( Exit L .) ( SOMERS sits R. C .) MALCOLM . I think you were very wise coming on here . ( Sits on settle R .) I stayed at the Railway Arms , Tolleston , once — never again though . Is your friend clever at acting ? SOMERS . I do n't think he 's clever enough to frighten you . I 'm to spend Christmas at his place , and he 's asked me to assist at the theatricals he spoke of . Nothing would satisfy him till I consented , and I must honestly say I am very sorry I ever did , for I expect I shall be pretty bad . I know I have scarcely slept a wink these last few nights , trying to get the words into my head . ( GEORGE enters backwards , pale and trembling . ) MALCOLM . Why ! Look — what the devil 's the matter with George ? ( Crosses to GEORGE . ) GEORGE . I 've seen it , gentlemen . ( Down stage L. C .) OMNES . Seen who ? ( BELDON down R. edge of table R. LEEK up R. C. SOMERS up R .) GEORGE . The ghost . Jer — Bun — MALCOLM . Why , you 're frightened , George . GEORGE . Yes , sir . It was the suddenness of it , and besides I did n't look for seeing it in the bar . There was only a glimmer of light there , and it was sitting on the floor . I nearly touched it . MALCOLM ( goes to door , looks off , then returns — to others ) . It must be Hirst up to his tricks . George was out of the room when he suggested it . ( To GEORGE . ) Pull yourself together , man . GEORGE . Yes , sir — but it took me unawares . I 'd never have gone to the bar by myself if I 'd known it was there , and I do n't believe you would , either , sir . MALCOLM . Nonsense , I 'll go and fetch him in . ( Crosses to L .) GEORGE ( clutching him by the sleeve ) . You do n't know what it 's like , sir . It ai n't fit to look at by yourself , it ai n't indeed . It 's got the awfullest deathlike face , and short cropped red hair — it 's — ( Smothered cry is heard . ) What 's that ? ( Backs to C and leans on chair . ) ( ALL start , and a quick pattering of footsteps is heard rapidly approaching the room . The door flies open and HIRST flings himself gasping and shivering into MALCOLM 'S arms . The door remains open . He has only his trousers and shirt on , his face very white with fear and his own hair all standing on end . LEEK lights the gas , then goes to R. of HIRST . ) OMNES . What 's the matter ? MALCOLM . Why , it 's Hirst . ( Shakes him roughly by the shoulder . ) What 's up ? HIRST . I 've seen — oh , Lord ! I 'll never play the fool again . ( Goes C .) OTHERS . Seen what ? HIRST . Him — it — the ghost — anything . MALCOLM ( uneasily ) . Rot ! HIRST . I was coming down the stairs to get something I 'd forgotten , when I felt a tap — ( He breaks off suddenly gazing through open door . ) I thought I saw it again — Look — at the foot of the stairs , can n't you see anything ? ( Shaking LEEK . ) LEEK ( crosses to door peering down passage ) . No , there 's nothing there . ( Stays up L .) ( HIRST gives a sigh of relief . ) MALCOLM ( L. C .) . Go on — you felt a tap —— HIRST ( C .) . I turned and saw it — a little wicked head with short red hair — and a white dead face — horrible . ( Clock chimes three-quarters . ) ( They assist him into chair L. of table R .) GEORGE ( up C .) . That 's what I saw in the bar — ‘ orrid — it was devilish . ( Coming C .) ( MALCOLM crosses to L. HIRST shudders . ) MALCOLM . Well , it 's a most unaccountable thing . It 's the last time I come to this house . ( Goes to R. of LEEK . ) GEORGE . I leave to-morrow . I would n't go down to that bar alone — no , not for fifty pounds . ( Goes up R. to arm-chair . ) SOMERS ( crosses to door R. then returns to R. C .) . It 's talking about the thing that 's caused it , I expect . We 've had it in our minds , and we 've been practically forming a spiritualistic circle without knowing it . ( Goes to back of table R .) BELDON ( crosses to R. C .) . Hang the old gentleman . Upon my soul I 'm half afraid to go to bed . MALCOLM . Doctor , it 's odd they should both think they saw something . ( They both drop down L. C .) GEORGE ( up C .) . I saw it as plainly as I see you , sir . P'raps if you keep your eyes turned up the passage you 'll see it for yourself . ( Points . ) ( They all look . BELDON goes to SOMERS . ) BELDON . There — what was that ? MALCOLM . Who 'll go with me to the bar ! LEEK . I will . ( Goes to door . ) BELDON ( gulps ) . So — will I . ( Crosses to door L. They go to the door . To MALCOLM . ) After you . ( They slowly pass into the passage . GEORGE watching them . All exit except HIRST and SOMERS . ) SOMERS . How do you feel now , old man ? HIRST ( changing his frightened manner to one of assurance ) . Splendid ! SOMERS . But — ( a step back . ) HIRST . I tell you I feel splendid . SOMERS . But the ghost — ( Steps back to C .) HIRST . Well , upon my word , Somers — you 're not as sharp as I thought you . SOMERS . What do you mean ? HIRST . Why , that I was the ghost George saw . ( Crosses to L. C .) By Jove , he was in a funk ! I followed him to the door and overheard his description of what he 'd seen , then I burst in myself and pretended I 'd seen it too . I 'm going to win that , bet — ( VOICES heard . Crosses to R .) Look out , they 're coming back . ( Sits . ) SOMERS . Yes , but —— HIRST . Do n't give me away — hush ! ( Re-enter MALCOLM , LEEK , BELDON and GEORGE L .) ( BELDON and GEORGE go up to back C .) HIRST . Did you see it ? ( In his frightened manner . ) MALCOLM ( C .) I do n't know — I thought I saw something , but it might have been fancy . I 'm in the mood to see anything just now . ( To HIRST . ) How are you feeling now , sir ? HIRST . Oh , I feel a bit better now . I daresay you think I 'm easily scared — but you did n't see it . MALCOLM . Well , I 'm not quite sure . ( Goes to fire . ) LEEK . You 've had a bit of a shock . Best thing you can do is to go to bed . HIRST ( finishing his drink ) . Very well . Will you , ( rises ) share my room with me , Somers ? ( GEORGE lights two candles . ) SOMERS ( crosses to L. C .) . I will with pleasure . ( Gets up to table C. and gets a candle ) . Provided you do n't mind sleeping with the gas full on all night . ( Goes to door L .) LEEK ( to HIRST ) . You 'll be all right in the morning . HIRST . Good night , all . ( As he crosses to door . ) OMNES . Good night . ( ALL talking at fire , not looking to L. as HIRST and SOMERS exeunt . HIRST chuckles and gives SOMERS a sly dig . ) SOMERS . Good night . MALCOLM ( at fireplace ) . Well , I suppose the bet 's off , though as far as I can see I won it . I never saw a man so scared in all my life . Sort of poetic justice about it . ( LEEK with revolver in his hand , is just putting it into his pocket . Seeing him . ) Why , what 's that you 've got there ? LEEK . A revolver . ( At fire . ) You see I do a lot of night driving , visiting patients in outlying districts — they 're a tough lot round here , and one never knows what might happen , so I have been accustomed to carry it . I just pulled it out so as to have it handy . I meant to have a pot at that ghost if I had seen him . There 's no law against it , is there ? I never heard of a close time for ghosts . BELDON .— Oh , I say , never mind ghosts . Will you share my room ? ( To MALCOLM . ) ( GEORGE comes down a little , holding candle . ) MALCOLM . With pleasure . I 'm not exactly frightened , but I 'd sooner have company , and I daresay George here would be glad to be allowed to make up a bed on the floor . BELDON . Certainly . MALCOLM . Well , that 's settled . A majority of three to one ought to stop any ghost . Will that arrangement suit you , George ? GEORGE . Thank you , sir . And if you gentlemen would kindly come down to the bar with me while I put out the gas . I could never be sufficiently grateful , and when ( at door ) we come back we can let the Doctor out at the front door . Will that do , sir ? LEEK . All right ; I 'll be getting my coat on . ( GEORGE gets to door . They exit at door L. LEEK picks up his coat off chair up L ., puts it on and then turns up trousers . Footsteps heard in flies , then goes to the window R ., pulls curtain aside and opens the shutters of the window nearest the fire . A flood of moonlight streams in from R. Clock strikes twelve . ) By Jove , what a lovely night . That poor devil did get a fright , and no mistake . ( Crossing down to fireplace for his cap which is on the mantelpiece . MALCOLM , BELDON and GEORGE return — the door closes after them . ) Well , no sign of it , eh ? MALCOLM . No , we 've seen nothing this time . Here , give me the candle , George , while you turn out the gas . LEEK . All right , George , I 'll put this one out . ( Turns out gas below fire . ) ( MALCOLM and BELDON are up at sideboard , GEORGE having put the other gas out , goes up to them and is just lighting the candles for them . The DOCTOR is filling his pipe at mantel-shelf , and stooping to get a light with a paper spill . LEEK whistles and lights spill . The handle of the door is heard moving . OMNES stand motionless — MALCOLM and BELDON very frightened . They all watch . The room is lit only by the firelight which is very much fainter than it was at the beginning of the play , by the candle which GEORGE holds , and by the flood of moonlight from the window . ) ( The door slowly opens , a hand is seen , then a figure appears in dark breeches , white stockings , buckled shoes , white shirt , very neat in every detail , with a long white or spotted handkerchief tied round the neck , the long end hanging down in front . The face cadaverous , with sunken eyes and a leering smile , and close cropped red hair . The figure blinks at the candle , then slowly raises its hands and unties the handkerchief , its head falls on to one shoulder , it holds handkerchief out at arm 's length and advances towards MALCOLM . )</p>

The fictitious wedding had been arranged by the boys in a moment of need in order to get “ Doc 's ” family in the West to send on wedding presents that could be pawned .

    <p>A comedy in 3 acts . By William Ford Manley . Produced originally at the Times Square Theatre , New York . 30 males , 15 females . 4 interior scenes . Modern costumes . A rollicking farce about what transpires behind the microphone of a broadcasting studio . The most popular singing artist in Station WWVW is Roy Denny . Through some mischance it comes about that the Denny “ golden voice ” is really John Duffy . Duffy , being a nervous lad , has always failed miserably from microphone fright whenever he has attempted to sing under his own name . When he croons under Denny 's name he kindles the divine hope in female breasts clear across this palpitating country . But Denny receives all the credit . This hoax destroys Duffy 's personal love life and results in a conspiracy inside Station WWVW . As a sort of undercurrent to the narrative it introduces satiric bits about the buncombe of radio broadcasting . The play offers fine opportunities for the introduction of musical numbers and comedy acts .</p>

    <p>A farcical comedy in 3 acts . By Ian Hay and Stephen King-Hall . Produced originally at the Times Square Theatre , New York . 9 males , 6 females . Modern costumes and naval uniforms . 2 interior scenes . During a reception on board H. M. S. “ Falcon , ” a cruiser on the China Station , Captain Randall of the Marines has become engaged to Fay Eaton , and in his enthusiasm induces her to stay and have dinner in his cabin . This is met with stern disapproval by Fay 's chaperon , Charlotte Hopkinson , who insists that they leave at once . Charlotte , however , gets shut up in the compass room , and a gay young American widow accepts the offer to take her place , both girls intending to go back to shore in the late evening . Of course , things go wrong , and they have to remain aboard all night . By this time the Captain has to be told , because his cabin contains the only possible accommodations , and he enters into the conspiracy without signalling the Admiral 's flagship . Then the “ Falcon ” is suddenly ordered to sea , and the Admiral decides to sail with her . This also makes necessary the turning over to him of the Captain 's quarters . The presence of the ladies now becomes positively embarrassing . The girls are bundled into one cabin just opposite that occupied by the Admiral . The game of “ general-post ” with a marine sentry in stockinged feet is very funny , and so are the attempts to explain matters to the “ Old Man ” next morning . After this everything ends both romantically and happily .</p>

    <p>A comedy in 3 acts . By Myron C. Fagan . Produced originally at the Vanderbilt Theatre , New York . 4 males , 5 females . 2 interior scenes . Modern costumes . Nothing is really private any more — not even pajamas and bedtime stories . No one will object to Nancy 's private affair being made public , and it would be impossible to interest the theatre public in a more ingenious plot . Nancy is one of those smart , sophisticated society women who wants to win back her husband from a baby vamp . Just how this is accomplished makes for an exceptionally pleasant evening . Laying aside her horn-rimmed spectacles , she pretends indifference and affects a mysterious interest in other men . Nancy baits her rival with a bogus diamond ring , makes love to her former husband 's best friend , and finally tricks the dastardly rival into a marriage with someone else . Mr. Fagan has studded his story with jokes and retorts that will keep any audience in a constant uproar .</p>

    <p>A comedy in 3 acts . By Nat N. Dorfman . Produced originally at the 48th Street Theatre in New York . 7 males , 6 females . 1 interior scene . Modern costumes . Few of us have escaped getting our fingers burnt in the crash of the stock market , and even those of us who have , have heard enough about it to take a sympathetic and amused interest in the doings of Henry Merrill when he tries to buck the game and grow rich . The play starts just two months before the crash . Henry , of the local soap works , is so heavy an investor in an oil stock that he is made a thirty-sixth Vice President of the Corporation . Not being the kind of fellow who would forget his friends in this time of good fortune , he lets them all in on the good thing . Being humanly greedy , the friends jump at the chance to profit .... In the second act , after Henry 's daughter has eloped , the friends are presenting Henry with a diamond-studded wrist watch , as a token of their esteem , when news comes of the Wall Street upheaval and all are wiped out . Things , however , are not as bad as they look , for Henry , who has an invention to revolutionize the soap industry , sells the idea for a large price and everything is all right again .</p>

    <speaker>PETER FLIES HIGH</speaker>
    <p>A comedy in 3 acts . By Myron C. Fagan . Produced originally at the Gaiety Theatre , New York . 8 males , 6 females . 1 interior scene . Modern costumes . This delightful comedy concerns one Peter Turner who caddied for the Morgans , the Kahns and the Guggenheims on the links at Miami . It was during one of these rounds on the golf links that Peter fell over and killed a stray dog . The local paper built the story up so that Peter becomes a nation-wide hero who saved the lives of many people by strangling a mad canine . By the time the story reaches his home town , Rosedale , New Jersey , Peter has become the boon companion of all the money kings — at least in the public mind — and Peter does his best to foster the deception . Carried away by his imagination he pretends to be a friend of the great , persuades his brother-in-law to buy an option to a ninety-acre lot on the assumption that “ Guggenheim ” is to build a golf course there , obtains $ 10 , 000 from the local banker and then becomes badly involved in his deceptions . After Peter endures the ridicule of his townsfolk and the ire of the banker there suddenly appears on the scene a representative of “ Guggenheim ” who wants the acreage not for a golf course but an air field , and promptly turns over a check for $ 75 , 000 for a part of it .</p>
