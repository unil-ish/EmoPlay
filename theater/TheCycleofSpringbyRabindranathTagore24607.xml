    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>The King is greatly troubled in his mind</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Well</role>
     <roleDesc>I 've got some very important news about the frontier war</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>War we may have</role>
     <roleDesc>but not the news</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Then the Chinese Ambassador is waiting to see His Majesty</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Let him wait . Anyhow he can n't see the King</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Ca n't see the King ?— Ah</role>
     <roleDesc>here is the King at last . Look at him coming this way , with a mirror in his hand . “ Long live the King . Long live the King . ”</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>If it please Your Majesty</role>
     <roleDesc>it is time to go to the Court</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Time to go ? Yes</role>
     <roleDesc>time to go , but not to the Court</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>What does Your Majesty mean ?</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Have n't you heard ? The bell has just been rung to dismiss the Court</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>When ? What bell ? We have n't heard any bell</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>How could you hear ? They have rung it in my ears alone</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Oh</role>
     <roleDesc>Sire . No one can have had the impertinence to do that</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Vizier ! They are ringing it now</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Pardon me</role>
     <roleDesc>Sire , if I am very stupid ; but I cannot understand</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Look at this</role>
     <roleDesc>Vizier , look at this</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Your Majesty 's hair ——</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Ca n't you see there 's a bell-ringer there ?</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Oh</role>
     <roleDesc>Your Majesty . Are you playing a joke ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>The joke is not mine , but His , who has got the whole world by the ear , and is having His jest . Last night , when the Queen was putting a garland of jasmines round my neck , she cried out with alarm , “ King , what is this ? Here are two grey hairs behind your ear . ”</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Oh , please , Sire , do n't worry so much about a little thing like that . Why ! The royal physician ——</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Vizier ! The founder of our dynasty had his royal physician , too . But what could he do ? Death has left his card of invitation behind my ear . The Queen wanted , then and there , to pluck out the grey hairs . But I said , “ Queen , what 's the use ? You may remove Death 's invitation , but can you remove Death , the Inviter ? ” So , for the present ——</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Yes , Sire , for the present , let us attend to business</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Business</role>
     <roleDesc>Vizier ! I have no time for business . Send for the Pundit . Send for Sruti-bhushan</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>But</role>
     <roleDesc>Sire , the General ——</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>The General ?— No</role>
     <roleDesc>no , not the General . Send for the Pundit</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>But</role>
     <roleDesc>the news from the frontier ——</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Vizier</role>
     <roleDesc>the news has come to me from the last great frontier of all , the frontier of Death . Send for the Pundit</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>But if Your Majesty will give me one moment</role>
     <roleDesc>the Ambassador from the great Emperor of China ——</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Vizier</role>
     <roleDesc>a greater Emperor has sent his embassy to me . Call Sruti-bhushan</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Very well</role>
     <roleDesc>Sire . But your father-in-law ——</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>It is not my father-in-law whom I want now . Send for the Pundit</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>But , if it please you to hear me this once . The poet , Kabi-shekhar , is waiting with his new book called the Garden of Poesy</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Let your poet disport himself</role>
     <roleDesc>jumping about on the topmost branches of his Garden of Poesy , but send for the Pundit</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Very well</role>
     <roleDesc>Sire . I will send for him at once</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Tell him to bring his book of devotions with him</role>
     <roleDesc>called the Ocean of Renunciation</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Yes</role>
     <roleDesc>Sire</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>But</role>
     <roleDesc>Vizier . Who are those outside making all that noise ? Go out and stop them at once . I must have peace</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>If it please Your Majesty</role>
     <roleDesc>there is a famine in Nagapatam and the headmen of the villages are praying to be allowed to see your face</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>My time is short</role>
     <roleDesc>Vizier . I must have peace</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>They say their time is shorter . They are at death 's door . They , too , want peace ,— peace from the burning of hunger</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Vizier ! The burning of hunger is quenched at last on the funeral pyre</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Then these wretched people ——</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Wretched !— Listen to the advice of a wretched King to his wretched subjects . It is futile to be impatient</role>
     <roleDesc>and try to break through the net of the inexorable Fisherman . Sooner or later , Death the Fisherman will have his haul</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Well then ?</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Let me have the Pundit</role>
     <roleDesc>and his Book of Renunciation</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>And in this scarcity ——</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Vizier ! The real scarcity is of time , and not of food . We are all suffering from starvation of time . None of us has enough of it , neither the King , nor his people</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Then ——</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Then know</role>
     <roleDesc>that our petitions for more time will all go to the last fire of doom . So why strain our voice in prayer ?— Ah , here is Sruti-bhushan at last . My reverence to you</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Pundit</role>
     <roleDesc>do tell the King that the Goddess of Fortune deserts him who gives way to melancholy</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Sruti-bhushan</role>
     <roleDesc>what is my Vizier whispering to you ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>He tells me</role>
     <roleDesc>King , to instruct you in the ways of fortune</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>What instruction can you give ?</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>There is a verse in my book of devotions which runs as follows :</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Fortune , as fickle as lotus-flower ,</role>
     <roleDesc>Closes her favours when comes the hour . Oh , foolish man , how can you trust her , Who comes of a sudden , and goes in a fluster ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Ah</role>
     <roleDesc>Pundit . One breath of your teaching blows out the false flame of ambition . Our teacher has said</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>“ Teeth fall out , hair grows grey ;</role>
     <roleDesc>Yet man clings to hope that plays him false . ”</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Well , King , now that you have introduced the subject of hope , let me give you another verse from the Ocean of Renunciation . It runs as follows :</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>That fetters are binding , all are aware ;</role>
     <roleDesc>But fetters of hope are strange , I declare . Hope 's captive is tossed in the whirlpool 's wake , And only grows still when the fetters break</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Ah</role>
     <roleDesc>Pundit . Your words are priceless . Vizier , give him a hundred gold sequins at once . What 's that noise outside ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>It is the famine-stricken people</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Tell them to hold their peace</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Let Sruti-bhushan , with his book of devotions , go and try to bring them peace ; and , in the meanwhile , Your Majesty might discuss war matters ——</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>No</role>
     <roleDesc>no . Let the war matters come later . I can n't let Sruti-bhushan go yet</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>King , you said something to me , a moment ago , about a gift of gold . Now mere gold , by itself , does not confer any permanent benefit . It is said in my book of devotions , called the Ocean of Renunciation :</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>He who gives gold , gives only pain ;</role>
     <roleDesc>When the gold is spent grief comes again . When a lakh , or crore , of gold is spent , Grief only remains in the empty tent</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Ah</role>
     <roleDesc>Pundit . How exquisite . So you do n't want any gold , my Master ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>No , King , I do n't want gold , but something more permanent , which would make your merit permanent also . I should be quite content , if you gave me the living of Kanchanpur . For it is said in the Renunciation ——</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>No</role>
     <roleDesc>Pundit , I quite understand . You need n't quote scripture to support your claim . I understand quite well — Vizier !</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Yes</role>
     <roleDesc>Your Majesty</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>See that the rich province of Kanchanpur is settled on the Pundit .— What 's the matter now outside there ? What are they crying for ?</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>If it please Your Majesty</role>
     <roleDesc>it is the people</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Why do they cry so repeatedly ?</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Their cry is repeated</role>
     <roleDesc>I admit , but the reason remains most monotonously the same . They are starving</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>But , King , I must tell you before I forget it . It is the one desire of my wife to make her whole body jingle , from head to foot , in praise of your munificence ; but , alas , the sound is too feeble for want of proper ornaments</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>I understand you</role>
     <roleDesc>Pundit . Vizier ! Order ornaments from the Court Jeweller for Sruti-bhushan 's wife immediately</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>And , King , while he is about it , would you tell the Vizier , that we are both of us distracted in our devotions by house-repairs . Let him ask the royal masons to put up a thoroughly well-built house , where we can practise our devotions in peace</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Very well</role>
     <roleDesc>Pundit .— Vizier !</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Yes</role>
     <roleDesc>Your Majesty</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Give the order at once</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Sire</role>
     <roleDesc>your treasury is empty . Funds are wanting</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Pooh ! That 's an old story . I hear that every year . It is your business to increase the funds</role>
     <roleDesc>and mine to increase the wants . What do you say , Sruti-bhushan ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>King , I cannot blame the Vizier . He is looking after your treasures in this world . We are looking after your treasures in the next . So where he sees want , we see wealth . Now , if you would only let me dive deep once more into the Ocean of Renunciation you will find it written as follows :</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>That King 's coffers are well stored ,</role>
     <roleDesc>Where wealth alone on worth is poured</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Pundit</role>
     <roleDesc>your company is most valuable</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Your Majesty , Sruti-bhushan knows its value to a farthing . Come , Sruti-bhushan , make haste . Let us collect all the wealth you need for your Treasury of Devotion . For wealth has the ugly habit of diminishing fast . If we are not quick about it , little will remain to enable us to observe our renunciation with all splendour</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Yes , Vizier , let us go at once</role>
     <roleDesc>To the King . ) When he is making such a fuss about a tiny matter like this , it is best to pacify him first and then return to you afterwards</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Pundit , I am afraid that , some day , you will leave my royal protection altogether , and retire to the forest</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>King , so long as I find contentment in a King 's palace , it is as good as a hermitage for my peace of mind . I must now leave you , King . Vizier , let us go</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>[ The Vizier and Pundit go out .</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Oh , dear me ! Whatever shall I do ? Here 's the Poet coming . I am afraid he 'll make me break all my good resolutions .— Oh , my grey hairs , cover my ears , so that the Poet 's allurements may not enter</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Why</role>
     <roleDesc>King , what 's the matter ? I hear you want to send away your Poet</roleDesc>

     <role>What have I to do with poets</role>
     <roleDesc>when poetry brings me this parting message ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>What parting message ?</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Look at this behind my ear . Do n't you see it ?</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>See what ? Grey hairs ? Why</role>
     <roleDesc>King , do n't you worry about that</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Poet</role>
     <roleDesc>Nature is trying to rub out the green of youth , and to paint everything white</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>No , no , King . You have n't understood the artist . On that white ground , Nature will paint new colours</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>I do n't see any sign of colours yet</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>They are all within . In the heart of the white dwell all the colours of the rainbow</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Oh</role>
     <roleDesc>Poet , do be quiet . You disturb me when you talk like that</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>King , if this youth fades , let it fade . Another Queen of Youth is coming . And she is putting a garland of pure white jasmines round your head , in order to be your bride . The wedding festival is being made ready , behind the scene</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Oh , dear , Poet . You will undo everything . Do go away . Ho there , Guard . Go at once and call Sruti-bhushan</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>What will you do with him</role>
     <roleDesc>King , when he comes ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>I will compose my mind</role>
     <roleDesc>and practise my renunciation</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Ah , King , when I heard that news , I came at once . For I can be your companion in this practice of renunciation</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>You ?</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Yes</role>
     <roleDesc>I , King . We Poets exist for this very purpose . We set men free from their desires</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>I do n't understand you . You talk in riddles</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>What ? You do n't understand me ? And yet you have been reading my poems all this while !— There is renunciation in our words , renunciation in the metre , renunciation in our music . That is why fortune always forsakes us ; and we , in turn always forsake fortune . We go about , all day long , initiating the youths in the sacred cult of fortune-forsaking</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>What does it say to us ?</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>It says :</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>“ Ah , brothers , do n't cling to your goods and chattels ,</role>
     <roleDesc>And sit ever in the corner of your room . Come out , come out into the open world . Come out into the highways of life . Come out , ye youthful Renouncers . ”</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>But</role>
     <roleDesc>Poet , do you really mean to say that the highway of the open world is the pathway of renunciation ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Why not , King ? In the open world all is change , all is life , all is movement . And he who ever moves and journeys with this life-movement , dancing and playing on his flute as he goes , he is the true Renouncer . He is the true disciple of the minstrel Poet</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>But how then can I get peace ? I must have peace</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Oh</role>
     <roleDesc>King , we have n't the least desire for peace . We are the Renouncers</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>But ought we not to get that treasure</role>
     <roleDesc>which is said to be never-changing ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>No</role>
     <roleDesc>we do n't covet any never-changing treasures . We are the Renouncers</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>What do you mean ? Oh , dear , Poet , you will undo everything , if you talk like that . You are destroying my peace of mind . Call Sruti-bhushan . Let some one call the Pundit</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>What I mean , King , is this . We are the true Renouncers , because change is our very secret . We lose , in order to find . We have no faith in the never-changing</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>What do you mean ?</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Have n't you noticed the detachment of the rushing river , as it runs splashing from its mountain cave ? It gives itself away so swiftly , and only thus it finds itself . What is never-changing , for the river , is the desert sand , where it loses its course</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Ah</role>
     <roleDesc>but listen , Poet — listen to those cries there outside . That is your world . How do you deal with that ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>King</role>
     <roleDesc>they are your starving people</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>My people</role>
     <roleDesc>Poet ? Why do you call them that ? They are the world 's people , not mine . Have I created their miseries ? What can your youthful Poet Renouncers do to relieve sufferings like theirs ? Tell me that</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>King , it is we alone who can truly bear those sufferings , because we are like the river that flows on in gladness , thus lightening our burden , and the burden of the world . But the hard , metalled road is fixed and never-changing . And so it makes the burden more burdensome . The heavy loads groan and creak along it , and cut deep gashes in its breast . We Poets call to every one to carry all their joys and sorrows lightly , in a rhythmic measure . Our call is the Renouncers ’ call</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Ah , Poet , now I do n't care a straw for Sruti-bhushan . Let the Pundit go hang . But , do you know what my trouble is now ? Though I can n't , for the life of me , understand your words , the music haunts me . Now , it 's just the other way round with the Pundit . His words are clear enough , and they obey the rules of syntax quite correctly . But the tune !— No , it 's no use telling you any further</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>King</role>
     <roleDesc>our words do n't speak , they sing</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Well</role>
     <roleDesc>Poet , what do you want to do now ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>King</role>
     <roleDesc>I 'm going to have a race through those cries , which are rising outside your gate</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>What do you mean ? Famine relief is for men of business . Poets ought n't to have anything to do with things like that</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>King</role>
     <roleDesc>business men always make their business so out of tune . That is why we Poets hasten to tune it</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Now come</role>
     <roleDesc>my dear Poet , do speak in plainer language</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>King , they work , because they must . We work , because we are in love with life . That is why they condemn us as unpractical , and we condemn them as lifeless</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>But who is right</role>
     <roleDesc>Poet ? Who wins ? You , or they ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>We</role>
     <roleDesc>King , we . We always win</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>But</role>
     <roleDesc>Poet , your proof ——</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>King , the greatest things in the world disdain proof . But if you could for a time wipe out all the poets and all their poetry from the world , then you would soon discover , by their very absence , where the men of action got their energy from , and who really supplied the life-sap to their harvest-field . It is not those who have plunged deep down into the Pundit 's Ocean of Renunciation , nor those who are always clinging to their possessions ; it is not those who have become adepts in turning out quantities of work , nor those who are ever telling the dry beads of duty ,— it is not these who win at last . But it is those who love , because they live . These truly win , for they truly surrender . They accept pain with all their strength and with all their strength they remove pain . It is they who create , because they know the secret of true joy , which is the secret of detachment</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Well then , Poet , if that be so , what do you ask me to do now ?</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>I ask you , King , to rise up and move . That cry outside yonder is the cry of life to life . And if the life within you is not stirred , in response to that call without , then there is cause for anxiety indeed ,— not because duty has been neglected , but because you are dying</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>But , Poet , surely we must die , sooner or later ?</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>No , King , that 's a lie . When we feel for certain that we are alive , then we know for certain that we shall go on living . Those who have never put life to the test , in all possible ways , these keep on crying out :</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Life is fleeting , Life is waning ,</role>
     <roleDesc>Life is like a dew-drop on a lotus leaf</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>But</role>
     <roleDesc>is n't life inconstant ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Only because its movement is unceasing . The moment you stop this movement</role>
     <roleDesc>that moment you begin to play the drama of Death</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Poet</role>
     <roleDesc>are you speaking the truth ? Shall we really go on living ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Yes</role>
     <roleDesc>we shall really go on living</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Then , Poet , if we are going to go on living , we must make our life worth its eternity . Is not that so ?</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Yes</role>
     <roleDesc>indeed</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Ho</role>
     <roleDesc>Guard</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Yes</role>
     <roleDesc>Your Royal Highness</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Call the Vizier at once</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Yes , Your Royal Highness</role>
     <roleDesc>Vizier enters</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>What is Your Majesty 's pleasure ?</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Vizier ! Why on earth have you kept me waiting so long ?</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>I was very busy</role>
     <roleDesc>Your Majesty</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Busy ? What were you busy about ?</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>I was dismissing the General</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Why should you dismiss the General ? We have got to discuss war matters with him</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>And arrangements had to be made for the state-departure of the Chinese Ambassador</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>What do you mean by his state-departure ?</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>If it please Your Majesty</role>
     <roleDesc>you did not grant him an interview . So he ——</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Vizier ! You surprise me . Is this the way you manage state affairs ? What has happened to you ? Have you lost your senses ?</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Then , again . Sire , I was trying to find a way to pull down the Poet 's house . At first , no one would undertake it . Then , at last , all the Pundits of the Royal School of Grammar and Logic came up with their proper tools and set to work</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Vizier ! Are you mad this morning ? Pull down the Poet 's house ? Why</role>
     <roleDesc>you might as well kill all the birds in the garden and make them up into a pie</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>If it please Your Majesty</role>
     <roleDesc>you need not be annoyed . We sha n't have to pull down the house after all ; for the moment Sruti-bhushan heard it was to be demolished , he decided to take possession of it himself</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>What , Vizier ! That 's worse still . Why ! The Goddess of Music would break her harp in pieces against my head , if she even heard of such a thing . No , that can n't be</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Then</role>
     <roleDesc>Your Majesty , there was another thing to be got through . We had to deliver over the province of Kanchanpur to the Pundit</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>No</role>
     <roleDesc>Vizier ! What a mess you are making . That must go to our Poet</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>To me</role>
     <roleDesc>King ? No . My poetry never accepts reward</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Well</role>
     <roleDesc>well . Let the Pundit have it</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>And</role>
     <roleDesc>last of all , Sire . I have issued orders to the soldiers to disperse the crowd of famine-stricken people</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Vizier , you are doing nothing but blunder . The best way to disperse the famished people is with food , not force</role>
     <roleDesc>Guard enters</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>May it please Your Royal Highness</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>What 's the matter</role>
     <roleDesc>Guard ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>May it please Your Royal Highness , here is Sruti-bhushan , the Pundit , coming back with his Book of Devotions</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Oh , stop him , Vizier , stop him . He will undo everything . Do n't let him come upon me unawares like this . In a moment of weakness , I may suddenly find myself out of my depths in the Ocean of Renunciation . Poet ! Do n't give me time for that . Do something . Do anything . Have you got anything ready to hand ? Any play toward ? Any poem ? Any masque ? Any ——</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Yes , King . I have got the very thing . But whether it is a drama , or a poem , or a play , or a masque , I cannot say</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Shall I be able to understand the sense of what you have written ?</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>No</role>
     <roleDesc>King , what a poet writes is not meant to have any sense</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>What then ?</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>To have the tune itself</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>What do you mean ? Is there no philosophy in it ?</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>No</role>
     <roleDesc>none at all , thank goodness</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>What does it say</role>
     <roleDesc>then ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>King , it says “ I exist . ” Do n't you know the meaning of the first cry of the new-born child ? The child , when it is born , hears at once the cries of the earth and water and sky , which surround him ,— and they all cry to him , “ We exist , ” and his tiny little heart responds , and cries out in its turn , “ I exist . ” My poetry is like the cry of that new-born child . It is a response to the cry of the Universe</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Is it nothing more than that</role>
     <roleDesc>Poet ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>No , nothing more . There is life in my song , which cries , “ In joy and in sorrow , in work and in rest , in life and in death , in victory and in defeat , in this world and in the next , all hail to the ‘ I exist . ’ ”</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Well , Poet , I can assure you , if your play has n't got any philosophy in it , it wo n't pass muster in these days</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>That 's true , King . The newer people , of this modern age , are more eager to amass than to realize . They are , in their generation , wiser than the children of light</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Whom shall we ask</role>
     <roleDesc>then , for an audience ? Shall we ask the young students of our royal school ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>No</role>
     <roleDesc>King , they cut up poetry with their logic . They are like the young-horned deer trying their new horns on the flower-beds</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Whom should I ask</role>
     <roleDesc>then ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Ask those whose hair is turning grey</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>What do you mean</role>
     <roleDesc>Poet ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>The youth of these middle-aged people is a youth of detachment . They have just crossed the waters of pleasure</role>
     <roleDesc>and are in sight of the land of pure gladness . They do n't want to eat fruit , but to produce it</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>I , at least , have now reached that age of discretion , and ought to be able to appreciate your songs . Shall I ask the General ?</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Yes</role>
     <roleDesc>ask him</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>And the Chinese Ambassador ?</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Yes</role>
     <roleDesc>ask him too</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>I hear my father-in-law has come</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Well</role>
     <roleDesc>ask him too , but I have my doubts about his youthful sons</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>But do n't forget his daughter</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Do n't worry about her . She wo n't let herself be forgotten</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>And Sruti-bhushan ? Shall I ask him ?</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>No , King , no . Decidedly , no . I have no grudge against him . Why should I inflict this on him ?</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Very well</role>
     <roleDesc>Poet . Off with you . Make your stage preparations</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>No</role>
     <roleDesc>King . We are going to act this play without any special preparations . Truth looks tawdry when she is overdressed</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>But</role>
     <roleDesc>Poet , there must be some canvas for a background</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>No . Our only background is the mind . On that we shall summon up a picture with the magic wand of music</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Are there any songs in the play ?</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Yes</role>
     <roleDesc>King . The door of each act will be opened by the key of song</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>What is the subject of the songs ?</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>The Disrobing of Winter</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>But</role>
     <roleDesc>Poet , we have n't read about that in any Mythology</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>In the world-myth this song comes round in its turn . In the play of the seasons , each year , the mask of the Old Man , Winter , is pulled off , and the form of Spring is revealed in all its beauty . Thus we see that the old is ever new</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Well</role>
     <roleDesc>Poet , so much for the songs : but what about the remainder ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Oh</role>
     <roleDesc>that is all about life</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Life ? What is life ?</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>This is how it runs : A band of young companions has run off in pursuit of one Old Man . They have taken a vow to catch him . They enter into a cave ; they take hold of him</role>
     <roleDesc>and then ——</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Then</role>
     <roleDesc>what ? What did they see ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Ah . That will be told in its own good time</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>But , I have n't understood one thing . Your drama and your songs ,— have they different subjects , or the same ?</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>The same</role>
     <roleDesc>King . The play of Spring in nature is the counterpart of the play of Youth in our lives . It is simply from the lyrical drama of the World Poet that I have stolen this plot</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Who</role>
     <roleDesc>then , are the chief characters ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>One is called the Leader</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Who is he</role>
     <roleDesc>Poet ?</roleDesc>

     <item>The purple secondary curtain<span type="note_anchor">[ 1 ]</span>goes up , disclosing the elevated rear stage with a skyey background of dark blue , on which appear the horn of the crescent moon and the silver points of stars . Trees in the foreground , with two rope swings entwined with garlands of flowers . Flowers everywhere in profusion . On the extreme left the mouth of a dark cavern dimly seen . Boys representing the “ Bamboo ” disclosed , swinging .</item>

    <p>[ Footnote 1 : Neither the secondary curtain nor the drop is again used during the play . The action is continuous , either on the front stage , or on the rear stage , the latter being darkened when not actually in use . ] SONG OF THE BAMBOO O South Wind , the Wanderer , come and rock me , Rouse me into the rapture of new leaves . I am the wayside bamboo tree , waiting for your breath To tingle life into my branches . O South Wind , the Wanderer , my dwelling is in the end of the lane . I know your wayfaring , and the language of your footsteps . Your least touch thrills me out of my slumber , Your whisper gleans my secrets . ( Enter a troop of girls , dancing , representing birds . ) SONG OF THE BIRD The sky pours its light into our hearts , We fill the sky with songs in answer . We pelt the air with our notes When the air stirs our wings with its madness . O Flame of the Forest , All your flower-torches are ablaze ; You have kissed our songs red with the passion of your youth . In the spring breeze the mango-blossoms launch their messages to the unknown And the new leaves dream aloud all day . O Sirish , you have cast your perfume-net round our hearts , Drawing them out in songs . ( Disclosed among the branches of trees , suddenly lighted up , boys representing champak blossoms . ) SONG OF THE BLOSSOMING CHAMPAK My shadow dances in your waves , everflowing river , I , the blossoming champak , stand unmoved on the bank , with my flower-vigils . My movement dwells in the stillness of my depth , In the delicious birth of new leaves , In flood of flowers , In unseen urge of new life towards the light . Its stirring thrills the sky , and the silence of the dawn is moved . Morning [ The rear stage is now darkened . On the main stage , bright , enter a band of youths whose number may be anything between three and thirty . They sing . ] The fire of April leaps from forest to forest , Flashing up in leaves and flowers from all nooks and corners . The sky is thriftless with colours , The air delirious with songs . The wind-tost branches of the woodland Spread their unrest in our blood . The air is filled with bewilderment of mirth ; And the breeze rushes from flower to flower , asking their names . [ In the following dialogue only the names of the principal characters are given . Wherever the name is not given the speaker is one or other of the Youths . ] April pulls hard , brother , April pulls very hard . How do you know that ? If he did n't , he would never have pulled Dada outside his den . Well , I declare . Here is Dada , our cargo-boat of moral-maxims , towed against the current of his own pen and ink . Chandra But you must n't give April all the credit for that . For I , Chandra , have hidden the yellow leaves of his manuscript book among the young buds of the pial forest , and Dada is out looking for it . The manuscript book banished ! What a good riddance ! We ought to strip off Dada 's grey philosopher 's cloak also . Chandra Yes , the very dust of the earth is tingling with youth , and yet there 's not a single touch of Spring in the whole of Dada 's body . Dada Oh , do stop this fooling . What a nuisance you are making of yourselves ! We are n't children any longer . Chandra Dada , the age of this earth is scarcely less than yours ; and yet it is not ashamed to look fresh . Dada , you are always struggling with those quatrains of yours , full of advice that is as old as death , while the earth and the water are ever striving to be new . Dada , how in the world can you go on writing verses like that , sitting in your den ? Dada Well , you see , I do n't cultivate poetry , as an amateur gardener cultivates flowers . My poems have substance and weight in them . Yes , they are like the turnips , which cling to the ground . Dada Well , then , listen to me —— How awful ! Here 's Dada going to run amuck with his quatrains . Oh dear , oh dear ! The quatrains are let loose . There 's no holding them in . To all passers-by I give notice that Dada 's quatrains have gone mad , and are running amuck . Chandra Dada ! Do n't take any notice of their fun . Go on with your reading . If no one else can survive it , I think I can . I am not a coward like these fellows . Come on , then , Dada . We wo n't be cowards . We will keep our ground , and not yield an inch , but only listen . We will receive the spear-thrusts of the quatrains on our breast , not on our back . But for pity 's sake , Dada , give us only one — not more . Dada Very well . Now listen : If bamboos were made only into flutes , They would droop and die with very shame , They hold their heads high in the sky , Because they are variously useful . Please , gentlemen , do n't laugh . Have patience while I explain . The meaning is —— The meaning ? What ? Must the infantry charge of meaning follow the cannonading of your quatrains , to complete the rout ? Dada Just one word to make you understand . It means , that if the bamboos were no better than those noisy instruments —— No , Dada , we must not understand . I defy you to make us understand . Dada , if you use force to make us understand we shall use force to force ourselves not to understand . Dada The gist of the quatrain is this , that if we do no good to the world , then —— Then the world will be very greatly relieved . Dada There is another verse that makes it clearer : There are numerous stars in the midnight sky , Which hang in the air for no purpose ; If they would only come down to earth , For the street lighting they might be useful . I see we must make clearer our meaning . Catch him . Let 's raise him up , shoulder high , and take him back to his den . Dada Why are you so excited to-day ? Have you any particular business to do ? Yes , we have very urgent business ,— very urgent indeed . Dada What is your business about ? We are out to seek a play for our Spring festival . Dada Play ! Day and night , play ! ( They sing . ) We are free , my friends , from the fear of work , For we know that work is play ,— the play of life . It is Play , to fight and toss , between life and death ; It is Play that flashes in the laughter of light in the infinite heart ; It roars in the wind , and surges in the sea . Oh , here comes our Leader . Brothers — our Leader , our Leader . Leader Hallo ! What a noise you make ! Was it that which made you come out of doors ? Leader Yes . Well , we did it for that very purpose . Leader You do n't want me to remain indoors ? Why remain indoors ? This outer world has been made with a lavish expenditure of sun and moon and stars . Let us enjoy it , and then we can save God 's face for indulging in such extravagance . Leader What were you discussing ? This : ( They sing . ) Play blooms in flower and ripens in fruit In the sunshine of eternal youth . Play bursts up in the blood-red fire , and licks into ashes the decaying and the dead . Our Dada 's objection was about this play . Dada Shall I tell you the reason why ? Yes , Dada , you may tell us , but we sha n't promise to listen . Dada Here it is : Time is the capital of work , And Play is its defalcation . Play rifles the house , and then wastes its spoil , Therefore the wise call it worse than useless . Chandra But surely , Dada , you are talking nonsense . Time itself is Play . Its only object is Pas-time . Dada Then what is Work ? Chandra Work is the dust raised by the passing of Time . Dada Leader , you must give us your answers . Leader No . I never give answers . I lead on from one question to another . That is my leadership . Dada Everything else has its limits , but your childishness is absolutely unbounded . Do you know the reason ? It is because we are really nothing but children . And everything else has its limitations except the child . Dada Wo n't you ever attain Age ? No , we shall never attain Age . We shall die old , but never attain Age . Chandra When we meet Age , we shall shave his head , and put him on a donkey , and send him across the river . Oh , you can save yourself the trouble of shaving his head for Age is bald . ( They sing . ) Our hair shall never turn grey , Never . There is no blank in this world for us , no break in our road , It may be an illusion that we follow , But it shall never play us false , Never . ( The Leader sings . ) Our hair shall never turn grey , Never . We will never doubt the world and shut our eyes to ponder . Never . We will not grope in the maze of our mind . We flow with the flood of things , from the mountain to the sea , We will never be lost in the desert sand , Never . We can tell , by his looks , that Dada will some day go to that Old Man , to receive his lessons . Leader Which Old Man ? The Old Man of the line of Adam . He dwells in a cave , and never thinks of dying . Leader Where did you learn about him ? Oh , every one talks about him , And it is in the books also . Leader What does he look like ? Some say he is white , like the skull of a dead man . And some say he is dark , like the socket of a skeleton 's eye . But have n't you heard any news of him , Leader ? Leader I do n't believe in him at all . Well , that goes entirely against current opinion . That Old Man is more existent than anything else . He lives within the ribs of creation . According to our Pundit , it is we who have no existence . You can n't be certain whether we are , or are not . Chandra We ? Oh , we are too brand new altogether . We have n't yet got our credentials to prove that we exist . Leader Have you really gone and opened communication with the Pundits ? Why ? What harm is there in that , Leader ? Leader You will become pale , like the white mist in autumn . Even the least colour of blood will disappear from your mind . I have a suggestion . What , Leader ? What ? Leader You were looking out for a play ? Yes , yes , we got quite frantic about it . We thought it over so vigorously , that people had to run to the King 's court to lodge a complaint . Leader Well , I can suggest a play which will be new . What ?— What ?— Tell us . Leader Go and capture the Old Man . That is new , no doubt , but we very much doubt if it 's a play . Leader I am sure you wo n't be able to do it . Not do it ? We shall . Leader No , never . Well then , suppose we do capture him , what will you give us ? Leader I shall accept you as my preceptor . Preceptor ! You want to make us grey , and cold , and old , before our time . Leader Then , what do you want me to do ? If we capture him , then we shall take away your leadership . Leader That will be a great relief to me . You have made all my bones out of joint already . Very well , then it 's all settled ?</p>
   </set>
   <titlePage>
    <docTitle><titlePart>Yes , settled . We shall bring him to you by the next full moon of Spring . But what are we going to do with him ? Leader You shall let him join in your Spring Festival . Oh no , that will be outrageous . Then the mango flowers will run to seed at once . And all the cuckoos will become owls . And the bees will go about reciting Sanskrit verses , making the air hum with m 's and n 's . Leader And your skull will be so top-heavy with prudence , that it will be difficult for you to keep on your feet . How awful ! Leader And you will have rheumatics in all your joints . How awful ! Leader And you will become your own elder brothers , pulling your own ears to set yourselves right . How awful ! Leader And —— No more “ ands . ” We are ready to surrender . We will abandon our game of capturing the Old Man . We will put it off till the cold weather . In this Springtime , your company will be enough for us . Leader Ah , I see ! You have already got the chill of the Old Man in your bones . Why ? What are the symptoms ? Leader You have no enthusiasm . You back out at the very start . Why do n't you make a trial ? Very well . Agreed . Come on . Let us go after the Old Man . We will pluck him out , like a grey hair , wherever we find him . Leader But the Old Man is an adept in the business of plucking out . His best weapon is the hoe . You need n't try to frighten us like that . When we are out for adventure , we must leave behind all fears , all quatrains , all Pundits , and all Scriptures . ( They sing . ) We are out on our way And we fear not the Robber , the Old Man . Our path is straight , it is broad , Our burden is light , for our pocket is bare , Who can rob us of our folly ? For us there is no rest , nor ease , nor praise , nor success , We dance in the measure of fortune 's rise and fall , We play our game , or win or lose , And we fear not the Robber .</titlePart></docTitle>

     <p><stage>Spring 's Heralds try to rob Winter of his outfit of age .</stage>Rear stage lighted up , disclosing Old Winter teased by the boys and girls representing Spring 's Heralds . SONG OF THE HERALDS OF SPRING We seek our playmates , Waking them up from all corners before it is morning . We call them in bird songs , Beckon them in nodding branches . We spread our spell for them in the splendour of clouds . We laugh at solemn Death Till he joins in our laughter . We tear open Time 's purse , Taking back his plunder from him . You shall lose your heart to us , O Winter . It will gleam in the trembling leaves And break into flowers .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>SONG OF WINTER</speaker>
     <p>Leave me , let me go . I sail for the bleak North , for the peace of the frozen shore . Your laughter is untimely , my friends . You turn my farewell tunes into the welcome song of the Newcomer , And all things draw me back again into the dancing ring of their hearts . SONG OF THE HERALDS OF SPRING Life 's spies are we , lurking in ambush everywhere . We wait to rob you of your last savings of withered hours to scatter them in the wayward winds . We shall bind you in flower chains where Spring keeps his captives , For we know you carry your jewels of youth hidden in your grey rags .<stage>Noon</stage><stage>The rear stage is darkened . The band of Youths enters on the main stage . No actual change in the scenery is necessary — this being left to the imagination of the audience .</stage>Ferryman ! Ferryman ! Open your door .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Ferryman</speaker>
     <p>For your Spring Festival ? Are you become mad ? Not a sudden becoming . We have been like this from the beginning .

The March wind , seized with frenzy , Runs and reels , and sways with noisy branches . The sun and stars are drawn in the whirl of rapture . Now , Ferryman , give us news of the Old Man . You ply your boat from one landing stage to another . Surely you know where ——</p>

     <p>My business is limited only to the path . But whose path it is , and what it means , I have no occasion to enquire . For my goal is the landing-stage , not the house . Very well . Let us go , let us try all the ways .<stage>They sing .</stage>The Piper pipes in the centre , hidden from sight . Ah , the turbulent tune , to whose time the oceans dance , And dance our heaving hearts . Fling away all burdens and cares , brother , Do not be doubtful of your path , For the path wakes up of itself Under the dancing steps of freedom .</p>

     <speaker>Ferryman</speaker>
     <p>There comes the Watchman . Ask him . I know about the way ; but he knows about the wayfarers .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Watchman</speaker>
     <p>How absurd ! While you are seeking him , he is after you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Why ?</speaker>
     <p>Watchman He is fond of warming his cold blood with the wine of hot youth . We 'll give him a warm enough reception . All we want is to see him . Have you seen him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Watchman</speaker>
     <p>My watch is at night . I see my people , but do n't know their features . But , look here , every one knows that he is the great kidnapper ; and you want to kidnap him ! It 's midsummer madness . The secret is out . It does n't take long to discover that we are mad .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Watchman</speaker>
     <p>I am the Watchman . The people I see passing along the road are all very much alike . Therefore , when I see anything queer , it always strikes me . Just listen to him . All the respectable people of our neighbourhood say just the same thing — that we are queer . Yes , we 're queer . There 's no mistake about that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Watchman</speaker>
     <p>But all this is utter childishness . Do you hear that ? It 's exactly what our Dada says . We have been going on with our childishness through unremembered ages . And now we have become confirmed children . And we have a leader , who is a perfect veteran in childhood . He rushes along so recklessly , that he drops off his age at every step he runs .</p>

     <speaker>Watchman</speaker>

      <l>We move and move without rest ,</l>
      <l>We move while the wanderers ’ stars shine in the sky and fade .</l>

     <p>Is it your custom to answer questions by songs ?</p>

     <p>Yes , otherwise the answer becomes too unintelligible .</p>

     <p>I do n't quite understand you .</p>

     <p>No , no . There 's no need to do that . I do n't hope to understand you any better , even if you do sing .</p>

     <p>Everybody has given up the hope of understanding us .</p>

     <p>But how can things get on with you , if you behave like this ?</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Oh , there 's no need for things to get on with us , so long as we ourselves get on .</p>

     <p>Mad ! Quite mad ! Raving mad !</p>

     <p>Why , here comes our Dada . Dada , what made you lag behind ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Chandra</speaker>
     <p>Do n't you know ? We are free as the wind , because we have no substance in us . But Dada is like the rain-cloud of August . He must stop , every now and then , to unburden himself .</p>

     <p>I am delighted to see you . I want to read you something that I have written . It contains nothing frivolous , but only the most important lessons .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Ferryman</speaker>
     <p>Very good . Let us have it then .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Watchman</speaker>
     <p>Our master used to tell us that there are plenty of men to say good things , but very few to listen . That requires strength of mind . Now , go on , Sir , go on .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dada</speaker>
     <p>I saw , in the street , one of the King 's officers dragging along a merchant . The King had made up a false charge , in order to get his money . This gave me an inspiration . You must know that I never write a single line which is not inspired by some actual fact . You can put my verses to the test in the open streets and markets ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Ferryman</speaker>
     <p>Please , Sir , do let us hear what you have written .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Dada</speaker>
     <p>The sugar-cane filling itself with juice Is chewed and sucked dry by all beggars . O foolish men , take your lesson from this ; Those trees are saved , which are fruitful . You will understand that the sugar-cane gets into trouble , simply because it tries to keep its juice . But nobody is so foolish as to kill the tree that freely gives fruit .</p>

     <p>Yes , Watchman , it contains great lessons for us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Watchman</speaker>
     <p>It gives me food for thought . If only I had here our neighbour , the Scribe ! I should like to take this down . Do send round to tell the people of the place to assemble .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Chandra</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>But , Ferryman , you promised to come out with us . Yet , if once</l>
      <l>Dada begins to quote his quatrains , there will be ——</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Ferryman</speaker>
     <p>Go along with you . None of your madness here . We are fortunate now in having met our master . Let us improve the occasion with good words . We are all of us getting old . Who knows when we shall die ? All the more reason why you should cultivate our company .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Chandra</speaker>
     <p>You can always find another Dada . But when once we are dead , God will never repeat the blunder of another absurdity like us again .</p>

     <p>Who is there ? Is that the Oilman ?</p>

     <p>By whom ?</p>

     <speaker>Oilman</speaker>
     <p>Yes , Sirs , the Old Man ; what makes you so glad ? Oh , that 's a bad habit of ours . We become glad for no reason whatever .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Watchman</speaker>
     <p><stage>Aside .</stage>Mad ! Raving mad ! Have you seen the Old Man ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>Oilman</speaker>
     <p>I think I saw him in the distance last night .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>First Youth</speaker>
     <p>What did he look like ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Oilman</speaker>
     <p>Black . More black than our brother here , the Watchman . Black as night , with two eyes on his breast shining like two glow-worms . That wo n't suit us . That would be awkward for our Spring Festival .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Chandra</speaker>
     <p>We shall have to change our date from the full moon to the dark moon . For the dark moon has no end of eyes on her breast .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Watchman</speaker>
     <p>But I warn you , my friends , you are not doing wisely .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>No , we are not</speaker>
     <p>We are found out again . We never do anything wisely . It is contrary to our habit .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Watchman</speaker>
     <p>Do you take this to be a joke ? I warn you , my friends , it is dangerous . Dangerous ? That 's the best joke of all .<stage>They sing .</stage>We are neither too good nor wise , That is all the merit we have . Our calumny spreads from land to land , And danger dogs our steps . We take great care to forget what is taught us , We say things different from the book , Bringing upon us trouble , And rebuke from the learned .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Watchman</speaker>
     <p>Ah , Sir , you spoke about some Leader . Where is he ? He could have kept you in order , if he were with you . He never stays with us , lest he should have to keep us in order . He simply launches us on our way , and then slips off .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Watchman</speaker>
     <p>That 's a poor idea of leadership .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Chandra</speaker>
     <p>He is never concerned about his leadership . That is why we recognize him as our Leader .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Watchman</speaker>
     <p>Then he has got a very easy task .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Chandra</speaker>
     <p>It is no easy task to lead men . But it is easy enough to drive them .<stage>They sing .</stage>We are not too good nor wise , That is all the merit we have . In a luckless moment we were born , When the star of wisdom was the dimmest . We can hope for no profit from our adventures , We move on , because we must . Dada , come on . Let us go .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Watchman</speaker>
     <p>No , no , Sir . Do n't you get yourself into mischief in their company .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Ferryman</speaker>
     <p>You read your verses , Sir , to us . Our neighbours will be here soon . They will be greatly profited .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dada</speaker>
     <p>No . I 'm not going to move a step from here . Then let us move . The men in the street can n't bear us . That 's because we rattle them too much . You hear the hum of human bees , they smell the honey of Dada 's quatrains .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>Villager</speaker>
     <p>Is it true that there is going to be a reading ? Who are you ? Are you going to read ? No . We commit all kinds of atrocities , but not that . This one merit will bring us salvation .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Villager</speaker>
     <p>What do they say ? They seem to be talking in riddles .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Chandra</speaker>
     <p>We only say things which we perfectly understand ourselves , and they are riddles to you . Dada repeats to you things which you understand perfectly and these sound to you the very essence of wisdom .</p>

     <speaker>SONG-PRELUDE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Winter is being unmasked — his hidden youth about to be disclosed .</stage>The rear stage lighted up , disclosing Winter and the Heralds of Spring . SONG OF THE HERALDS OF SPRING How grave he looks , how laughably old , How solemnly quiet among death preparations ! Come , friends , help him to find himself before he reaches home . Change his pilgrim 's robe into the dress of the singing youth , Snatch away his bag of dead things And confound his calculations .<stage>Another group sings .</stage>The time comes when the world shall know that you 're not banished in your own shadows ; Your heart shall burst in torrents Out of the clasp of the ice ; And your North wind turn its face Against the haunts of the flitting phantoms . There sounds the magician 's drum , And the sun waits with laughter in his glance , To see your grey turn into green .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Evening</stage>
    <stage>The rear stage is darkened ; the light on the main stage dimmed to the greyness of dark .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Band of Youths</speaker>
     <p>They all cry , “ There , there , ” and when we look for it , we find nothing but dust and dry leaves . I thought I had a glimpse of the flag on his car through the cloud . It is difficult to follow his track . Now it seems East : now it seems West . And so we are tired , chasing shadows all day long . And the day has been lost . I tell you the truth . Fear comes more and more into my mind , as the day passes . We have made a mistake . The morning light whispered in our ears , “ Bravo , march on . ” And now , the evening light is mocking us for that . I am afraid we have been deceived . I am beginning to feel greater respect for Dada 's quatrains than before . We shall all be soon sitting down on the ground composing quatrains . And then the whole neighbourhood will come , swarming round us . And they will get such immense benefit from our wisdom that they will never leave us . And we shall settle down like a great big boulder , cold and immovable . And they will cling to us , as we sit there , like a thick fog . What would our Leader think of us , I wonder , if he could hear us now ? I am sure it is our Leader , who has led us astray . He makes us toil for nothing , while he himself remains idle . Let us go back and fight with him . We will tell him that we wo n't move a step further , but sit with our legs tucked under us . These legs are wretched vagabonds . They are always trudging the road . We will keep our hands fast behind our backs . There is no mischief in the back ; all the trouble is in the front . Of all our limbs , the back is the most truthful . It says to us , “ Lie down . ” When we are young , that braggart breast is a great swell ; but , in the end , we can only rely on our back . The little stream that flows past our village comes to my mind . That morning we thought that it said to us , “ Forward ! Forward ! ” But what it really said was , “ False ! False ! ” The world is all false . Our Pundit used to tell us that . We shall go straight to the Pundit , when we get back . We shall never stir one step outside the limit of the Pundit 's Scriptures . What a mistake we made . We thought that moving itself was something heroic . But really not to move , that is heroic , because it is defying the whole moving world . Brave rebels that we are , we shall not move . We shall have the audacity to sit still , and never move an inch . “ Life and youth are fleeting , ” the Scripture says . Let life and youth go to the dogs , we shall not move . “ Our minds and wealth are fleeting , ” adds the Scripture . “ Give them up and sit still , ” say we . Let us go back to the point from which we started . But that would be to move .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>What then ?</speaker>
     <p>There sit down , where we have come to . And let us imagine that there we had been before we ever came there . Yes , yes , that will keep our minds still . If we know that we have come from somewhere else , then the mind longs for that somewhere else . That land of somewhere else is a very dangerous place . There the ground moves , and also the roads . But as for us ——<stage>They sing .</stage>We cling to our seats and never stir , We allow our flowers to fade in peace , and avoid the trouble of bearing fruit . Let the starlights blazon their eternal folly , We quench our flames . Let the forest rustle and the ocean roar , We sit mute . Let the call of the flood-tide come from the sea , We remain still . Do you hear that laughter ? Yes , yes , it is laughter . What a relief ! We have never heard that sound for an age . We had been choking , for want of the breath of laughter . This laughter comes to us like the April rain .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Whose is it ?</speaker>
     <p>Cannot you guess ? It is our Chandra . What a marvellous gift of laughter he has ! It is like a waterfall . It dashes all the black stones out of the path . It is like sunlight . It cuts the mist to pieces with its sword . Now all danger of quatrain fever is over . Let us get up . From this moment there will be nothing but work for us . As the Scripture says , “ Everything in this world is fleeting , and he only lives who does his duty and achieves fame . ” Why are you quoting that ? Are you still suffering from the quatrain fever ? What do you mean by fame ? Does the river take any heed of its foam ? Fame is that foam on life 's stream .<stage>Enter Chandra with a blind Minstrel .</stage>Well , Chandra , what makes you so glad ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Chandra</speaker>
     <p>I have got the track of the Old Man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>From whom ?</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Chandra</l>
      <l>From this old Minstrel .</l>

     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Chandra</speaker>
     <p>Yes , that is why he has not got to seek the road . What do you say ? Shall you be able to lead us right ?</p>

     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>But how ?</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Minstrel</l>
      <l>Because I can hear the footsteps .</l>

     <p>They all started up with fear , when I asked about the Old Man . Only this Minstrel seemed to have no fear . I suppose because he cannot see , he is not afraid .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Minstrel</speaker>
     <p>Do you know why I have no fear ? When the sun of my life set , and I became blind , the dark night revealed all its lights , and , from that day forward , I have been no more afraid of the dark . Then let us go . The evening star is up .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Minstrel</speaker>
     <p>Let me sing , and walk on as I sing , and you follow me . I cannot find my way , if I do not sing . What do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Minstrel</speaker>
     <p>My songs precede , I follow .<stage>He sings .</stage>Gently , my friend , gently walk to your silent chamber . I know not the way , I have not the light , Dark is my life and my world . I have only the sound of your steps to guide me in this wilderness . Gently , my friend , gently walk along the dark shore . Let the hint of the way come in whisper , Through the night , in the April breeze . I have only the scent of your garland to guide me in this wilderness .</p>

     <speaker>SONG-PRELUDE</speaker>
     <p><stage>There enter a troupe of young things , and they introduce themselves in a song as follows :</stage>THE SONG OF RETURNING YOUTH Again and again we say “ Good-bye , ” To come back again and again . Oh , who are you ? I am the flower vakul . And who are you ? I am the flower parul . And who are these ? We are mango blossoms landed on the shore of light . We laugh and take leave when the time beckons us . We rush into the arms of the ever-returning . But who are you ? I am the flower shimul . And who are you ? I am the kamini bunch , And who are these ? We are the jostling crowd of new leaves .<stage>Winter is revealed as Spring and answers to the questions put by the chorus of young things .</stage>THE SONG OF BURDENS DROPPED Do you own defeat at the hand of youth ? Yes . Have you met at last the ageless Old , who ever grows new ? Yes . Have you come out of the walls that crumble and bury those whom they shelter ? Yes .<stage>Another group sings .</stage>Do you own defeat at the hands of life ? Yes . Have you passed through death to stand at last face to face with the Deathless ? Yes . Have you dealt the blow to the demon dust , that swallows your city Immortal ? Yes .<stage>Spring 's flowers surround him and sing .</stage>THE SONG OF FRESH BEAUTY We waited by the wayside counting moments till you appeared in the April morning . You come as a soldier-boy winning life at death 's gate ,— Oh , the wonder of it . We listen amazed at the music of your young voice . Your mantle is blown in the wind like the fragrance of the Spring . The white spray of malati flowers in your hair shines like star-clusters . A fire burns through the veil of your smile ,— Oh , the wonder of it . And who knows where your arrows are hidden which smite death ?<stage>Night</stage><stage>The rear stage is darkened , and the light on the main stage dimmed to the heavy purple blackness of mourning .</stage><stage>Enter the Band of Youths .</stage>Chandra has gone away again , leaving us behind . It is difficult to keep him still . We get our rest by sitting down , but he gets his by walking on . He has gone across the river with the blind minstrel , in whose depth of blindness Chandra is seeking the invisible light . That is why our Leader calls him the Diver . Our life becomes utterly empty , when Chandra is away . Do you feel as though something was in the air ? The sky seems to be looking into our face , like a friend bidding farewell . This little stream of water is trickling through the casuarina grove . It seems like the tears of midnight . We have never gazed upon the earth before with such intentness . When we run forward at full speed , our eyes keep gazing in front of us , and we see nothing on either side of us . If things did not move on and vanish , we should see no beauty anywhere . If youth had only the heat of movement , it would get parched and withered . But there is ever the hidden tear , which keeps it fresh . The cry of the world is not only “ I have , ” but also “ I give . ” In the first dawning light of creation , “ I have ” was wedded to “ I give . ” If this bond of union were to snap , then everything would go to ruin . I do n't know where that blind Minstrel has landed us at last . It seems as though these stars in the sky above us are the gazing of countless eyes we met in all forgotten ages . It seems as if , through the flowers , there came the whisper of those we have forgotten , saying Remember us . Our hearts will break if we do not sing .<stage>They sing .</stage>Did you leave behind you your love , my heart , and miss peace through all your days ? And is the path you followed lost and forgotten , making your return hopeless ? I go roaming listening to brooks ’ babble , to the rustle of leaves . And it seems to me that I shall find the way , that reaches the land of lost love beyond the evening stars . What a strange tune is this , that comes out of the music of Spring . It seems like the tune of yellow leaves . Spring has stored up its tears in secret for us all this while . It was afraid we should not understand it , because we were so youthful . It wanted to beguile us with smiles . But we shall sleep our hearts tonight in the sadness of the other shore . Ah , the dear earth ! The beautiful earth ! She wants all that we have — the touch of our hands , the song of our hearts . She wants to draw out from us all that is within , hidden even from ourselves . This is her sorrow , that she finds out some things only to know that she has not found all . She loses before she attains . Ah , the dear earth ! We shall never deceive you .<stage>They sing .</stage>I shall crown you with my garland , before I take leave . You ever spoke to me in all my joys and sorrows . And now , at the end of the day , my own heart will break in speech . Words came to me , but not the tune , and the song that I never sang to you remains hidden behind my tears . Brother , did you notice that some one seemed to have passed by ? The only thing you feel is this passing by . I felt the touch of the mantle of some wayfarer . We came out to capture somebody , but now we feel the longing to be captured ourselves . Ah , here comes the Minstrel . Where have you brought us ? The breath of the wayfaring world touches us here ,— the breath of the starry sky . We came seeking a new form of play . But now we have forgotten what play it was . We wanted to catch the Old Man . And everybody said that he was terrifying , a bodiless head , a gaping mouth , a dragon eager to swallow the moon of the youth of the world . But now we are no longer afraid . The flowers go , the leaves go , the waves in the river go , and we shall also follow them . Ah , blind Minstrel , strike your lute and sing to us . Who knows what is the hour of the night ?<stage>The Minstrel sings .</stage>Let me give my all to him , before I am asked , whom the world offers its all . When I came to him for my gifts , I was not afraid ; And I will not fear , when I come to him , to give up what I have . The morning accepts his gold with songs , the evening pays him back the debt of gold and is glad . The joy of the blooming flower comes to fruit with shedding of its leaves . Hasten , my heart , and spend yourself in love , before the day is done . Minstrel , why is Chandra still absent ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Minstrel</speaker>
     <p>Do n't you know that he has gone ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Gone ?— Where ?</speaker>

      <l>Minstrel</l>
      <l>He said , I shall go and conquer him .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Whom ?</speaker>
     <p>Minstrel The One who is feared by all . He said , “ Why else am I young ? ” Ah , that was fine .— Dada goes to read his quatrains to the village people , and Chandra has disappeared ,— for what purpose nobody knows .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Minstrel</speaker>
     <p>He said , “ Men have always been fighting for a cause . It is the shock of that , which ruffles the breeze of this Spring . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>The shock ?</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Minstrel</l>
      <l>Yes , the message that man 's fight is not yet over .</l>
      <l>Is this the message of Spring ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Minstrel</speaker>
     <p>Yes . Those , who have been made immortal by death , have sent their message in these fresh leaves of Spring . It said , “ We never doubted the way . We never counted the cost : we rushed out : we blossomed . If we had sat down to debate , then where would be the Spring ? ” Has that made Chandra mad ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Minstrel</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>He said ——</l>
      <stage>The Minstrel sings .</stage>
      <l>The Spring flowers have woven my wreath of victory ,</l>
      <l>The South wind breathes its breath of fire in my blood .</l>
      <l>The voice of the house-corner wails in vain from behind .</l>
      <l>Death stands before me , offering its crown .</l>
      <l>The tempest of youth sweeps the skyharp with its fingers ;</l>
      <l>My heart dances in its wild rhythm .</l>
      <l>Gathering and storing are not for me ,</l>
      <l>I spend and scatter .</l>
      <l>And prudence and comfort bid me adieu in despair .</l>
      <l>But where has he gone to ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Minstrel</speaker>
     <p>He said , “ I cannot keep waiting by the wayside any longer . I must go and meet him , and conquer him . ” But which way did he take ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Minstrel</speaker>
     <p>He has entered the cave . How is that ? It is so fearfully dark . Did he , without making any enquiries ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Minstrel</speaker>
     <p>Yes , he went in to make enquiries himself . When will he come back ? I do n't believe he will ever come back . But if Chandra leaves us , then life is not worth living . What shall we say to our Leader ? The Leader also will leave us . Did n't he leave any message for us before he disappeared ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Minstrel</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>He said , “ Wait for me . I shall return . ”</l>
      <l>Return ? How are we to know it ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Minstrel</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>He said , “ I will conquer , and then come back again . ”</l>
      <l>Then we shall wait for him all night .</l>
      <l>But , Minstrel , where have we got to wait for him ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Minstrel</speaker>
     <p>Before that cave , from whence the stream of water comes flowing out . Which way did he go to get there ? The darkness there is like a dark sword .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Minstrel</speaker>
     <p>He followed the sound of the night-bird 's wings . Why did you not go with him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Minstrel</speaker>
     <p>He left me behind to give you hope . When did he go ?</p>

     <p>In the first hour of the watch . Now the third hour has passed , I think . The air is chilly . I dreamt that three women , with their hair hanging loose —— Oh , leave off your dream-women . I am sick of your dreams . Everything appears darkly ominous . I did n't notice before the hooting of the owl . But now —— Do you hear that dog whining on the far bank of the river ? It seems as though a witch were riding upon him and lashing him . Surely , if it had been possible , Chandra would have come back by now . How I wish this night were over . Do you hear the woman 's cry ? Oh , the women , the women . They are ever crying and weeping . But they cannot turn those back , who must go forward . It is getting unbearable to sit still like this . Men imagine all sorts of things when they sit still . Let us go also . As soon as we are started on our way fear will leave us . But who will show us the way ? There is the blind Minstrel . What do you say , Minstrel ? Can you show us the way ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Minstrel</speaker>
     <p>Yes . But we can hardly believe you . How can you find out the path by simply singing ? If Chandra never comes back , you shall . We never knew that we loved Chandra so intensely . We made light of him all these days . When we are in the playing mood , we become so intent on the play , that we neglect the playmate . But , if he once comes back , we shall never neglect him any more . I am afraid that we have often given him pain . Yet his love rose above all that . We never knew how beautiful he was , when we could see him every day .<stage>They sing .</stage>When there was light in my world You stood outside my eyes . Now that there is none , You come into my heart . When there were dolls for me , I played ; You smiled and watched from the door . Now that the dolls have crumbled to dust , You come and sit by me . And I have only my heart for my music , When my lute-strings have broken . That Minstrel sits so still and silent . I do n't like it . He looks ominous ,— like the lowering autumn cloud . Let us dismiss him . No , no . It gives us heart , when he sits there . Do n't you see that there is no sign of fear in his face ? It seems as if some messages were striking his forehead . His body appears to espy some one in the distance . There seem to be eyes on the tips of his fingers . Simply by watching him , we can see that some one is coming through the dark . Look . He is standing up . He is turning towards the East , and making his obeisance . Yet there is nothing to be seen , not even a streak of light . Why not ask him what it is that he sees ? No , do n't disturb him . Do you know , it seems to me that the morning has dawned in him . As if the ferry-boat of light had reached the shore of his forehead . His mind is still , like the morning sky . The storm of birds ’ songs will burst out presently . He is striking his lute . His heart is singing . Hush . He is singing .<stage>The Minstrel sings .</stage>Victory to thee , victory for ever , O brave heart . Victory to life , to joy , to love , To eternal light . The night shall wane , the darkness shall vanish , Have faith , brave heart . Wake up from sleep , from languor of despair , Receive the light of new dawn with a song .<stage>A ray of light hovers before the cavern .</stage>Ah ! There he is . Chandra ! Chandra ! Hush . Do n't make any noise . I cannot see him distinctly . Ah ! It cannot be any other than Chandra .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Oh , what joy !</speaker>
     <p>Chandra ! Come ! Chandra ! How could you leave us for so long ? Have you been able to capture the Old Man ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Chandra</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I have . But we do n't see him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Chandra</speaker>
     <p>He is coming . But what did you see in the cave ? Tell us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Chandra</speaker>
     <p>No , I cannot tell you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Why ?</speaker>
     <p>Chandra If my mind were a voice , then I could tell you . But could you see him , whom you captured ? Was he the Old Man of the World ? The Old Man who would like to drink up the sea of youth in his insatiable thirst . Was it the One who is like the dark night , whose eyes are fixed on his breast , whose feet are turned the wrong way round , who walks backwards ? Was it the One who wears the garland of skulls , and lives in the burning-ground of the dead ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Chandra</speaker>
     <p>I do not know , I cannot say . But he is coming . You shall see him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Minstrel</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I see him .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The light strengthens and gradually throughout the scene grows to a culminating brilliance at the close .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Where ?</speaker>
     <p>Minstrel</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Here</speaker>
     <p>He is coming out of the cave .— Some one is coming out of the cave .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>How wonderful</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Leader</speaker>
     <p>He is nowhere .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Nowhere ?</speaker>
     <p>Leader</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Yes , nowhere</speaker>
     <p>Then what is he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Leader</speaker>
     <p>He is a dream . Then you are the real ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Leader</speaker>
     <p>Yes . And we are the real ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Leader</speaker>
     <p>Yes . Those who saw you from behind imagined you in all kinds of shapes . We did n't recognize you through the dust .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>You seemed old</speaker>
     <p>And then you came out of the cave ,— and now you look like a boy . It seems just as if we had seen you for the first time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Chandra</speaker>
     <p>You are first every time . You are first over and over again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Leader</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Chandra ! You must own your defeat . You could n't catch the Old</l>
      <l>Man .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Chandra</speaker>
     <p>Let our festival begin . The sun is up . Minstrel , if you keep so still , you will swoon away . Sing something .<stage>The Minstrel sings .</stage>I lose thee , to find thee back again and again , My beloved . Thou leavest me , that I may receive thee all the more , when thou returnest . Thou canst vanish behind the moment 's screen Only because thou art mine for evermore , My beloved . When I go in search of thee , my heart trembles , spreading ripples across my love . Thou smilest through thy disguise of utter absence , and my tears sweeten thy smile . Do you hear the hum ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Yes</speaker>
     <p>They are not bees , but the people of the place . Then Dada must be near at hand with his quatrains .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dada</speaker>
     <p>Is this the Leader ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Yes , Dada</speaker>
     <p>Dada Oh , I am so glad you have come . I must read my collection of quatrains . No . No . Not the whole collection , but only one .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dada</speaker>
     <p>Very well . One will do . The sun is at the gate of the East , his drum of victory sounding in the sky . The Night says I am blessed , my death is bliss . He receives his alms of gold , filling his wallet ,— and departs . That is to say —— No . We do n't want your that is to say .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dada</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>It means ——</l>
      <l>Whatever it means , we are determined not to know it .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dada</speaker>
     <p>What makes you so desperate ? It is our festival day .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dada</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Ah ! Is that so ? Then let me go to all the neighbours ——</l>
      <l>No , you must n't go there .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dada</speaker>
     <p>But is there any need for me here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Yes</speaker>
     <p>Then my quatrains ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Chandra</speaker>
     <p>We shall colour your quatrains with such a thick brush , that no one will know whether they have any meaning at all . And then you will be without any means . The neighbourhood will desert you . The Watchman will take you to be a fool . And the Pundit will take you to be a blockhead . And your own people will consider you to be useless . And the outside people will consider you queer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Chandra</speaker>
     <p>But we shall crown you , Dada , with a crown of new leaves . We shall put a garland of jasmine round your neck . And there will be no one else except ourselves who will know your true worth . THE SONG OF THE FESTIVAL OF SPRING<stage>In which all the persons of the drama , not excepting Sruti-bhushan , unite on the main stage in the dance of Spring .</stage>Come and rejoice , for April is awake . Fling yourselves into the flood of being , bursting the bondage of the past . April is awake . Life 's shoreless sea is heaving in the sun before you . All the losses are lost , and death is drowned in its waves . Plunge into the deep without fear , with the gladness of April in your heart .</p>
