    <p>TO MY LITTLE FRIENDS , THE CHILDREN IN THE DRAMATIC CLUB OF THE HYDE PARK CHURCH OF DISCIPLES , THIS BOOK IS LOVINGLY DEDICATED GENERAL PREFACE The progress in religious education in the last few years has been highly encouraging . The subject has attained something of a status as a scientific study , and significant investigative and experimental work has been done . More than that , trained men and women in increasing numbers have been devoting themselves to the endeavor to work out in churches and Sunday schools the practical problems of organization and method . It would seem that the time has come to present to the large body of workers in the field of religious education some of the results of the studies and practice of those who have attained a measure of educational success . With this end in view the present series of books on “ Principles and Methods of Religious Education ” has been undertaken . It is intended that these books , while thoroughly scientific in character , shall be at the same time popular in presentation , so that they may be available to Sunday-school and church workers everywhere . The endeavor is definitely made to take into account the small school with meager equipment , as well as to hold before the larger schools the ideals of equipment and training . The series is planned to meet as far as possible all the problems that arise in the conduct of the educational work of the church . While the Sunday school , therefore , is considered as the basal organization for this purpose , the wider educational work of the pastor himself and that of the various other church organizations receive due consideration as parts of a unified system of education in morals and religion .</p>

    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">BY EDWARD SCRIBNER AMES</p>
    <p n="2">This book is its own best commendation , for it is a most convincing record of an important experiment in education . It is the more interesting because it is a real contribution to educational method from the field of religious education , which too often only appropriates and imitates what has been achieved elsewhere .</p>
    <p n="3">This experiment is founded upon the powerful dramatic impulse of children and upon the educative value of the natural expression of that impulse under the mutual self-criticism of the participating group . The function of the leader has been that of an unobtrusive member of the group contributing such suggestions from a wider experience and deeper insight as would naturally elicit and guide that criticism . That this fine art of teaching has been realized with unusual skill in this experiment will be apparent to the discerning readers of this record , as it has been by those who have watched the progress of the work itself .</p>
    <p n="4">Too much emphasis cannot be given to the fact that the primary aim of this use of dramatization is the education of the children and not the entertainment of spectators , although , when such dramatization is rightly estimated , nothing could be more genuinely entertaining . Those who are expecting to find here ready-made plays for children , with directions for staging them , will be properly disappointed , while those who are seeking illustrations of vital methods of education through the cultivation and use of the dramatic impulse will be amply rewarded .</p>
    <p n="5">The latter will appreciate the frank portrayal of the early and cruder efforts of the children and their own critical reactions due to further reflection and experimentation . These will understand something of the ability and patience that Miss Miller has employed in allowing the native impulse to develop naturally and to mature through the reactions of the children themselves . They will realize that the little people actually formulated the scenes and the lines of the dramas even if it required many weeks in some cases to do so ; that it is better for the actors to make their own costumes and stage properties , however simple they may be ; that it is more educative for each child to be familiar with all of the parts , and thus with the drama as a whole , than to be coached ever so cleverly to impersonate a single character ; and that facility and power in dramatization are thus attained which are permanent sources of pleasure and understanding .</p>
    <p n="6">It need scarcely be added that the biblical stories are exceptionally well suited to such use and that when so employed they yield their profound religious quality directly in deep and lasting impressions . The children who have been so fortunate as to belong to this dramatic club not only “ know ” these stories , but they have lived them in an intimate and durable experience .</p>

   <head>CHAPTER I</head>
   <head>EDUCATIONAL AIMS IN DRAMATIZATION</head>
   <stage>Dramatization is not commonly recognized as a means of vitalizing the religious education of children . The public school has found it to be one of the most effective methods for enriching the pupil 's ideas of given units of subject-matter and for leading to the establishment of permanent interests and of habitual modes of action .</stage>
   <stage>The use of dramatization in the school in order to accomplish these ends finds its justification in certain fundamental principles of teaching . Subject-matter is so presented that the important ideas stand out clearly . These ideas are mastered by utilizing them in some form of activity which leads to self-expression on the part of the children . Judgments are formed and conclusions are reached when children enter actively into a situation which presents a problem ; ideas become their own through experience . Through dramatization children give expression to these ideas in the light of their own interpretation . The formulation of standards , the placing of values , and the realization of truths and ideals follow as direct results of actively entering into the life-experience of others .</stage>
   <stage>From a psychological point of view ideas and ideals , whether religious or secular , are developed according to the same general laws . Furthermore , the principles of teaching which are effective in the daily classroom must be equally significant in religious training . It follows , therefore , that dramatization and other forms of self-expression are as valuable in attaining the aims of the Sunday school as they are in teaching the curriculum of the day school . Through dramatizing a Bible story children come into a comprehension of the life-experiences of a highly religious people ; they are forming their own standards and ideals through meeting and solving the simple life-problems of the Hebrews . Each child has as great an opportunity for self-expression through dramatizing a Bible story as that afforded through dramatizing any other story . He not only develops his individuality , but through this kind of work he must necessarily come into the realization of his place within the group , as is the case in all well-directed dramatization .</stage>
   <stage>The period is rapidly passing in which dramatics is looked upon by church members as being sinful and not in any way to be connected with the church . This view is a relic of a conception of religion in which all forms of freedom and pleasure were considered evil . People interested in religious education are now realizing that dramatization is not an activity foreign to children , but that it is an outgrowth of the play interest which is natural to all children . They are aware of the fact that dramatization becomes evident in the earliest stages of childhood through the desire of children to imitate in play the surrounding social activities . Many churches have already made use of these natural tendencies by incorporating organized play as one of their activities . Since dramatization is but a specialized form of organized play , and inasmuch as it can be used very effectively in vitalizing the religious training which all children should receive , it deserves a wider recognition and adoption .</stage>
   <stage>This book contains a description of a children 's dramatic club which has been conducted as a part of the work of the Sunday school of the Hyde Park Church of Disciples , Chicago , Illinois , for the purpose of accomplishing the ends stated above . Before this dramatic club was organized a small amount of dramatization was attempted in certain of the classes during the Sunday-school period . The enthusiastic response from the children to this new phase of the work revealed the need for more of this kind of activity , and as a consequence it was decided to devote one hour each Sunday afternoon to the dramatization of Bible stories . The membership of the club included children ranging from six to fourteen years of age . The average attendance has been from twenty to thirty children each Sunday throughout these four years of the club 's existence .</stage>
   <stage>This organization was attempted more or less as an experiment with the hope that definite results could be accomplished . The practical problems which have arisen , the details of method of procedure , and the results which have been secured will be discussed in the following chapters .</stage>
   <stage>Several of the stories are given in the dramatic form which the children have worked out . This is done for the sake of showing what kind of a result may be secured . It is hoped that these plays , as they are written here , will not be given to children to learn and act ; such a procedure would be entirely contrary to the spirit and purpose in which this experiment is set forth .</stage>
   <p>CHAPTER II</p>
   <p>THE METHOD OF DRAMATIZATION</p>
   <stage>Two very different aims are revealed in the present-day employment of dramatization . Children are often required to give a dramatic production at some entertainment or social event . For this purpose a story is selected which has already been put into dramatic form . The parts are assigned by the leader , and the children are asked to memorize these parts in exact form and order . The children are then trained to give their parts according to directions . Throughout the preparation of the play the finished production is the goal of endeavor . In such instances as this the children are a means to an end , and their own training and development are usually sacrificed in the leader 's attempt to secure a highly finished product .</stage>
   <stage>In contrast to the case just mentioned , dramatization is looked upon as an important educational factor in the development of children . From this point of view dramatization is utilized in developing on the part of the child intense and permanent interests in the words and deeds of noble characters , in developing power of natural expression in them as individuals and as members of a group , and in raising standards of action to higher levels by giving forceful expression to worthy ideals . These aims are realized through the use of informal methods which give the children abundant opportunity for initiative and choice . The children themselves prepare their dramatization under the guidance of a leader who has a vision of the results which may be secured and who is skilful in directing the activities toward these ends .</stage>
   <stage>The little dramatic club herein described adopted at the outset the point of view outlined in the preceding paragraph . Its organization was based on the belief that the development of boys and girls is a much more vital consideration than the development of a dramatic production . Throughout its history the chief purpose of the club has been to promote the growth of children through the free , spontaneous dramatization of Bible stories . In order to accomplish this aim , an informal method of working out dramatizations has been used . The public presentation of a play is only incidental to the children ; there is no need for them to act out a story that has been dramatized by someone else . Their aim is realized in the joy of actually living the story over each time they play it , though this may result in the highest form of entertainment . That children should “ speak lines ” given them to memorize for the sake of entertainment is deadly — to the child as well as to the audience .</stage>
   <stage>There is some difference of opinion as to the value of the classic language of the Bible for children , and many advocate the use of modern or simplified versions . If , however , the children have made their own efforts to dramatize the story , using first of all their own words , it is easy to help them to adopt much of the beautiful classic language in putting the work into its final form . The biblical wording helps to give the play its proper dignity and atmosphere , at the same time acquainting the children with the exact language of a piece of good literature .</stage>
   <stage>The method of procedure which is followed in leading children to work out their own dramatizations varies slightly according to circumstances but in the main is as follows :</stage>
   <stage>A story is chosen by the leader which includes the elements essential for a good dramatization , and it is told to the children in such a way that the action or events are emphasized . Direct discourse is used in the telling , and an effort is made to develop simple and vivid mental pictures . The children divide the story into its most important pictures or scenes . They then suggest in detail what should take place in the first scene , and some of them are asked to act it out as they think it should be done . This first presentation is sometimes stiff and more or less self-conscious . The leader raises such questions as , “ Which parts did these children do best ? ” “ Why ? ” “ Where can they improve it ? ” “ What would you do to make the part better ? ” “ What do you think should have been said here ? ” This leads to constructive criticism of the scene by the children themselves rather than by the leader in charge . Each child is eager to offer suggestions at this point and is anxious for an opportunity to give his own interpretation of the part by acting it out . He formulates his words as he acts . He forgets himself in the genuine interest which arises as he relives the experience of someone else . Each scene is developed in a similar manner .</stage>
   <stage>The leader encourages freedom in individual interpretation , yet she is ever keeping before the children the fact that they are trying to give a true portrayal of the characters or conditions . It is often valuable to have a discussion of individual characters for the purpose of securing clear ideas concerning them . After all have tried various parts and have offered many suggestions , they may be led to choose that interpretation which seems most adequate , or they may all work out the interpretation of a part which will involve the ideas of many . After the story has been played through a few times , each child should be able to assume any character . It is an essential part of this method to see that every child has a different part each time .</stage>
   <stage>Very often , when the play develops to this stage , some one child , or several , will suddenly become aware of repetitions in the scenes and will suggest that some scenes are unnecessary . It is then the time to refer to the number of scenes in a good drama , and to lead the children to realize that in any good play much is left to the imagination of the audience , and that only the essential scenes need be shown . By means of discussions the play is worked over again , and it is finally reduced to the three or four scenes that seem absolutely necessary .</stage>
   <stage>In many instances the dramatization needs no further development . None of the words have been accepted as definite , for , although the thought given is the same each time , exactly the same words are never said twice . The story is interpreted slightly differently with each performance . This interpretation , without obtaining a highly finished result , is best for short stories or incidents . Fables and parables may be used well in this way . The action follows continuously with the development of the thought .</stage>
   <stage>In the case of a story which has a more detailed plot and which involves more complicated situations the development may go further : the wording is carefully worked out by the children and the language of the Bible is employed . The words which are finally used by the children may be composite results developed by the group as a whole , or after they have gone as far as they can with them the leader , or a committee composed of several children with the leader , may suggest a final form which is good from a literary standpoint .</stage>
   <stage>Children either volunteer or are chosen by the others to take finally certain parts . There is a marked socializing influence evident in the fact that a child is chosen by the other children for the good of the group and not for self-aggrandizement or partiality toward a friend . It is always the case after a few rehearsals that each child knows every part and can easily adapt himself to the part of any character . There is no trouble about a substitute when one or two children fail to arrive . Each child has lived the story until it has become a very vital part of him . The finished product belongs to the children ; they have developed it ; it is not the production of someone else which they have learned by heart .</stage>
   <stage>At the final presentation of the play the children invite parents and friends . This is not thought of as a climax toward which they have been working ; it is hardly more important than any of the rehearsals ; it is simply an opportunity for others to enjoy the story with them . The encouragement of this attitude toward the public presentation of a play is important in that it does away with the self-conscious feeling of a child that he is acting before people , or that people are interested in him rather than in the character that he portrays . Much harm can be done by allowing a child to feel that he is “ showing off ” on a stage .</stage>
   <stage>This mode of procedure in developing a dramatization illustrates the general method which is employed in order to secure the results herein discussed . It should be helpful as a method which may be varied or built upon according to the circumstances . Detailed descriptions of exact modes of procedure in presenting different kinds of Bible stories to the dramatic club will follow . Costumes and stage settings have always been of the simplest nature and will be discussed at length in a separate chapter .</stage>
   <stage>In order that this method may be of greatest practical value to those who are unfamiliar with it , a summary may give the steps in logical sequence . This outline is not to be taken as unchangeable , but merely as a working basis for the beginner .</stage>
   <stage>1 . Select a story with care ; then adapt it for telling .</stage>
   <stage>2 . Tell the story , emphasizing the essential parts .</stage>
   <stage>3 . Let the children divide the story into pictures or scenes .</stage>
   <stage>4 . Have a discussion of what should take place in each scene .</stage>
   <stage>5 . Let volunteers from among the children act out one scene as they think it should be done , using their own words .</stage>
   <stage>6 . Develop criticism by the other children with suggestions for improvement .</stage>
   <stage>7 . Have a second acting of the scene for improvement .</stage>
   <stage>8 . Let each of the other scenes be worked out in the same manner .</stage>
   <stage>9 . See that every child has the chance to try out many parts .</stage>
   <stage>10 . Play the story through many times . Change it often according to the criticism , until the children recognize the result as a product of their best effort .</stage>
   <stage>11 . With the help of the children change the words into biblical form .</stage>
   <stage>12 . Let the group assign definite parts to be learned for the final performance .</stage>
   <p>CHAPTER III</p>
   <p>THE DRAMATIZATION OF JOSEPH</p>
   <stage>As will be noted in the following chapter , it is well in beginning dramatic work with children to use for the first efforts very simple stories . Joseph is too long and complicated for an early experiment . We may begin our exposition of method with this story , however , as it illustrates especially well the details of the developing process .</stage>
   <stage>At the first meeting the story was told in terms that followed closely the Bible version . The children were asked to select the big events , or pictures , in Joseph 's life . They readily spoke of his life in Canaan as a boy ; his being put into the pit and sold to the merchants ; his life in Egypt with Potiphar ; the prison experience and the interpretation of Pharaoh 's dream ; the change of fortune in becoming ruler of the land ; the famine and the visits of his brothers ; and , finally , his kindness to his father and brothers in giving them a home in Egypt .</stage>
   <stage>The story was told to the children very much as follows :</stage>
   <stage>Jacob was an old man , too old to care for his large flocks . He sat in the door of his tent day after day , and sent his twelve sons off with the sheep and goats to find grassy fields .</stage>
   <stage>Now of all the twelve sons Jacob loved Joseph , a lad of seventeen years , the best . Joseph was next to the youngest and often stayed with his father while the older brothers went away . Jacob gave Joseph a coat of many colors and showed him often that he was the favorite . This made the older brothers very jealous of Joseph , and they began to dislike him .</stage>
   <stage>Once Joseph dreamed a dream , which he told to his brothers , and it made them hate him all the more . He said to them , “ Hear , I pray you , this dream which I have dreamed : Behold , we were binding sheaves in the field , and , lo , my sheaf arose , and stood upright ; and , behold , your sheaves stood round about and bowed down to my sheaf . ” Then his brothers said to him , “ Shalt thou indeed reign over us ? or shalt thou have power over us ? ”</stage>
   <stage>Then Joseph dreamed yet another dream , and he told it again to his father and brothers , and said , “ Behold , the sun and moon and the eleven stars bowed down to me . ” And his father said unto him , “ What is this dream that thou hast dreamed ? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee ? ” And the brothers remembered what their father had said , and they wished that harm might come to Joseph .</stage>
   <stage>It happened soon after this that Jacob sent his ten older sons with the flocks to Shechem , a place some distance away where there was good grass . Now the brothers were gone for so long a time that their father became anxious and decided to send Joseph after them . He said to Joseph , “ Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem ? Go , I pray thee , see whether it be well with thy brethren and well with the flocks ; and bring me word again . ” So Joseph took money and food in his bag , and his staff in his hand , and went out to find his brothers .</stage>
   <stage>At Shechem there were no brothers to be seen . Joseph was wondering what he should do next , when he saw a man coming toward him over the field . “ What seekest thou ? ” said the man . And Joseph answered , “ I seek my brethren ; tell me , I pray thee , where they feed their flocks . ” “ They have departed from here , ” said the man , “ and have gone to Dothan . ” Then Joseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothan .</stage>
   <stage>Now when the brothers saw Joseph afar off , they knew that it was he from his coat of many colors , and they plotted against him . One of them said , “ Behold , this dreamer cometh . Come , now , let us slay him , and cast him into some pit , and we will say unto our father that some evil beast hath devoured him ; and we shall see what will become of his dreams . ” Reuben , one of the brothers , felt more kindly toward Joseph than did the others and said to them , “ Let us not kill him , but let us cast him into this pit that is near . ” Reuben thought that he would come back later after the brothers had gone and help Joseph out of the pit and take him to his father .</stage>
   <stage>When Joseph came to his brothers , they quickly took the coat of many colors from him and bound him and cast him into an old well which was dry . Then they sat down to eat bread . They had hardly become settled when one of them cried out , “ Behold , I see a caravan ! It is a company of Ishmaelites , with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh , going down to Egypt . ” Then Judah said , “ Why do we slay our brother and conceal his blood ? Come , let us sell him to these Ishmaelites , and let not our hand be upon him , for he is our brother and our flesh . ” The brothers were content to do as Judah had said . They drew Joseph up out of the well , and when the Ishmaelites came near they sold him to them for twenty pieces of silver . And the brothers went away to kill a goat so that they might dip Joseph 's coat into the blood , that their father might think that he had been killed by some wild animal .</stage>
   <stage>Reuben did not know that Joseph had been sold , and returned unto the pit after the brothers had left . When he saw that Joseph was not there , he rent his clothes , and ran after the others , crying , “ The child is not , and I , whither shall I go ? ”</stage>
   <stage>And when the brothers brought Joseph 's coat to their father , they said , “ This we have found , thou knowest if it be thy son 's coat . ” And Jacob knew it , and said , “ It is my son 's coat ; an evil beast hath devoured him . ” Then Jacob put on sackcloth and ashes and mourned for Joseph many days .</stage>
   <stage>Now the Ishmaelites brought Joseph down into Egypt and sold him to Potiphar , a captain of King Pharaoh 's guard . And Joseph was faithful and served the Lord , and Potiphar saw that he could be trusted with great responsibility and made him ruler over his household . But Potiphar 's wife grew jealous of Joseph and disliked him , and told Potiphar things which were untrue about Joseph . After awhile Potiphar began to believe his wife and he decided that Joseph was not a good man , so he had Joseph cast into prison .</stage>
   <stage>And it came to pass that the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt were put into prison at the same time that Joseph was there , and they were placed in his ward . One morning Joseph found them both very sad and he said unto them , “ Wherefore look ye so sadly today ? ” And they said , “ We have dreamed a dream and there is no one to interpret it . ” Then Joseph said , “ Do not interpretations belong to God ? Tell me your dreams , I pray you . ” And they told him their dreams , and he gave them the meaning thereof . To the chief butler he said , “ Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head and restore thee to thy place . ” But to the chief baker he said , “ Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee , and shall hang thee on a tree . ” And it came to pass that on the third day Pharaoh gave a feast to his servants , and he restored the chief butler to his place , but he hanged the chief baker , as Joseph had interpreted .</stage>
   <stage>At the end of two years Pharaoh dreamed a dream . He was greatly troubled , and sent for all the wise men of the land to tell him the meaning of his dream , but there was none that could interpret it unto Pharaoh . Then the chief butler spoke to the king and said , “ I do remember this day , that when Pharaoh was wroth with his servants and put both me and the chief baker into the prison , that we each dreamed dreams in one night ; and there was a young man there , a Hebrew , who interpreted to us our dreams , and they came to pass as he interpreted , for the chief baker was hanged and I was restored to my office . ”</stage>
   <stage>Then Pharaoh sent for Joseph , and they brought him in hastily out of the dungeon . And Pharaoh said , “ I have dreamed a dream , and there is none that can interpret it , and I have heard say of thee that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it . ” And Joseph answered Pharaoh , “ It is not in me ; God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace . ” Then Pharaoh said , “ In my dream , behold , I stood upon the bank of a river ; and there came up out of the river seven fat cows , and they fed in a meadow . And , behold , seven other cows came up after them , lean and ill favored ; and the lean and ill-favored cows did eat up the fat and well-favored cows . Then I dreamed again , and , behold , seven full ears of corn came upon one stalk , and then seven ears , withered and thin , came up after them , and devoured the good ears . ”</stage>
   <stage>And Joseph said to Pharaoh , “ God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do . This is the thing which he is about to do : Behold , there will come seven years of plenty throughout the land of Egypt ; and there shall rise up after them seven years of famine , and the famine shall consume the land . Now , therefore , let Pharaoh look out a man , discreet and wise , and set him over the land of Egypt , and let him gather up all the food during the years of plenty and lay it up in the cities , so that the land shall not perish in the famine . ” And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh , and he said , “ Can we find such a one as this is , a man in whom the spirit of God is ? Forasmuch as God has shewed thee all this , there is none so discreet and wise as thou art ; thou shalt be over my house , and according to thy word shall all my people be ruled . ” Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and clothed him in fine linen and put a golden chain around his neck .</stage>
   <stage>Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went over all the land of Egypt . He gathered up the food for seven years , and laid up the food in the cities . And the seven years of plenteousness that were in all the land of Egypt were ended , and the seven years of famine began , and there was famine in all the lands . Then Joseph opened the storehouses and sold to the Egyptians , and other countries sent to buy grain from Joseph because they had stored none .</stage>
   <stage>Now in Canaan Jacob and his eleven sons were suffering from the famine . They heard that there was food in Egypt , so Jacob sent down all the brothers , except Benjamin , to buy food . When they came before Joseph and bowed themselves to the earth , they knew him not . But Joseph saw his brothers , and he made himself strange unto them , and treated them roughly , that they should not know him . And when they bowed before him Joseph remembered the dreams that he had dreamed of them . “ Ye are spies , ” he said , “ ye are come to see the bareness of the land . ” They answered him , “ We are true men , we are no spies . Thy servants are twelve brothers , the sons of one man in Canaan ; and , behold , the youngest is this day with our father , and one is not . ” “ Hereby ye shall be proved , ” said Joseph , “ if ye be true men ; let one of your brethren be bound in the prison while ye go and carry grain to your father 's house , but bring back your youngest brother to me . ”</stage>
   <stage>The brothers took the food back to Canaan , to their father 's tent , and told him what the ruler in Egypt had said . Jacob mourned and was loath to let Benjamin , his youngest son , go back to Egypt with them . “ My son shall not go down with you , ” he said ; “ for his brother is dead and he is left alone : if mischief befall him , then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave . ” But the famine was great in the land , and they had eaten up all the grain which they brought from Egypt . The brothers would not go down again until Jacob had consented to let them take Benjamin with them . And Judah said unto his father , “ Send the lad with me and we will rise and go , that we may live and not die . I will be surety for him ; if I bring him not back unto thee , then let me bear the blame forever . ” Then Jacob answered , “ If it must be so , do this : take the best of the fruits in the land , and carry down the man a present , a little balm , and a little honey , spices , and myrrh , nuts , and almonds and take double money , and take also your brother , and arise and go unto the man ; and God Almighty give you mercy before the man , that he may send you away with your other brother and Benjamin . ”</stage>
   <stage>And the men took the present and double the money and Benjamin , and went down into Egypt , and stood before Joseph . When Joseph saw Benjamin , he ordered that the men be brought to his home , and that a feast be made ready , and that the other brother be brought out of the prison . But the men were afraid because they were brought into Joseph 's home , and they bowed themselves to the earth before him and presented their gifts . Then Joseph was greatly moved and said unto them , “ Is your father well , the old man of whom ye spake ? Is he yet alive ? ” And they answered , “ Thy servant , our father , is in good health ; he is yet alive . ” And they bowed down their heads . Then Joseph lifted up his eyes and saw Benjamin , his mother 's youngest son , and said , “ Is this your younger brother of whom ye spake unto me ? ” And he said to Benjamin , “ God be gracious unto thee , my son . ” Joseph was so overcome by his love for Benjamin that he hastened out of the room where he could weep alone . And he washed his face and composed himself and commanded that the food be served . They all ate and were merry , and Joseph helped Benjamin to five times as much as he did the others .</stage>
   <stage>Then Joseph commanded the steward to fill the men 's sacks with food , and to put each man 's money back into his sack , and to put his silver cup into the sack of the youngest . As soon as the morning was light the men were sent away . And when they were gone out of the city and were not yet far off , Joseph sent a servant after them to search their sacks for his silver drinking-cup , and he sent word that the one who had it should be brought back to him .</stage>
   <stage>Now the brothers were greatly distressed and protested that they knew nothing of the cup . What was their astonishment at finding their money in their sacks and the cup in Benjamin 's sack ! Then they rent their clothes and returned to the city . And Judah came to Joseph and fell on the ground and said , “ What shall we say unto my lord ? or how shall we clear ourselves ? God hath found out our sin , behold we are my lord 's servants . ” Then Joseph said , “ Get up and go in peace unto thy father ; I shall keep for my servant only the man in whose sack the cup was found . ” And Judah came near to Joseph and besought him that he allow Benjamin to return to their father ; he told him that he had promised his father to bring the lad back safely , and that it would kill the old man if they returned without Benjamin . “ Now therefore , I pray thee , let thy servant abide as a bondman , instead of the lad . ” Then Joseph could not refrain himself , and he wept before his brothers and made himself known to them . “ I am Joseph , do ye not know me ? Is my father yet alive ? ” And the brothers were troubled , and they did not know how to answer him . “ Come near , I pray you . ” And they came near , and he said again , “ I am Joseph , your brother , whom ye sold into Egypt . Now be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye sold me hither , for God did send me before you to preserve your lives . Haste ye , go up to my father , and tell him that Joseph , his son , still liveth , and bring him down unto me . ” And Joseph fell upon Benjamin 's neck and kissed him , and he kissed all his brothers , and they were astonished , for they knew now that this was Joseph whom they had sold .</stage>
   <stage>Now the word was spread over Pharaoh 's house that Joseph 's brethren had come , and it pleased Pharaoh greatly . He came in where they were and said unto Joseph , “ This do ye : Say to your brethren that they are commanded to go back into Canaan , and to pack all their household goods , and to bring their father and their families , and all their flocks , and to return into the land of Egypt , for all the good of the land shall be theirs . ”</stage>
   <stage>Then the brothers were joyful , and gave thanks unto Pharaoh and to their brother , Joseph , and they left the city to go back to their father . And when they came unto Jacob and told him all , and showed him the wagons which Joseph had sent to bring him down into Egypt , his soul rejoiced , and he said , “ It is enough ; Joseph , my son , is still alive : I will go and see him before I die . ”</stage>
   <stage>The children decided that it would take a great many scenes in order to act out the story adequately . At first they mentioned seven or eight . One child was asked to describe the first scene as he thought it ought to be , and several others added to the description . Volunteers were then called upon to act it out then and there .</stage>
   <stage>The first scene was placed in front of Jacob 's tent . Jacob is anxiously awaiting the return of his ten sons with the flocks . He becomes worried because they do not come , so he sends Joseph to seek his brothers . Joseph accepts the command and leaves the tent .</stage>
   <stage>This scene was acted very naturally and spontaneously by several groups of children . Each time it was changed , for no two groups of children interpreted the action or words alike .</stage>
   <stage>The children who were not acting were made to feel their responsibility also , for they were asked to make note of the best parts . A general discussion was held at the end of each presentation , in which the good points were emphasized and suggestions were given as to improvement . The criticism in all of this work comes for the most part from the children ; the leader in charge directs it , but keeps from imposing her opinions .</stage>
   <stage>As the meetings of this dramatic club last but one hour , nothing more could be done than work out one scene at this first time . The children were asked to think the story over and to come the next Sunday prepared to suggest the second and third scenes in detail .</stage>
   <stage>At the next meeting the second and third scenes were worked out in the same manner as the first .</stage>
   <stage>The second scene places Joseph at Shechem . Here he meets the man who tells him that his brothers have gone to Dothan .</stage>
   <stage>In the third scene the brothers are seated on the ground eating and resting , with their shepherd staffs beside them ; they begin to talk about Joseph and to tell of his dream and their hatred of him . Just at this point Joseph runs in and gives his father 's message . He also tells of his experience in Shechem in not finding them there . Then the brothers take him and bind him and throw him into the pit . The caravan comes along and Joseph is sold and taken away . After the brothers depart , Reuben , not knowing that Joseph has been sold , comes back to the pit , hoping to help him out . When he finds the boy gone , he weeps and goes sorrowfully away . ( A doorway which leads off from the stage at the back was used for the pit . There were no camels in the caravan ; the men walked by . )</stage>
   <stage>During the next hour scenes which describe Joseph 's life in Egypt were roughly blocked out . The children made up their words as they acted the parts . The language at this stage was very modern , but for the time being the emphasis was placed upon the thought expressed and upon the action .</stage>
   <stage>Several of the older girls volunteered to write out the first few scenes in order to bring the language into better form . At the fourth meeting these were brought in and discussed by the children . The following is a version of the first scene just as it was written by a girl of twelve years . It is given here that the contrast may be seen between this as a piece of work which may be made better and the final play at the end of the chapter .</stage>

Whither shall I go ?<stage>REUBEN goes away , sobbing and wringing his hands .</stage>END At the meeting when these were read the children began to criticize the length of the play . One little boy made the remark , “ We keep telling the same things over ; why can n't we leave out that second scene ? It is so short , and Joseph could tell his brothers in the third scene that he did n't find them at Shechem . ” This suggestion was readily accepted , and as a consequence the second scene was omitted . Then the entire group consciously worked on the play to see what parts were unnecessary . Several children had recently been to the theater and had seen some good plays . They told the others that there were few scenes and that there was much left to the imagination of the audience . The result was that this long-drawn-out play was cut down to three essential scenes . The first scene was placed at Dothan , and was much the same as the original scene iii . The second scene was placed at Pharaoh 's palace where Joseph was brought to interpret the king 's dream . The third represented the brothers coming to Joseph with Benjamin , the youngest , ending with Joseph 's forgiveness of them and his sending for Jacob , their father . After these three scenes were decided upon , the older children were asked to begin writing them out in final form . At the fifth meeting of the club all the children sat in a circle with Bibles and pencils and paper and , together with the leader , they formulated the speeches , making them conform as nearly as possible to those in the Bible . The work that had been done outside was discussed and built upon . This part of the procedure did not take as long a time as it may seem , because the children knew so well what thoughts they wanted to express — they had lived the story so many times . They practiced after this , using the words they had decided upon . For the next meeting or two the children acted out the play , trying each time to improve it by better interpretations of the parts . The fact that they had learned definite words did not in the least check the freedom of the action or cause the play to lose the spontaneity which first characterized it , for the reason that the story had quite become a part of the children before they decided upon the set speeches . The question arose as to which children should take certain parts . In some instances several wanted to learn the part of one particular character . They were each given the opportunity of learning it , and then at the next meeting each acted it as best he or she could before the group . The other children were judges and decided upon the one who seemed to represent the character best . Whenever this method of choosing characters has been employed there has never been any hard feeling on the part of a child because he was not chosen . The justice of the choice is quickly recognized when it comes in this way rather than from the leader . There were many little children in this club who were scarcely old enough to learn a part or to say very much . They were easily worked into the caravan , or they took such parts as servants in Pharaoh 's court . Each child was made to feel that one part was just as important as another and that those who had nothing to say were very essential elements because of their acting . Eight or nine meetings were needed before the play was entirely finished . The children had very simple slips for costumes which they had been wearing at each rehearsal . Bright-colored sashes and headdresses they brought from home . Pharaoh was more gaily dressed than the others . The child who took the part made for himself many ornaments from gilt paper . Very little attention was given to stage setting , what was used was extremely simple . A few of the older girls made designs from the Egyptian lotus to stand around the walls of Pharaoh 's palace or to be carried by the servants . Colored illustrations of Bible stories by Tissot were suggestive helps in these details . The ten brothers made themselves shepherd staffs from limbs of trees . This small amount of stage setting and costuming was used at many rehearsals and was all that was necessary to produce the right atmosphere . As soon as the children felt that the play represented their best effort they invited their parents and friends and presented it before them one Sunday afternoon at the time for the regular meeting . It happened that a few days before the final presentation four of the principal characters were taken ill with measles and chicken-pox . Four others , who had not given special attention to these parts , but who had minor parts , assumed the important roles and went straight through the play with no trouble whatever . The audience never knew the difference and the children thought that it was entirely natural that they should be able to do this . The play all the way through was characterized by a spirit of dignity and seriousness . As direct results of this work in dramatization it was noted that all the children had acquired a certain freedom of expression , a self-confidence , without conceit or too much sureness , and the ability to work harmoniously with the group . One or two timid children learned to forget themselves , and one overconfident child was helped by seeing that others could learn to do the part even a little better than herself . The children who took part in this little play of Joseph will never forget it . Several years after the play was given they were frequently referring to it with great happiness . Joseph is one of their favorite characters because they have lived through his experiences with him . The following is the play as it was given in its final form . It is not to be taken as a play which may be given to children to be learned as it is ; it is given here that there may be some idea of the standard which may be reached . JOSEPH</p>

     <p>I dreamed , and , behold , I stood by a river , and there came up out of the river seven fat cows , and they fed in a meadow . And , behold , seven other cows came up after them out of the river , ill-favored and lean . And the ill-favored and lean cows did eat up the seven well-favored and fat cows . Then did I awake , but the second time I slept and dreamed . And , behold , seven good ears of corn came up upon one stalk , and , behold , seven thin ears sprung up after them , and the seven thin ears devoured the seven full ears . And I awoke again , and , behold , it was a dream . Now , is there one among you who can tell me the meaning of these dreams , for my spirit is troubled because of them ?<stage>The wise men in turn come out and bow before the king and say</stage>First Wise Man : O my lord King , thy dream troubleth me , but I am not able to interpret it .

     <p>O King , I do remember my faults this day . When Pharaoh was wroth with his servants and put me in prison , both me and the chief baker , behold , we dreamed a dream in one night , and there was a young man , a Hebrew , and we told him , and he interpreted to us our dream . And it came to pass as he interpreted unto us , for I was restored unto mine office and the baker was hanged .</p>

     <p>What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh : Behold , there will come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt . And there shall arise after them seven years of famine . And all the plenty shall be forgotten throughout Egypt , and the famine shall consume the land , and it shall be very grievous . Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise and set him over the land of Egypt , and let him appoint officers over the land . And let them gather all the food of those good years that come , and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh . And let them keep food in the cities . And that food shall be stored against the seven years of famine , that the land may not perish through famine .</p>

     <p>Praise be to God who has done this good thing ! END CHAPTER IV THE DRAMATIZATION OF DAVID AND GOLIATH When beginning dramatic work with a group of children who have never had the training before , it is always well to select as the first story to be dramatized one that is short , simple in structure , and full of action . If children undertake a long story which involves complicated situations , they easily become discouraged and lose the joy and spontaneity which are essential elements in successful dramatizations . Fables , such as “ The Boy and the Wolf ” or “ The Fox and the Grapes , ” are excellent to begin with , because they contain the necessary qualities which make up a good short story . Situations as simple as those which are presented in these fables are entered into with great freedom , and they seem to pave the way for more ambitious dramatizations . The story of David and Goliath is short , simple , and yet contains vivid action . It was chosen as one of the first stories to be given to the dramatic club because of these qualities . After the children had gone through the experience of dramatizing it they had gained a self-confidence and a realization of their own power in interpreting a story through dramatization . The methods employed in presenting David and Goliath were much the same as those described in connection with Joseph . The point that must be kept in mind in all of this work is that the dramatization of a story begins with the action and that the words are developed . The play is never written first and acted afterward . While telling the story the leader placed much emphasis upon the activities and ideals of the shepherd life of the Hebrews in the time of David . The children made their own armor — helmets , swords , shields — from cardboard and colored papers . Pictures and descriptions which they secured helped them to get correct ideas as to shapes and decorations . The costumes were simple little slips that could be belted in at the waist , and came only to the knees . The children helped to plan and make them . David made his shepherd staff from a limb of a tree , and the soldiers made their spears by fastening gilded points to long sticks . A question arose as to how the sling was made . The children found , upon looking up this point , that the sling was woven from different colored wools . From a good picture they constructed looms from cardboard and actually wove several slings like David 's . Fig . 14 shows a diagram of the loom as the children worked it out . A very great value was derived from this construction work , in that it came entirely from the children ; it was an outgrowth of their genuine interest in the subject . They were reliving the same experiences and solving the same problems that had confronted David . The gentle spirit of David had a direct influence upon the whole group . It made no difference what part a child interpreted — whether that of Goliath or of one of the brothers — it was evident that David 's high ideals and sweetness of character called forth admiration .</p>

END CHAPTER V THE DRAMATIZATION OF MOSES IN THE BULRUSHES The method of presenting the story of Moses in the Bulrushes differed somewhat from that employed with Joseph . There was little need to tell the story at the beginning , for every child already knew it in detail . Consequently the leader had the children tell most of it , while she supplemented and directed attention to important parts . In this case the entire play was planned roughly before any of it was acted . The story was criticized by the children as to its organization and unity , and as a result they made up an ending<stage>Act III</stage>which they felt was needed to make the story complete . Experience with the other plays had led the children to feel the necessity for having a satisfactory ending after the climax . At the second meeting several girls brought in the scenes as they had written them out . They had tried to embody the points which the children had decided upon as the general plan of the play . The final play varies very little from these scenes thus written by the girls themselves . There was no difficulty in solving the problem as to what they would do for a baby in the first part of the play . Many dolls were brought in , and the choice fell upon the one that received the largest number of votes because of his likeness to the baby Moses . A woven basket served for the cradle of bulrushes . There were many rehearsals when there was no doll or cradle , but the children never felt the lack . Their imaginations can supply all needs . A few big Egyptian designs were made for the first and last scenes , which were placed in the king 's court . These were fastened on the walls and around the king 's seat , as was done in the play of Joseph . Before the play was given before parents and friends the children decided to call it The Childhood of Moses . An older boy in the church printed programs for the occasion that the audience might better understand the play . They read as follows : THE CHILDHOOD OF MOSES Dramatized and Presented by the Children 's Dramatic Club of the Hyde Park Church of Disciples CHARACTERS PHARAOH King of Egypt PRINCESS Pharaoh 's Daughter MOSES A Hebrew Boy HEBREW WOMAN Mother of Moses MIRIAM Sister of Moses AARON Brother of Moses WISE MEN Advisers of Pharaoh Soldiers , Attendants to the Princess , Servants SYNOPSIS OF SCENES</p>

      <p>She selleth a parcel of land which was her husband 's . Now , thou art nearest of kin to Naomi , so I thought to advise thee that thou mayest have the first chance to redeem the land in the presence of the elders of the city . If thou dost not care to redeem it , then the right to redeem it cometh to me , for I am next of kin . What wilt thou do ?</p>

END CHAPTER VII THE DRAMATIZATION OF QUEEN ESTHER The story of Esther involves a much more complicated situation than any of the others here described . It is not too difficult for dramatization , however , if it is taken after such stories have been worked out as David and Goliath and Joseph . In the case of this dramatic club the story of Esther was told to the children after they had had much experience with other plays . The interesting plot and the beauty and richness of the court made so great an appeal to them that they were eager to begin the dramatization . The story was first simplified and adapted by the leader , and then told in such a manner as to emphasize the main events . The method of procedure followed that described in chapter iii in connection with the story of Joseph . After the telling of the story the scenes were selected . These were acted out very freely at first , little thought being given to the words . Many pictures were brought in , and descriptions of the court of King Ahasuerus were read by the children from the Bible and from books of Bible stories . In the second scene the children decided to have the maidens dance before the King . Several little girls who were trying out the part of Esther made up dances for themselves . This feature made this scene especially attractive . This play was longer than those that had previously been dramatized , and it therefore took a longer period of time to bring it into final shape . There is no reason to hurry a dramatization . If the aim of this kind of work is kept in mind , there will be growth on the part of the children at each meeting . The value lies , not in how many stories can be dramatized during a year , but in how thoroughly the children are reliving a few good stories . The play of Queen Esther made it necessary to construct several articles . Gold dishes of various kinds were made by covering cardboard with gold paper . These were used at the Queen 's banquet . From the many scepters that were submitted the King chose the one for final use . Elaborate gowns and headdresses were gathered ; beads and jewels of all descriptions were made from brilliantly colored papers . The children took the responsibility of the costuming . The majority of them planned their own garments and either brought things from home or selected some suitable costume from those which the club had on hand . Two of the older girls took entire charge of the younger ones and saw to it that each had some simple slip to wear in the play . The play follows as it was finally worked out by the children .

      <speaker>First Prince</speaker>
      <p>She hath not done wrong to the King only , but also to all the princes of the land , for this deed of the Queen shall become known unto all the women of Media and Persia and they shall despise the command of their husbands : “ Because , ” they shall say , “ King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti , the Queen , to be brought before him and she came not . ”</p>

      <p>This is a great happiness which thou hast bestowed upon me , O King . CHAPTER VIII THE DRAMATIZATION OF ABRAHAM AND THE THREE GUESTS This incident should be simplified and adapted before it is told to children . The dramatization is best worked out in the form of a short , free play which involves only one act . It is unnecessary to carry it to the point of fixed words and actions . The emphasis should be placed upon the customs of the times which are so well brought out in the story ; for example , the hospitality of Abraham to the strangers represents the feeling toward strangers among the nomad peoples , and the manner in which he showed his hospitality makes children acquainted with customs peculiar to those people . There is excellent opportunity here for enriching the children 's understanding of the life of a shepherd people , of which the Israelites are an example . Descriptions and pictures of the kind of tent the people lived in are necessary . It is important that children should get the idea of the correct shape of the Arab tent and not confuse it with the Indian wigwam . No stage scenery need be used ; it is best to leave that to the imagination . A curtain may be put up to represent the front of the tent , but nothing more . There is much of this incident that should be left out in the telling ; by no means should it be read directly from the Bible to children . The story may be told so that the following points are emphasized : Abraham is sitting at the door of his tent . Three men appear ; he runs to meet them and bows to the ground . He invites them to rest under the shade of the tree and offers to get food and to have their feet washed . The strangers sit and talk together , then Abraham comes with the food . They all eat and are rested , and as they rise to depart they ask for Sarah , Abraham 's wife . The strangers tell Sarah and Abraham that they are to have a son whose name shall be Isaac and whom God shall bless and who shall be the father of many people . Abraham and Sarah are greatly astonished and pleased . They fall upon their knees to thank God , and when they arise they find that the strangers have departed . The scene closes with their exclamation , “ Surely these were angels from the Lord who have visited us ! ” This story was dramatized by the children of the dramatic club after they had had experience with many other dramatizations . During the first hour after the story was told the children succeeded in getting the play into very nearly its final form . Two of the older girls , undertaking to write out the scenes as they thought they should be , brought in their versions at the second meeting . Each one was read aloud , the other children being asked to remember the parts that seemed especially good . Then by combining , adding to , or taking from , a composite result was obtained . Several children wrote down the final decisions at the dictation of the group . Below is given the version which one child worked out by herself , and following that is the final form of the play which the group as a whole decided upon . The leader purposely left this play entirely in the hands of the children ; the product is wholly their own . THE PLAY EXACTLY AS ONE CHILD WROTE IT</p>

END As this play was very short , the suggestion was made that we might lengthen the program , as well as make it more interesting , by having some of the children tell the audience just how we worked up the dramatization . The two older girls undertook this and decided entirely by themselves just what they would say . One of them wrote with great care a description of the method of procedure . She read it to the club for approval , then she learned it by heart and gave it in an interesting manner to the audience on the day the play was given . The other girl wrote a poem about it , and recited it just before the play was given . The description and poem are as follows : THE INTRODUCTION BY MARGARET MILLER The play which the children are now going to give — Abraham and the Three Guests — has been worked out and practiced at the dramatic club . This club meets every Sunday afternoon from three until four o'clock , and is composed of any of the children of the Sunday school who wish to belong . The first Sunday Miss Miller told the story to the members , and then they , knowing it , acted it out , making up the parts as they went along . This they did several times until they knew the story perfectly . The two oldest girls did not take part in the acting of the play , but became assistants and helped Miss Miller direct it . During the next week the assistants wrote out the speeches very much as the children had made them up . These were read before the club and discussed , and after a number of suggestions had been added by all the children present the scene was finally written as it now is . The children each took home a part to learn , and the following Sunday they all tried the different speeches . Before the final characters were chosen each child was able to represent any one of them . The final characters were decided upon by the group and were chosen according to their preferences and their ability to enact the different parts . Unfortunately , most of the costumes which the club had on hand were much too small for the children this year . We therefore held a sewing-bee during the week , and lengthened the old ones or made new ones where we found it necessary . We have worked on this play for five meetings , which represents altogether five hours , except for a little work that the assistants did outside . We have had much fun with this play , and we are hoping that you will enjoy it too . POEM BY MELBA PYLE Before you soon you shall see The story of Abraham and the Strangers Three . The partakers , they have worked ; The assistants , they have shirked — But not as much as you would think , For they have helped to join each link . As day by day passed quickly away We read the Bible and wrote the play . Each child helped as best he could , And thus we worked in brotherhood . Word with word we did neatly join , Then home we went , our parts to learn , Next to the box where the costumes lay , And straight to sewing and not to play . And ‘ tis our happy aim , you see , To make you joyous as can be ! CHAPTER IX THE DRAMATIZATION OF DANIEL IN THE LIONS ’ DEN The story of Daniel in the Lions ’ Den was dramatized by the members of the club according to the same methods as those which were used in connection with the story of Abraham and the Three Guests . This play is given here in order to show how a story which deals with a miraculous event may be treated . When Daniel was thrust into the den of lions , he was in reality put out of the door which opens at the side of the stage . The children readily came to the decision that it was unnecessary to show Daniel actually in the den of lions on the stage . In telling the story no explanation was made or asked for concerning the miracle which happened . The children accepted it and enjoyed it as they would any other good story . The final play which follows represents entirely the children 's interpretation ; the product is their own . DANIEL IN THE LIONS ’ DEN</p>

      <p>Ah , that is true ; Daniel worshipeth a different God ; I have seen him praying thrice in one day .</p>

      <speaker>Second Conspirator</speaker>
      <p>Let us influence the King to make a firm decree that whosoever shall worship any God or man , save the King , for thirty days , he shall be cast into the den of lions .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Third Conspirator</speaker>
      <p>That soundeth well ! If Daniel be faithful to his God , he will surely disobey this decree ; and if the King once signeth it , the law of the Medes and the Persians saith that it cannot be altered .</p>

END CHAPTER X THE DRAMATIZATION OF NEW TESTAMENT PARABLES Many of the New Testament parables present interesting problems for dramatization . The selection should be limited to those which involve dramatic situations and unity of structure . The simplicity and conciseness of words and actions in many of the parables are qualities which call forth a ready and free response from children . Among the parables which have been worked out by the dramatic club are The Good Samaritan , The Wise and Foolish Virgins , The Great Supper , The Talents , The Prodigal Son . In the case of these short parables the story was not told first , but the parable was read to the children directly from the Bible . There was no discussion as to the truths supposed to be taught , the emphasis being placed entirely upon the story element involved . The customs of the times and the division of the story into scenes were discussed as fully as was done with other stories . Usually one or two meetings were all that were necessary for working one of these parables into dramatic form . When it was completed , the result was not a finished product , as the words and action had been interpreted with slight variations each time . The children learned the story by heart , as it is given in the Bible . This influenced their words when they were dramatizing . Several parables were given together at the meeting when parents and friends were invited . One child recited the Bible version just before the play was given . This feature added interest and dignity to the occasion . The parables were given in the following order : THE WISE AND FOOLISH VIRGINS</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Ten virgins with their lamps are waiting for the bridegroom .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>First Virgin</speaker>
      <p>The bridegroom tarries ; let us rest here awhile .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Other Virgins</speaker>
      <p>Yea , let us rest .<stage>They all sit down and go to sleep .</stage>A Cry Without : Behold , the bridegroom cometh ! Go ye out to meet him !<stage>All the virgins get up hurriedly . The five wise ones , with oil in their lamps , stand in readiness . The five foolish ones are in great confusion .</stage>First Foolish Virgin : We have no oil ! Our lamps are gone out ! Second Foolish Virgin<stage>speaking to the five wise virgins</stage>Give us of your oil — we have none . First Wise Virgin : Not so , lest there be not enough for ourselves and for you . But go ye rather to them that sell , and buy for yourselves .<stage>The foolish virgins hasten away .</stage>A Cry Without : Behold , the bridegroom cometh ! Go ye out to meet him !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>The BRIDEGROOM comes in , followed by a few attendants . He walks by , and the five wise virgins follow him . They go in a door which is closed after them . The foolish virgins come hurriedly back and rush to the door . They beat on it and call out several times .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Foolish Virgins</speaker>
      <p>Lord , Lord , open unto us !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>The door opens and the BRIDEGROOM stands there .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Bridegroom</speaker>
      <p>Depart , I know you not ! END During the work on this play the question arose as to the kind of lamps that were used at the time of the story . The children looked up pictures and descriptions , and from these they made themselves lamps out of plasticene or clay . Fig . 8 is a photograph of one of the scenes taken out of doors . The lamps can be seen , also the simple costumes which the children worked out . THE GREAT SUPPER</p>

All begged that thou excuse them . Master<stage>shows great anger</stage>What ! They that are bidden refuse to come to my feast ! Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city , and bring in hither the maimed , and the halt , and the blind !<stage>The MASTER goes into his house , and the servant again walks down the street .</stage>Servant<stage>as he meets the lame , the halt , and the blind</stage>Come ! My Master invites you to a great supper , which is now prepared at his house !<stage>Each person , or group of persons , bows and thanks him with such remarks as</stage>— Maimed , Halt , Blind : We thank thee ; we will be there . We gladly accept this invitation .</p>

      <stage>child Samuel is sleeping near the old priest , Eli . He thinks he hears a voice calling him , and he runs to Eli to ask what he wants . Eli has not called him and tells him to lie down again . Three times he runs to Eli , thinking that he hears him calling . Then the priest tells him that it must be the Lord who has spoken and tells Samuel what to say the next time he is called . Samuel hears the message from the Lord and , upon Eli 's request , tells him what he has heard . Eli realizes that the Lord has spoken truly , and accepts his fate as just . He praises Samuel and tells him that he will soon leave the care of the temple and of the people of Israel to him .</stage>
      <stage>Neither in this play , nor in any other play , should there be an attempt to represent the Lord 's voice . The child may listen as if he were hearing someone speaking , and from what he says and does the audience will be aware of what is happening . For the sake of the result , from an artistic point of view , such parts as this should always be left to the imagination , no attempt being made to interpret them literally .</stage>
      <p>2 . THE QUEEN OF SHEBA 'S VISIT TO SOLOMON</p>
      <p>I KINGS , CHAPTER 10</p>
      <stage>The visit of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon furnishes a unit of work for a short one-act dramatization . There is no plot or complicated situation involved and there is very little activity suggested . The attention of the children may well be directed , however , to the description of Solomon 's court and of the rich gifts which were exchanged . This is an excellent opportunity to have the children do construction work . They should make many things which will help to give the impression of richness to the court . They may also make their own costumes richer by adding jewels and bright-colored sashes and headdresses .</stage>
      <stage>This little dramatization will include many children . A number will be needed to come in with the Queen of Sheba , and there should be many attendants upon King Solomon . The conversation will be for the most part between Solomon and the Queen , heralds and servants making announcements .</stage>
      <stage>The play opens with the Queen of Sheba 's arrival at the court of Solomon . Messengers announce her to the King . Solomon talks with the Queen and she tells him that she admires his great wisdom and his wealth . Then Solomon commands that the feast be served , and while they eat the Queen presents her gifts to Solomon . When the Queen takes her leave Solomon gives her wonderful presents . The play will end with the exit of the Queen and her attendants .</stage>
      <stage>Unless the children put much thought upon the stage setting and the conversation , this incident may prove uninteresting . It has , however , great possibilities for the working out of a beautiful picture .</stage>
      <p>3 . JOSHUA AND THE GIBEONITES</p>
      <p>JOSHUA , CHAPTER 9</p>
      <stage>The story of Joshua and the Gibeonites is so simply told in the Bible that children of nine or ten years of age can read it as it is given and dramatize it directly from that version .</stage>
      <stage>The dramatization of this narrative calls for many characters . The older children may take the parts of Joshua and the leaders of the Gibeonites , while the younger ones are needed for Israelite soldiers and citizens of Gibeon . All the characters in the play will need to do much acting even though they do not enter into the conversation .</stage>
      <stage>Although the dramatization should be a product of the children 's work , yet the leader should have well in mind the three main divisions of the story that she may guide the children by her questions . This story may be worked into one of the more elaborate productions . The Bible language should Be used and the result should be full of dignity and spirit . For detail in the method of presentation compare that employed in the story of Joseph ( chapter iii ) .</stage>
      <stage>The story may be given so that the following divisions or scenes are emphasized :</stage>

      <p>At Gibeon . The Israelite soldiers rush into Gibeon to take it , but find that the inhabitants are the same ragged strangers with whom they made the league . The Israelites reproach them , but cannot go back on their word , so spare their lives . In order to punish the Gibeonites for their deception , Joshua makes them slaves of the Israelites . There is much opportunity for construction work in the dramatizing of this story . Costumes , pieces of armor , and weapons may be made in a simple manner by the children . 4 . ISAAC AND REBEKAH GENESIS , CHAPTER 24 The story of Isaac and Rebekah is unusually valuable for dramatization . It involves a well-worked-out plot which is beautifully and simply told in the Bible , and which brings the children in contact with many interesting customs among the shepherd people . The story needs little changing ; it may be given almost as it is written . The following outline for the divisions of the story is merely suggestive :</p>

      <p>Mesopotamia . The messenger , with his servants , comes to the well just outside of the city walls , where the women draw water . There should be no attempt to represent the camels . These may be indicated by the conversation and left to the imagination . The messenger , through praying to God , decides how he shall know which young woman to choose for Isaac . When Rebekah comes with her pitcher she offers to give water to him and to his camels also . The man is sure then that Rebekah is sent by God , and therefore he arranges to go to her father 's house for the night . This scene should be made very picturesque as well as interesting . The children may look up pictures of the wells of those times and then construct something that will serve the purpose . Pieces of pottery may be brought in on the shoulders of the women to represent water jugs .<stage>Compare with the street scene described in the story of Ruth , chapter vi .</stage></p>

The family finally decide that Rebekah may go back to Canaan , but they ask the servant to let her stay with them for ten days longer . He is unwilling to wait , and the question is therefore put to Rebekah . She answers that she will go with him now .</p>

     <head type="scene">SCENE II</head>
     <stage>The King dreams a dream and forgets it . He calls all of his wise men and demands that they tell him what his dream was and also interpret it . The wise men declare that this is an impossibility and refuse to obey . Nebuchadnezzar is furious and orders that they all be put to death .</stage>
     <stage>Daniel then comes before the King and asks that the King give him time that he may interpret the dream . The King grants this .</stage>
    </div>
    <div type="scene" n="3">
     <head type="scene">SCENE III</head>
     <stage>Daniel appears before the King again . The King asks if he is able to tell what the dream was and to interpret it . Daniel answers that he is able to tell him , not , however , by his own power , but by the power of God in heaven who revealeth secrets . Then Daniel gives in detail the dream and tells King Nebuchadnezzar the meaning thereof . The King is so affected that he falls on his face and worships Daniel . He recognizes the God of Daniel , and commands that Daniel be made governor of Babylon . At Daniel 's request he also makes the three other Israelites rulers of certain provinces .</stage>
     <stage>This story may be treated in the same manner as the story of Joseph ( chapter iii ) .</stage>
     <p>8 . SHADRACH , MESHACH , AND ABED-NEGO IN THE BURNING FIERY FURNACE</p>
     <p>DANIEL , CHAPTER 3</p>
     <stage>This story may be read to children directly from the Bible . After they have worked it over several times the final product will include three scenes of the following character :</stage>
    </div>
    <div type="scene" n="1">
     <head type="scene">SCENE I</head>
     <stage>The heralds come through the streets crying aloud that King Nebuchadnezzar commands all people to bow down when they shall hear the musical instruments and worship the image of gold which he has set up . Those who do not obey will be put into a burning fiery furnace . The instruments of music sound and all the people fall to the ground to worship except the three Israelites , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-nego . Some of the men notice that the Jews do not obey , and go off immediately to tell the King .</stage>
    </div>
    <div type="scene" n="2">
     <head type="scene">SCENE II</head>
     <stage type="setting">
      <stage>The men come before the King and begin their story by saying , “ O King , live forever ! ” The Bible language may be used directly here in the conversation which follows . The King is very angry at what these men tell him . He orders that the three Jews be brought before him . They are brought in and the King tells them that they will have to be put into the fiery furnace if they do not obey . The Jews are not afraid and reply that their God will take care of them . The King then orders them to be bound and to be taken out to the furnace , which has been heated seven times hotter than usual . Men come running back to the King to tell him that the servants which thrust the Jews into the furnace were burnt up by the heat , but that the Jews were not harmed . Another man runs in and tells the King that a fourth person is in the furnace , and that he resembles the Son of God . Nebuchadnezzar commands that the three men be brought out from the furnace . They come before him , with no mark of the fire on them . The King is so greatly impressed that he makes a decree that no one shall speak against the God of Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed-nego . He then appoints these three men to positions of greater trust than ever before .</stage>
      <p>9 . BELSHAZZAR AND THE HANDWRITING ON THE WALL</p>
      <p>DANIEL , CHAPTER 5</p>
      <stage>This story , like the others from Daniel , is so dramatically told in the Bible that it may be taken almost exactly as it is given . It should be worked into a one-act play . Much attention should be given to the setting , and the children may make many things which will give some idea of the richness of the banquet hall .</stage>
      <stage>The play opens with the feast of Belshazzar . The people are making merry in the midst of all the pomp and luxury of the court . Suddenly the handwriting appears on the wall . The King and the people see it and are terrified . The children should not attempt to show the handwriting , but from the words and actions of the King and the people the audience must be made aware of what is happening . None of the wise men present is able to interpret the handwriting . The Queen comes before the King and begs that he send for Daniel , the Jew . Daniel is brought in , and after a little thought gives the interpretation . The scene should end with the recognition of Daniel 's power . The scarlet robe is placed on him and the golden chain is put around his neck , and the King proclaims that Daniel shall be the third ruler in the land .</stage>
      <p>10 . THE STORY OF JOB</p>
      <p>THE BOOK OF JOB</p>
      <stage>The most majestic piece of literature in the Bible , and one of the world 's masterpieces , is the Book of Job . The Prologue and Epilogue are in the prose epic style , which characterizes the best narrative portions of the Bible . The main part of the book is actually dramatic in form , and the deep problem of human suffering is discussed in the loftiest poetic language . The theme is so profound and the imagery so elevated that it is quite beyond the ability of small children . High-school students might well present the drama . Many of the speeches may be abbreviated , while the Prologue can easily be dramatized . Job has been so presented with great success by children of high-school age at All Souls ’ Church , Chicago . It may be noted that the voice of the Lord was given in an elevated monotone by a person unseen .</stage>
      <p>11 . THE PROPHETS</p>
      <stage>For the older children many of the Prophets make interesting characters for dramatization . The great value of a study of the Prophets lies in their appeal as beautiful pieces of literature and expressions of the deepest spiritual feeling , rather than in the dramatic situations presented . If a study is made of the life of the Prophets , and of the times in which they lived , ample material will be discovered which may serve as a background for the dramatization of these characters . This material is not entirely available from the Bible , but should be reinforced by outside references , such as The Prophets of Israel by C. H. Cornill , The Modern Reader 's Bible by R. G. Moulton , The Hebrew Prophets by Chamberlin .</stage>
      <stage>The prophet Amos may be taken as an example of what can be done with this material . The Children of Israel are celebrating their autumn festival with great joy and abandon . As the mirth is at its highest an unknown man makes his way through the crowd . He silences the festivity by chanting his dirgelike reproof to the merrymakers . The astonishment of the people at this sensational interruption is great . The high priest hurries toward him and demands an explanation for this unusual disturbance . He orders Amos to cease speaking and to go back to the hills and mind his sheep . Amos answers that he is sent by the Lord to reprove the people of Israel , and he continues to intone his lamentations . The most beautiful and vivid selections for use in dramatization are found in chapters 8 and 9 . While the final beautiful words of the prophecy are regarded as an editorial appendix , there can be no impropriety in using them as a dramatic climax . The people may then be represented as subdued in spirit , accepting the upbraiding as being the word of God .</stage>
      <stage>Isaiah , Jeremiah , and other Prophets may be worked out in like manner . The result in each case , however , should insure the utmost dignity and beauty ; otherwise the dramatization should never be attempted .</stage>
      <stage>The many Prophets with their various messages suggest the possibility of their use in a pageant . This form of dramatization may be given to advantage by a group of children as a climax to their detailed study of the Prophets .</stage>
      <stage>From each of the following subjects several dramatizations may be taken . They suggest many short one-act plays , and also some excellent long ones .</stage>
      <stage>Saul Chosen and Anointed King of Israel . I Sam ., chaps . 9 and 10 .</stage>
      <stage>Samuel Anoints David . I Sam ., chap . 16 .</stage>
      <stage>David and Jonathan . I Sam ., chaps . 18-20 .</stage>
      <stage>David Spares Saul 's Life . I Sam ., chap . 24 .</stage>
      <stage>Moses Begs Pharaoh to Allow the Children of Israel to Leave Egypt . Exod ., chaps . 5-13 .</stage>
      <stage>It may be well to state , in connection with the selection of stories from the Bible for dramatization , that other stories outside of the Bible may be dramatized by these same methods and will accomplish the same results . It is not best to allow children to dramatize in succession too many of the heavier type of stories , such as the Bible stories represent . They may become tired if they work too long at the same kind of dramatization . Children need stories which will lighten and relieve the extreme seriousness and dignity which they necessarily have to express in playing the Bible stories . There is a host of fairy tales , folk-tales , and historical incidents that may well be adapted for this purpose .</stage>
      <stage>The Children 's Educational Theatre , by Alice Minnie Herts , describes dramatic work with children older than those who made the plays in this book . It is an interesting experiment in education which uses dramatization as a means for accomplishing certain aims .</stage>
      <p>CHAPTER XIII</p>
      <p>STAGE SETTING AND PROPERTIES</p>
      <stage>The point has been emphasized in the preceding chapters that very little stage setting and only a few properties are used in connection with these dramatizations . It is always best that as much as possible should be left to the imagination , and that only such setting and properties be used as the children themselves can construct and as are needed to produce the atmosphere of the play . This point of view influences any consideration of these matters .</stage>
      <stage>It is frequently true that , after the children have made the articles they find a need for , the results are very crude , and there is yet much opportunity for free play of the imagination . Great benefit is derived , however , through the construction of these objects . The children gain a clearer understanding and a keener appreciation of them after they have had the experience of trying to express the shape or form through some medium , such as clay-modeling , paper-cutting , drawing .</stage>
      <stage>Care should be taken that children make nothing in the nature of stage scenery , such as trees , grass , bulrushes , and other bits of landscape . The only stage setting which seems at all necessary for them to make involves very simple designs which show the characteristic ornamentation of the times , for example , the lotus and papyrus designs in Pharaoh 's court .</stage>
      <stage>Drawings and descriptions of a few of the most essential stage properties and settings are given below , with suggestions as to where and how each may be used .</stage>
      <stage>Water jugs and dishes .— In the earlier stages of Hebrew history — as is found to be the case with all primitive shepherd people — skins and wooden bowls were used for holding water , milk , and food . Clay vessels were probably not in general use during the nomadic period . When dramatizing the stories of Abraham and Isaac , and others of that period , this fact should be taken into account , and only vessels of wood and skin should be used .</stage>
      <stage>Most of the clay utensils , which are mentioned in the stories of a later time , were shaped like those shown in Fig . 10 . Many of the water jugs had small handles , though some were without handles . Fig . 11 shows the position in which a Hebrew woman usually carried her water jug .</stage>
      <stage>The Hebrews had little interest in the aesthetic except in the realm of literature , and the lack is very evident in their pottery . The water jugs are far from having the beauty of line and proportion which is found in Greek pottery . Whenever any of these vessels are needed for use in a dramatization , it is well to have the children bring jars and bowls from home which conform as nearly as possible to the shapes here given . Earthenware bowls and jars may be used effectively .</stage>

      </figure>
     </stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Wells .— The importance of wells in the life of the early Hebrews cannot be overemphasized . The scarcity of water in the desert made the digging of wells a necessity for the survival of people and of flocks . As much of the land was rocky , wells could be dug only at certain places . These favorable places were the means of determining where the tents were to be pitched . In most of the stories of the nomadic life wells play a conspicuous part .</speaker>
      <p><stage>Illustration : FIG . 11 .— WOMAN CARRYING WATER JUG</stage>Children should have correct mental pictures of those ancient wells , so that they do not confuse them with the modern wells . The wells of Palestine usually had low stone walls around them , and often big flat stones for covers . The rocks were piled high enough to keep animals from falling in . In some of the wells the water was so low in the ground that people had to go down steps on the inside in order to get it . In other wells the vessels were let down by means of ropes . The women of the land were always required to draw and carry the water . The simplest way for children to represent a well on the stage is by piling up rocks to resemble the outside or by using something that will look like a great stone . Fig . 12 shows two kinds of wells in Palestine .<stage>Illustration : FIG . 12 .— ANCIENT WELLS IN PALESTINE</stage>Staff and rod .— The shepherd boy always had with him a rod and a staff<stage>Fig . 13</stage>The rod was about two and a half feet long and was used for protection . The thick knob at the end was cut out of the tree from which the limb came , and was frequently covered with knots or nails to make it more terrible as a weapon . The children may find pieces of wood which will serve the purpose , or if they live near a forest they may make their own rods . The staff was usually about five feet long . The shepherd used it to help him climb hills and mountains and also to keep the sheep from straying . Some staffs were nothing more than the straight limbs of trees ; others had a fork or crook at the end so that they could more easily catch into the wool of the sheep when they needed guiding . Children may use long sticks or branches from trees when they represent staffs .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Illustration : FIG . 13 .— SPEARS , SWORDS , STAFF , ROD , ARROWS , BOW</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Sling .— The sling which was used in David 's time was frequently woven of rushes , hair , or sinews ; sometimes it was made from soft leather . From Fig . 14 it will be seen that the shape of the woven part is wider in the middle and comes to a point at the end . A string was tied to each end and the stone was placed in the wide part . The sling was whirled around over the head , and as one string was let loose the stone flew out . When the sling is used in a dramatization , the stone may be left to the imagination .</speaker>
      <p><stage>Illustration : FIG . 14 .— A SHEPHERD 'S SLING , A SIMPLE LOOM — MADE FROM CARDBOARD</stage>Children take great pleasure in trying to weave this sling . A diagram of a simple cardboard loom is given in Fig . 14 . The shape should be drawn on the cardboard , then holes made for the thread which strings up the loom . Coarse woolen yarn may be used for the weaving .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Shepherd bag .— The shepherd bag which was used by David was carried by every shepherd boy along with the staff , rod , and sling . It was made from a piece of skin with a cord at each end . The cords were fastened to the girdle so that the skin formed a kind of bag . Pebbles for the sling were carried in it , and often supplies of food . A piece of leather or of brown cloth may be easily made into one of these bags for the children to use .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Sickles .— Sickles were of two kinds — those made of metal and those made of wood . The wooden ones were toothed with sharp pieces of flint . Fig . 15 gives the characteristic shapes .</speaker>
      <p><stage>Illustration : FIG . 15 .— SICKLES</stage>Children may represent these sickles by cutting the shapes from stiff cardboard and coloring them some dark color to make them look as if they were wood or metal . Some of the boys may be interested in cutting sickles directly out of wood .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Scepter .— The scepter was used by kings in the later history of the Hebrews . It was nothing more than a development of the rod used in the shepherd period . As a rod it was a means of protection and power over enemies , and as a scepter it was a symbol of the same power . Scepters were sometimes short , with much ornamentation ; others were long , probably five feet in length . They were all characterized by a ball at the end , and in many cases the kings had them made from gold , or richly ornamented with gold . The Persian kings used the long scepter , which therefore is the kind most appropriate for the play of Esther</speaker>
      <p><stage>see Fig . 16</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Tents .— The ancient Hebrew tent was much like the modern Bedouin tent . It was low and spread out over the ground , and was made of black goat 's hair cloth . This cloth was usually stretched over nine poles , arranged in rows of three and from six to seven feet in height . The inside of the tent was divided into two parts by a long curtain which hung across the middle .</speaker>
      <p><stage>Illustration : FIG . 16 .— SCEPTER</stage>A tent may be represented on the stage by placing a big thick cloth<stage>a blanket or canvas or dark curtain</stage>over poles or screens .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Shields .— There were two kinds of shields found among the Hebrews . One was very large and covered a man from head to foot ; it was usually carried by a shield-bearer . The other was small and was sometimes called a buckler . Many different shapes were found in both kinds of shields ; some were like the Egyptian — long , broad , and straight at the bottom ; others were round and oblong . All shields were convex with handles on the inside to hold them by . The kings had shields covered with gold , or decorated with gold and precious stones ; but the common soldier had a shield of wood or stiff leather . Leather formed the basis of the shields that were decorated . Fig . 17 will show drawings of some of the typical shapes . Children can easily make shields out of cardboard ; some may be covered with gold paper or with dark-brown paper . A handle may be glued or sewed in the inside so that the shield may be held without trouble .</stage>
     <stage>Illustration : FIG . 17 .— SHIELDS , FRONT AND SIDE VIEWS</stage>
     <stage>Swords .— The sword was always hung from the left side of the sword-belt . It was made from bronze or iron , and was about seventeen inches long . Fig . 13 shows some of the usual shapes . Many swords were two-edged and had leather sheaths in which they were carried . Children may make these out of stiff cardboard , or out of thin wood . They should be colored a dark color , and the hilts may be decorated with bright colors to represent jewels .</stage>
     <stage>Illustration : FIG . 18 .— TRUMPETS</stage>
     <stage>Spears .— Spears averaged about five feet in length . The javelin was a long , heavy spear used for casting ; the lance was a lighter spear used for defense . All spears had a shaft of wood and a metal or stone point . Fig . 13 gives several of the characteristic shapes of spear-points . Spears may be made by fastening cardboard points to long sticks , or by cutting the point directly out of the wood . Bows and arrows .— The bows and arrows of the Hebrews were very much like those of all other primitive peoples . The bows were often four or five feet long and the arrows were pointed with sharp flint or metal . Illustrations of the shapes are found in Fig . 13 . Children need little direction in the making of these weapons , a string and some pliable wood being all that is necessary .</stage>
     <stage>Trumpets .— Fig . 18 illustrates the kinds of trumpets used . The small ram'shYpppHeNhorn trumpet was associated with the feasts and other public celebrations , while the long metal horn was used for the most part by the priests . These metal trumpets were frequently made from hammered silver . Children can make them out of stiff paper or thin cardboard and cover them with silver paper .</stage>
     <stage>Illustration : FIG . 19 .— SIGNET RING</stage>
     <stage>Illustration : FIG . 20 .— LAMP</stage>
     <stage>Signet ring .— A signet ring is something that the kings were never without . In the earlier times it was worn on a chain which hung from the neck ; later it was worn on the finger . Fig . 19 gives a drawing of a signet ring . The design was raised so that it left an imprint . The king used this imprint as his royal signature instead of signing his name . When a signet ring is needed in a dramatization , as is the case in Daniel in the Lions ’ Den , any large ring may be used , or the children may be interested in making a ring from paper or cardboard .</stage>
     <stage>Lamps .— Fig . 20 shows one of the simpler types of lamps used at the time of Christ . This was probably the kind referred to in the parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins . The lamps were terra cotta and held a very little oil . Children will be interested in making these lamps out of clay or plasticene . They are almost in the shape of a shallow bowl with a handle .</stage>
     <stage>Illustration : FIG . 21 .— EGYPTIAN DESIGN</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Egyptian design .— In the scenes placed in Pharaoh 's court a few decorations suggestive of the Egyptian will add interest . Fig . 21 gives some of the simpler designs which the children may use for ornamentation . The servants may carry the large fan-shaped designs , which they make on stiff paper . These designs were made from the lotus and the papyrus plants ; the leaves were usually a blue-green , and red , blue , yellow , white , and black were used in many designs . Fig . 21 shows some of these designs that were made by the children and used in representing Pharaoh 's court .</speaker>
      <p><stage>Illustration : FIG . 22 .— HELMETS , CROWNS , ASSYRIAN , EGYPTIAN , EGYPTIAN</stage>As it may be of interest to those who have access to a library to know where more definite and detailed information may be secured concerning the articles that are but briefly described here , the following works are recommended : The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge ; Hastings ’ Dictionary of the Bible ; the Jewish Encyclopedia ; Kitto , Cyclopedia of Biblical Literature ; three books by W. M. Thomson — Central Palestine and Phoenicia , Southern Palestine and Jerusalem , Lebanon , Damascus , and beyond Jordan ; Elmendorf , A Camera Crusade through the Holy Land . CHAPTER XIV COSTUMING The question of costuming may be dealt with in much the same manner as that of stage setting and properties . Costumes are unnecessary in many of the simpler plays , and even where they are used they should be so treated that they are of minor importance in the minds of the children . It is nearly always the case that the very smallest suggestion of a costume — a sash or a cloth around the head — is satisfying and sufficient to produce the proper atmosphere of the play . There is danger of placing so much emphasis upon this phase of the work that the children attach undue importance to it and thus lose the real spirit of the dramatization . If costumes are used they should not be saved for the final performance , but the children should have the pleasure of wearing them at each practice where they are actually living over and over the lives of other people . Children should get their ideas of the dress of the times from pictures and descriptions and then in very simple ways try to represent what they have observed . The simplicity of the costumes among the Hebrew people makes the problem comparatively simple .<stage>Illustration : FIG . 23 .— A group of children , showing costumes and a trumpet</stage>There is very little definite knowledge about the exact costume of the ancient Israelites , for they have left no records . The only sources of information on the subject are the few references to dress in the Old Testament and the few Jewish figures found among the Egyptian , Assyro-Babylonian , and Persian carvings . The conclusion has been reached , however , that the ancient Hebrew costume was in general similar to that of the modern Arab . It is fairly certain that among the earliest tribes a simple slip or short tunic , with close-fitting sleeves , was worn . Later a big loose mantle was usually thrown over this slip . The little under-garment was white , woven from wool , or sometimes made out of skins ; the outer garment was frequently striped , a bright color with white . Among the old patriarchs the outside cloak reached to the ground . It was often in the shape of a blanket , and was draped by throwing one end over the left shoulder , then passing it across the front of the body and under the right arm , then across the back , and to the left shoulder again . At a still later period there was the long gown , which reached to the ankles and was belted in at the waist by a girdle . This was sometimes covered by an outside robe which was like a cape . Frequently these garments were brought over the heads in order to protect their wearers from the sun . As a rule the servants and lower class of people wore only the one garment — a short tunic , with or without a girdle . The richer men wore the outside cloaks . Kings and nobles had many kinds of cloaks which were very elaborately decorated . They had silk girdles , while the poorer men wore leather girdles . See Figs . 23-27 for costumes made by the children .<stage>Illustration : FIG . 24 .— The costume of Abraham</stage>The women 's dress was very much the same as that worn by the men . All garments may have been a little longer , but the draping and the kinds of garments were the same . Great ladies had beautiful veils and shawls .<stage>Illustration : FIG . 25 .— Two kinds of costumes — the Rich Shepherd and the Servant .</stage>Both men and women wore sandals . The soles were made of leather or thick woven cords . They were fastened to the feet by means of strings of leather , linen , or of papyrus . Two straps were usually attached to the back of the sandal , then crossing from the back over the instep they were tied to a third strap which was fastened at the front and came between the great and second toe . Fig . 26 shows sandals which were made by the children .<stage>Illustration : FIG . 26 .— Costumes , showing sandals made by the children</stage>The headdress in the earlier days was nothing more than a piece of square cloth , folded diagonally and placed over the head with the long point at the back ; the two ends were then crossed under the chin and thrown back over the shoulders . A cord was tied around the head to keep the cloth on . Later a kind of turban was worn which had no loose ends , but which projected over the face enough to protect one from the sun . Figs . 23-25 give examples of different kinds of headdress made by the children .<stage>Illustration : FIG . 27 .— Costumes</stage>The crowns which the kings wore were frequently of gold , studded with jewels , although the Persian king had a stiff cap of felt or cloth , encircled by a blue and white band . Fig . 22 gives a few of the typical shapes for crowns . The helmets which were worn by the soldiers were varied . The shapes employed by the Assyrians and the Egyptians were probably used among the Hebrews . See Fig . 22 for drawings of some of the best-known helmets . Children may make these easily by using cardboard and gilt paper . The Hebrew men and women had many personal ornaments , such as necklaces , armlets , bracelets , rings . Children delight in making all kinds of bracelets and chains from gold and silver paper . They may bring all the bright-colored beads that they can get for the enrichment of the costume . CHAPTER XV THE ORGANIZATION OF A CHURCH DRAMATIC CLUB The kind of dramatics described in this book may be undertaken with success in connection with any Sunday school . The most necessary element is a leader in charge who is wide awake to the aims and purposes of such work and who has the ability to deal with little children . A trained teacher is preferable . This dramatization can be most effectively presented to children between the ages of six and thirteen . In case the Sunday school is very large and more children join than can be easily managed by one leader , it would be best to divide the members into two or three smaller groups , each with a competent leader in charge . One person should be able to handle well from twenty to twenty-five children .<stage>2</stage>This training ought not to stop with younger children , but may well be carried on with pupils of high-school age . This would involve problems slightly different from those here presented , but on the whole the same aims may be achieved . It is sometimes the case that a few of the children outgrow the club . They begin to realize that they are much larger than the others , and they decide that they do not care to take part in the acting , yet they are still interested enough to come to the meetings . If there is no other dramatic club into which they may go , then they may be used as assistants in the younger club and made to feel that they are a necessary part of it . There are many ways in which they can be of valuable help to the leader , at the same time experiencing a development through the training . During one year in the history of the dramatic club here described three girls of fourteen came regularly to the meetings . They could not be persuaded to take part in the dramatizations , but they expressed an eagerness to help in the direction . They entered into the discussion and criticism of the plays that were being acted each Sunday , and their suggestions were always very much to the point . They had the ability of explaining what they meant to the children so that it was easily understood . These girls would write out the scenes , sometimes while the children were actually giving them ; or , again , they would write them at home and bring them for discussion at the next meeting . They took entire charge of the costuming , and would meet outside at sewing-bees , where they mended , pieced , or made over the costumes on hand . Then at the plays they always took the responsibility of dressing the little children , putting on their headdresses , tying their sashes , and seeing that their costumes were draped in the right way . When a dramatic club is first started , it is advisable to dignify the organization by electing a president and secretary from among the children . The president may take charge of the meetings and then turn them over to the director , and may help in many ways to keep the club together . The secretary may call the roll and be responsible for sending notices to the members . Children always delight in this amount of formality , and through it each one becomes a much more vital part of the group ; the responsibility as far as possible is placed upon the children , and they usually rise to meet it . It is hardly practical in most cases to attempt to hold more than one meeting a week . The time should be set according to the convenience of the majority of the members . Sunday afternoon was found to be the best time for this little club to meet , but any week day will do as well . Occasionally , just before a play is to be given , a few call meetings may be necessary . It is desirable that the club own the simple costumes which the members wear . A costume box is a convenient place for keeping them . The same garments may be used over and over again , and should be kept where they may be easily obtained at each meeting . The older girls in the group will be glad to take charge of the costume box , and they should see that all of the garments are kept in order . The supply of costumes will grow , for children will be constantly bringing new things to add to it . There are various methods of getting a number of costumes on hand . The children may bring from home old sheets and bright-colored shawls and ribbons , which may be used to advantage . Often the Sunday school will appropriate a small sum in order to help buy materials . A very small amount of money need be spent , for the costumes must be extremely simple and they should be planned and made by the children . The construction work which the children do in connection with the dramatization is an important part in the working out of a play . As already noted , the greatest value of it lies in the fact that it represents the efforts of the children . There is hardly time at one of the regular meetings to have the construction work done . A discussion of the articles needed may be necessary , after which the children should be encouraged to make them at home . The older ones are able to look up pictures and descriptions which will help , while the younger ones need to have the matter frequently talked over in order to give them the correct mental pictures of what they are to make . It is always surprising to see how readily children take hold of this kind of work . They bring in very many interesting things which they have made — often things which they have thought out for themselves and which they had not been asked to make . There are times when all the members are working on the same problem , such as lamps for the Wise and Foolish Virgins . It may be best under these circumstances to have a meeting outside where they all work together .<stage>Descriptions of these constructed articles may be found in a previous chapter .</stage>A word of warning may be in place at this point . Parents of the children are usually anxious and eager to help in making costumes and the constructed objects . The very best aid that they can give is to see that the children have the opportunity for making these things themselves ; they may encourage and guide wisely , but the finished product must be the child 's , not the mother 's . Some mothers have thought that they were doing the right thing to have a carpenter make the spears and other weapons for the soldier . The boy derives more benefit if he looks around for some sticks which will serve his purpose , no matter how crude they may be . The order in which plays are given in this book should not be taken as the proper sequence for a dramatic club . The story of Joseph is described in detail first because the method used there may be followed with any of the shorter or longer stories . This particular story , however , should not be the first one presented to children who have never had such work before . Such stories as David and Goliath , Abraham and the Three Guests , or any of the parables should come first . Joseph , Ruth , and Esther are well worked out by children after they have had a little experience with dramatization . As a final summary , let it be ever kept in mind that this dramatization functions as a factor in religious education only when the highest development of the children is the aim . It should be so conducted that it forms an essential part of the religious training of the Sunday school , and also one of the valuable activities of the church . FOOTNOTES :</p>

     <stage>Footnote 2 : In church schools which are organizing on the most approved methods of the correlation of all educational activities the dramatic club may be a regular part of the junior department , similar clubs being integral parts of the other departments .</stage>
