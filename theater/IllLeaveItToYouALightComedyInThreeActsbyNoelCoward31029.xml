   <set>
    <p>SCENE .— The Hall of Mulberry Manor . All the furniture looks very comfortable . Through the window can be seen a glimpse of a snowy garden ; there it a log fire . The light is a little dim , being late afternoon . Seated on the table swinging her legs is JOYCE , she is attired in a fur coat and goloshes , very little else can be seen , except a pink healthy looking young face . SYLVIA is seated on the Chesterfield R. She is twenty-one and exceedingly pretty . It is about five days before Christmas .</p>
   </set>
  </front>
  <body>
   <stage>JOYCE ( brightly ) . My feet are simply soaking .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( sewing ) . Why on earth do n't you go and change them ? You 'll catch cold .</stage>
   <stage>( BOBBIE enters R. He is a slim , bright-looking youth of twenty . )</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . I do n't mind if I do . ( Laughs . ) Colds are fun .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . She loves having a fuss made of her , beef tea — chicken — jelly with whipped cream — and fires in her bedroom , little Sybarite .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . So do you .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( comes C .) . No , I do n't ; whenever my various ailments confine me to my bed , I chafe — positively chafe at the terrible inactivity . I want to be up and about , shooting , riding , cricket , football , judo , the usual run of manly sports .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Knowing you for what you are — lazy , luxurious ——</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( pained ) . Please , please , please , not in front of the child . ( JOYCE kicks ) . It 's demoralizing for her to hear her idolized brother held up to ridicule .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . You 're not my idolized brother at all — Oliver is . ( Turning away , pouting . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( seated R. on Chesterfield , sweetly ) . If that were really so , dear , I know you have much too kind a heart to let me know it .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . What is the matter with you this afternoon , Bobbie — you are very up in the air about something .</stage>
   <stage>( JOYCE takes her coat off , puts on back of chair R. of table ) .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( rising and sitting on club fender ) . Merely another instance of the triumph of mind over matter ; in this case a long and healthy walk was the matter . I went into the lobby to put on my snow boots and then — as is usually the case with me — my mind won . I thought of tea , crumpets and comfort . Oliver has gone without me , he simply bursts with health and extraordinary dullness . Personally I shall continue to be delicate and interesting .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( seriously ) . You may have to work , Bobbie .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Really , Sylvia , you do say the most awful things , remember Joyce is only a school-girl , she 'll be quite shocked .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . We work jolly hard at school , anyhow .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Oh , no , you do n't . I 've read the modern novelists , and I know ; all you do is walk about with arms entwined , and write poems of tigerish adoration to your mistresses . It 's a beautiful existence .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . You are a silly ass . ( Picks up magazine . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . It 's all very well to go on fooling Bobbie , but really we shall have to pull ourselves together a bit . Mother 's very worried , as you know , money troubles are perfectly beastly , and she has n't told us nearly all . I do so hate her to be upset , poor darling .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . What can we do ? ( Sits L. end of Chesterfield . JOYCE puts down magazine and listens . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Think of a way to make money .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . It 's difficult now that the war is over .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . That 's cheap wit , dear ; also it 's the wrong moment for it . ( JOYCE giggles . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . It 's always the wrong moment for cheap wit , admitting for one moment that it was , which it was n't .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . Oh , do shut up , you make my head go round .</stage>
   <stage>( Enter EVANGELINE downstairs ; she is tall and almost beautiful ; she carries a book in her hand . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( turning ) . Oh , Vangy , do come and join us ; we 're on the verge of a congress .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . I must read some more Maeterlinck . ( Posing . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . You mean you must let us see you reading Maeterlinck .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE ( goes to him , back of Chesterfield , touches his hair . ) Try not to be so irritating , Bobbie dear ; just because you do n't happen to appreciate good literature , it 's very small and narrow to laugh at people who do .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . But seriously , Vangy , we are rather worried ( EVANGELINE moves ) about mother ; she 's been looking harassed for days .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE ( sitting in armchair ) . What about ?</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Money , money , money ! Have n't you realized that ! Uncle Daniel sent a pretty substantial cheque from South America ( all nod ) that helped things on a bit after Father 's death , but that must be gone by now — and mother wo n't say how much father left .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . Perhaps she does n't know .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . She must know now , he 's been dead nearly six months — inconsiderate old beast !</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Bobbie , you 're not to talk about father like that . I wo n't have it ; after all ——</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . After all what ?— He was perfectly rotten to mother , and never came near her for four years before his death . Why should we be charming and reverent about him just because he 's our father . When I saw him I hated him , and his treatment of mum has n't made me like him any better , I can tell you .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . But still , Bobbie , he was our father , and mother was fond of him — ( BOBBIE . Ha ! ) — once , anyhow there 's nothing to be gained by running him down .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . The point is , have we enough money to keep on as we are , or have n't we ?</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE ( quickly ) . The only one who knows is mother , and she wo n't say .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . We have n't asked her yet ; we 'll make her say . Where is she ?</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Up in her room , I think .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Go and fetch her down . ( Puts sewing on form . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . What , now ?</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Yes , now .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Oh , no !</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA AND EVANGELINE . Yes , go along .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Righto ! we 'll tackle her straight away .</stage>
   <stage>( Exit BOBBIE upstairs . )</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE ( goes to EVANGELINE ) . Do — do you think we may have to leave this house ?</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . I do n't know .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . I should simply hate that . ( Sits on right end of form . )</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . So should we all — it would be miserable .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Think how awful it must be for mother .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . I say , do n't you think Oliver ought to be here — if anything 's going to happen ? He 's the eldest .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . He would n't be any help . He cares for nothing but the inside of motors and the outside of Maisie Stuart ; he 's not observant enough to know her inside .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . What a perfectly horrible thing to say !</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Well , it 's absolutely true ; he thinks she 's everything that 's good and noble , when all the time she 's painfully ordinary and a bit of a cat ; what fools men are .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE ( blase ) . One can n't help falling in love .</stage>
   <stage>( Enter MRS. DERMOTT downstairs followed by BOBBIE ; she is a pretty little woman with rather a plaintive manner . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT ( as she descends ) . Bobbie says you all want to talk to me ! What 's the matter , darlings ? ( Comes C .)</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . That 's what we want to know , mum ; come on now , out with it . You 've been looking worried for ever so long .</stage>
   <stage>( BOBBIE stays at foot of stairs . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . I do n't know what you mean , Sylvia dear I ——</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Now listen to me , mother ; you 've got something on your mind , that 's obvious to any one ; you 're not a bit good at hiding your feelings . Surely we 're all old enough to share the worry , whatever it is .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . ( kissing her ) . Silly old darlings — it 's true I have been a little worried — you see , we 're ruined .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . } EVANGELINE . } Mother ! BOBBIE . } JOYCE . }</stage>
   <stage>( The girls rise . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT ( shaking her head sadly ) . Yes , we 're ruined ; we have n't a penny . ( Moves to chair below table . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Why did n't you tell us before ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT ( sitting ) . I only knew it myself this morning , I had a letter from Tibbets ; he 's been through all the papers and things .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . Father 's papers ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . I suppose so , dear . There would n't be any others , would there ?</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( coming down ) . But mother , what did he say , how did he put it ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . I really forget — but I know it worried me dreadfully .</stage>
   <stage>( JOYCE sits on form . )</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . And we literally have n't a penny ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Well , only fifteen hundred a year ; it 's almost as bad .</stage>
   <stage>( EVANGELINE sits in armchair . )</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . Shall we have to give up the house ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . I 'm afraid so , darling ; you see there are taxes and rates and things . Tibbets knows all about it — he 's coming down to-night .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Ca n't Uncle Daniel do anything ?</stage>
   <stage>( BOBBIE sits on table . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . He 's my only hope . I cabled to South America three weeks ago . I did n't know the worst then , but I felt I wanted some one to lean on — after all , his cheque was a great help .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . Is he very , very rich ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . He must be , he 's a bachelor , and he has a ranch and a mine and things .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Has he answered your cable ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . No , but of course he may have been out prospecting or broncho-breaking or something when it arrived . They live such restless lives out there — oh , no , I do n't think he 'll fail me , he 's my only brother .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . I wonder how much he has got .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Perhaps Tibbets will know — we 'll ask him .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Why , is he Uncle Daniel 's lawyer as well ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . No , dear , but you know lawyers are always clever at knowing other people 's business — I shall never forget ——</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Yes — but mother , what will happen if he is n't rich , and does n't help us after all ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . I really do n't know , darling . It 's terribly upsetting , is n't it ?</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . It will be awful having to give up the house .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Well , Tibbets says we need n't for another two years . It 's paid for until then or something .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( sits on the Chesterfield ) . Thank heaven ! What a relief !</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . But we shall have to be awfully careful . Oh , darlings ( she breaks down ) , thank God I 've got you . ( Weeps on BOBBIE 'S knee . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Buck up mother , it is n't as bad as all that . After all , we can work .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( without enthusiasm ) . Yes , we can work . ( Moving from table to R .)</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . I shall write things , really artistic little fragments ——</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . We want to make money , Vangy .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . But , darlings , you know you can n't make money unless you 're Socialists and belong to Unions and things .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . Well , I know I should make money in time . There 's a great demand for really good stuff now .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Do you think yours is really good ?</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . I 'm sure it is .</stage>
   <stage>( MRS. DERMOTT reads a magazine . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Well , God help the bad .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE ( rising ) . Look here , Bobbie , I 'm tired of your silly jeering at me . Just stop trying to be funny . ( Moves to L. C . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( hotly ) . I realize the futility of endeavour when I see how funny others can be without trying ( following her . )</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . Ill-bred little pip squeak !</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE ( jumping up ; firing ) . He 's not a pip squeak . Fanny Harris says he 's the most good-looking boy she 's ever seen .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . She can n't have seen many then . ( Moves to fireplace . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Oh ! Do n't betray your jealousy of my looks , Evangeline . It 's so degrading .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . I tell you ——</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Children , stop quarelling at once . I think it 's most inconsiderate of you under the circumstances .</stage>
   <stage>( BOBBIE sits on table back to audience . There is silence for a moment . Enter GRIGGS from hall with a telegram . )</stage>
   <stage>GRIGGS . For you , madam .</stage>
   <stage>( All show an interest . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT ( taking it ) . Thank you , Griggs . ( She opens it and reads it . ) There is no answer , Griggs .</stage>
   <stage>( Exit GRIGGS , R .)</stage>
   <stage>My dears !</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . What is it , mother , quick ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT ( reading ) . Arrive this afternoon — about tea time , Daniel .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Uncle Daniel !</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . In England !</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . I suppose so . It was handed in at Charing Cross .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . What luck ! ( Gets off table . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . We 're saved — oh , my darlings ! ( She breaks down again . )</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . He may not have any money after all .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . He 'd never have got across so quickly if he had n't . ( She sniffs . ) Oh , it 's too , too wonderful — I have not seen him for six years .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . As a matter of fact it is jolly decent of him to be so prompt .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Where 's Oliver ? He ought to be here to welcome him too .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( C .) . Oliver has gone for a brisk walk , to keep fit he said , as if it made any difference whether he kept fit or not .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . It makes a lot of difference , dear . He is the athletic one of the family . ( BOBBIE is annoyed . ) I do n't like the way you speak of him , Bobbie . We can n't all compose songs and be brilliant . You must try and cultivate a little toleration for others , darling . ( OLIVER passes window from L .) Oliver is a great comfort to me . Tibbets only said ——</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE ( glancing out of the window ) . Here he is , anyhow . Who 's going to tell him the news ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT ( rising , goes to stairs ) . Well , I 've no time now , I must change my dress for Daniel . Turn on the lights , Bobbie ; make everything look as cosy and festive as you can . ( On stairs . ) Run into the kitchen , Joyce dear , and tell cook to make an extra supply of hot cakes for tea . I 'm sure Daniel will love them after being so long abroad and living on venison and bully beef and things . ( Ascending , then turns . ) You will all wash before tea , wo n't you , darlings ? It 's always so important to make a good first impression , and he has n't seen any of you since you 've been grown up . ( Glances in mirror . ) Oh ! look at my face , I look quite happy now .</stage>
   <stage>( Exit MRS. DERMOTT upstairs . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . I think mother is rather mixing up North and South America ; they do n't have such awful hardships where Uncle Daniel comes from .</stage>
   <stage>( Enter OLIVER from hall ; he is a thick-set , determined-looking man of twenty-five . )</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . Hallo ! ( Crossing to table , L. C . )</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE ( going to him , excitedly ) . Something wonderful has happened , Oliver .</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . What is it ?</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . We 're ruined . I 've just got to go and order extra teacakes . Is n't it all thrilling ?</stage>
   <stage>( Exit JOYCE into hall . )</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . What on earth 's she talking about ?</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . It 's perfectly true . We have n't any money , but Uncle Daniel 's coming to-day , and we 're sure he 'll help us .</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER ( dazed ) . Have n't any money , but ——</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE ( at fire ) . Mother 's been rather vague as usual , but we gather that we 're practically penniless , and that we shall have to give up the house after two years unless something happens .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Luckily Uncle Daniel is happening — this afternoon . Mother 's just had a wire from him — he 's certain to be rich , mother says .</stage>
   <stage>( BOBBIE leaning against stairs . )</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . Why ?</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Because he 's a bachelor , and has been living in South America for five years .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Six years .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Five years .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Six years — mother said so .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . No , she did n't ——</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . Well , it does n't matter . How does mother know we 're penniless ?</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( coming C .) . She heard from Tibbets this morning , he 's coming down to-night .</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER ( sinking into chair ) . By Jove , what a muddle !</stage>
   <stage>( JOYCE re-enters , crosses to chair L. C ., takes coat and exits up stairs . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . It 's all quite clear when you think it out .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( C .) . We 've all got to wash and make ourselves look clean and sweet for Uncle Daniel . Your collar 's filthy ; you 'd better go and change it quickly . He may be here at any minute .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Turn on the lights , Bobbie — and do let 's hurry .</stage>
   <stage>( BOBBIE turns up the lights and goes upstairs followed by OLIVER . EVANGELINE goes up slowly after them . )</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . What a muddle ! What a muddle ! ( As he crosses to stairs . )</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE ( following him ) . What a muddle ! What a muddle ! ( Turns on stairs . ) Shall I put on my emerald green tea gown ? ( To SYLVIA . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . No , dear ; it 's ever so much too old for you .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE ( piqued ) . I do n't think it 's at all too old for me . I shall certainly put it on .</stage>
   <stage>( She disappears upstairs . SYLVIA is left alone . Suddenly there comes a loud peal at the front door bell . SYLVIA sees some half-made crepe-de-chine underclothes on form , takes them , hides them under cushions on window seat L. Draws curtains to window L ., then L. C . as enter GRIGGS , followed by UNCLE DANIEL in an opulent-looking fur coat — he is a tall , stoutish man of about forty-five . SYLVIA shrinks back by stairs . )</stage>
   <stage>GRIGGS ( assisting him off with his coat ) . If you will wait , sir , I 'll tell Mrs. Dermott you are here .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Thank you . ( Goes round to fireplace , warms hands , turns . )</stage>
   <stage>( GRIGGS has meanwhile taken his coat into the lobby . SYLVIA creeps cautiously from behind and goes towards stairs . DANIEL looks round and sees her . He watches her in silence for a moment , as she goes up a few stairs . )</stage>
   <stage>Excuse me — have you been stealing anything ?</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( jumping ) . Oh , Uncle Daniel — I did n't want you to see me .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Why not ?</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . I wanted to change my frock and do my hair .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . It looks quite charming as it is — I suppose you are Evangeline ?</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . No I 'm not , I 'm Sylvia . ( Coming to him . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( below Chesterfield ) . Sylvia ! I did n't know there was a Sylvia .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( R. C ., laughing ) . I was having concussion last time you were here , having cut my head open on a door scraper at school . Naturally you would n't remember me .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Oh , but I do now , you were the sole topic of conversation at lunch . How foolish of me to have let you slip my memory . Where are all the others ?</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . They 're upstairs improving on the Almighty 's conception of them as much as possible in your honour ; I was just going to do the same when you caught me .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . You looked extraordinarily furtive .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . And untidy . We 've just been having a sort of family conference . It was very heating .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I think you might have waited for me — I 'm a most important factor . What were you discussing ?</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Oh — er — ways and means .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I see , it 's as bad as that !</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . But you wait until mother comes . She 'll explain everything . I 'll go and hurry her up . ( She goes up stairs . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Do n't leave me all alone . I 'm a timid creature .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( turns ) . After all that Broncho busting ! I do n't think !</stage>
   <stage>( Exit SYLVIA upstairs . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Broncho busting ! What on earth does she mean ? ( He walks slowly to fireplace and stands with his back to it . )</stage>
   <stage>( Enter MRS. DERMOTT down stairs . They meet C .)</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Danny ! Danny ! darling ——</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( C .) . Anne ! ( He kisses her fondly . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Oh , my dear , you have been away such a long time .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( he turns her round to R .) . Well , this is splendid — you do look fit ! Do you know I 've often longed to be home . I 've imagined winter afternoons just like this — with a nice crackly fire and tea and muffins in the grate . ( Pulling her on Chesterfield . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Oh well , they 're not in the grate yet , dear , but they will be soon . I ordered a special lot because I knew you loved them .</stage>
   <stage>( He sits beside her ; she is nearest the fire . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . I can never thank you enough for sending the cheque , Danny .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Oh , rubbish .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . It was the greatest help in the world .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I started for home the very moment I heard you were in trouble ; has everything been very , very trying ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Only during the last few days . You see , George had n't been near me for four years before he died , so it was n't such a terrible shock as it might have been . Of course , he was my husband , and it was upsetting , but still ——</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . He behaved like a beast to you , and ——</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Well , he 's dead now — but do n't let 's discuss my affairs . Tell me about yourself ; what have you been doing ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . That can wait . Considering that the sole object of my coming to England was to help you , I think we ought to concentrate . Tell me now , has he left you very badly off ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Well , Tibbets says we 're ruined , but you know what Tibbets is . Such a pessimist !</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Tibbets ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Yes , our lawyer , you know .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Do I ? How much have you got ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . I think Tibbets said about fifteen hundred ; of course we can n't keep the house and family going on that , can we ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Of course we can n't . What do the children intend to do ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Well , they do n't quite know , poor darlings .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Poor darlings ! Is Oliver at home ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Yes . He 's going to be a barrister or an engineer . He 's very vague about it , but has been learning Pelmanism , so I know he 's going to be something .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I see . Bobbie ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Oh , Bobbie , he 's so young . Of course , it 's not his fault .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Naturally .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . He composes , you know — beautiful little songs ,— mostly about moonlight . Evangeline writes the words . She is very artistic , and ——</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . What does Sylvia do ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Oh , she helps me .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . In what way ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Oh — er — she — well — she does the flowers , and comes calling with me , and she 's invaluable at jumble sales , when we have them .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . And the youngest ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Joyce ? Oh , she 's still at school — she 's going to Roedean next year to be finished .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Finished ? Oh , I see ! Well ! They sound a pretty hopeless lot .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Oh , Danny , how can you be so horrid ? Why , they 're all darlings ! You can n't expect them to work . They 've not been brought up to it .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I think it 's about time they started .</stage>
   <stage>( Enter EVANGELINE down stairs , followed by OLIVER , BOBBIE and JOYCE . SYLVIA comes last . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT ( rising , back to audience ) . Here they are . Children this is Uncle Daniel .</stage>
   <stage>( DANIEL rises , stands L. of Chesterfield . )</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE ( gracefully embracing him ) . I remember you quite well .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Splendid . Evangeline ?</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . Yes , Evangeline . ( Crosses to fire , down stage . )</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER ( shaking hands ) . So do I . ( Moves to above EVANGELINE . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( shaking hands ) . I do n't remember you a bit , but I may later when we all start reminiscencing . ( Goes L .)</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE ( kissing him ) . We 've been simply longing for you to come home .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Little Joyce —— SPACELEFT ( Joyce moves to top of table )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( kissing him ) . D'you know you have n't changed a bit since I last saw you !</stage>
   <stage>( DANIEL smiles at her . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . May I say that it gives me immeasurable joy to be here once more in the bosom of my family . ( Sits on Chesterfield . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . We 're not really your family , but never mind .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I do n't . But I have looked forward to this moment through the long sun-scorched nights with the great dome of the sky above me — shapes have drifted out of the surrounding blackness and beckoned to me , crying “ Home , home ” in depressing voices . I have heard the sand-bug calling to its mate . “ Home , ” it said , and bit me ——</stage>
   <stage>( SYLVIA sits on arm of chair , R. C . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Silly old darling , Danny . ( Sits R. of Chesterfield . )</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . What did you do out there , Uncle ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Lots of things — gold mining , ranching , auction ——</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Auction ? ( Leaning on table . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Is it a very wonderful life , Danny ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Occasionally — on good days .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . How do you mean , good days ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( rather embarrassed ) . Well — er — just good days .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Do come and sit down , all of you ; you look so terribly restless .</stage>
   <stage>( They sit , OLIVER on arm of Chesterfield , JOYCE crosses to form R ., EVANGELINE on club-fender , BOBBIE chair below table , SYLVIA arm-chair . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I feel restless . It must be the home surroundings after all these years .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . I should love to go abroad .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . It would make a man of you , my boy .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . I should simply loathe that .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . So should I between ourselves , but still ——. Oh , by the way , I — I have something rather important to say to you , you must prepare yourselves for a shock — I — I —— SPACELEFT ( He dabs his eyes with his handkerchief . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . What on earth is it , Danny ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I — I —— SPACELEFT ( Another dab . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Oh , uncle , tell us .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I — er — it 's this . I consulted my doctor just before I sailed .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Yes ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . He — he gave me just three years to live .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Danny , what do you mean ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( firmly ) . It 's true — three years , he said .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . It 's the most awful thing . Tell us why — what 's the matter with you ? ( Quickly . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( rather staggered ) . The matter with me ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Yes , of course , you must see a specialist at once .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( pulling himself together dramatically ) . No specialist in the world could ever do me any good .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Well , what is it ? For God 's sake tell us !</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( takes big breath ) . Sleeping sickness ! ( Smiles broadly at MRS . DERMOTT . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . What !! ( They all move . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Yes , it 's frightfully prevalent out there .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Oh , Danny , I hope its not infectious .</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . Sleeping sickness ! By Jove !</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Yes , I simply dare n't go to sleep without an alarm clock .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Danny darling , it 's all too dreadful — I can n't believe it .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( rising ) . But , uncle , I thought sleeping sickness polished you off in one night .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( embarrassed ) . So it does , but that one night wo n't happen to me for three years . The doctor says so . He knows . You see I 've got it internally or something .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT ( firmly ) . You must never go back there — you shall stay with us until — until — the end ——</stage>
   <stage>( She breaks down , sobs on DANIEL 'S shoulder . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( goes behind Chesterfield ) . Oh , mother darling , do n't cry . ( She looks at DANIEL rather angrily . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( rising ) . I 'm sorry I have upset you , Anne . But I have told you this to-day with a purpose in my mind . ( Moving to C .)</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . A purpose ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( L. of arm-chair ) . Yes , I have a few words to say to you all — words which , though they may sound a little mercenary , are in reality prompted by very deep feeling .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Poor Danny .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Ssh ! ( waves her to silence ) . It may seem to all of you “ banal ” in the extreme to talk of money on an occasion such as this , but believe me , it 's best to get it over . I came over to England this time , as I have said , with a purpose — one might almost say a double purpose . Firstly , to comfort my sister , your dear mother , in her hour of — er — tribulation . ( He pauses . ) If you would just say “ yes ” or “ quite so ” whenever I pause , it would help me enormously .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . All right , we will .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Thank you , you are a good girl . Where was I ?</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Tribulation .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . Hour of tribulation ( in his tone . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL. SPACELEFT —— hour of tribulation . ( He pauses . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . } Yes . BOBBIE . } Quite so .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I thank you . And secondly , to feast my eyes , perhaps for the last time on earth , upon you children — also to talk to you seriously , for after all , you 're my only relatives in the world .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . } Yes , yes . BOBBIE . } Quite so .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I am as you may have guessed , a wealthy man ——</stage>
   <stage>EVERYONE ( eagerly ) . Yes , yes ! ( Movement from all . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . And out there ( he nods his head descriptively ) we do n't get much chance of spending our money ——</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . } Quite so . OLIVER . } No , no !</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . And now I come to the point . At the end of three years I shall be no more .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . Quite so !</stage>
   <stage>OTHERS . Sh ! !</stage>
   <stage>( MRS. DERMOTT sniffs . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Bear up , Anne ; we must all die sometime .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Yes , but not of sleeping sickness . It 's so horrible . Anything else — but not sleeping sickness .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I believe it is very comfortable , but that is neither here nor there . What I was going to say was this , I am a firm believer in the old-fashioned laws of entail . I have no patience with this modern way of dividing up legacies between large numbers of people ——</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( with interest ) . Yes , yes ?</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( with equal interest ) . Quite so !</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . When I pass into the great beyond ( MRS. DERMOTT sniffs . He is obviously rather pleased with that remark , so he repeats it ) — pass into the great beyond , I intend to leave the whole bulk of my fortune to the one of you who has made good ——</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . How do you mean “ Made good ” ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I mean make good your position in the world , justify your existence , carve for yourself a niche in the Temple of Fame —— SPACELEFT ( Turning R .)</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( very quickly and brightly ) . Yes , yes ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( turns , sharply ) . That was entirely unnecessary , I did n't pause .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Sorry .</stage>
   <stage>( They are all self-conscious as he addresses them . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . What is the use of idling through life , frittering away your youth , I repeat , frittering away your youth , when you might be working to achieve some great and noble end ? ( OLIVER embarrassed ) You , Oliver , you might in time be a great inventor , and know all about the insides of the most complicated machines . You , Evangeline ( EVANGELINE rises , poses by fireplace , one hand on mantel . JOYCE laughs — she pulls her hair ) , might develop into a great poetess ; your mother tells me that you already write verses about the moonlight . They all start like that , only unfortunately some of them stay like it . ( She sits again . ) You , Bobbie , you are artistic , too , you might without undue strain become a world famed composer , artist , actor . ( BOBBIE rises , moves down L ., posing as actor . ) Sylvia , for you I foresee a marvellous career as a decorative designer . You already arrange flowers and jumble sales — and last , but not by any means least , little Joyce ( JOYCE hangs her head , polishes her nails ) , now on the very threshold of life . What are you going to do with yourself ? Sit at home and wait for a nice husband with mediocre prospects and perhaps an over-developed Adam 's apple ? Never , never ! You too must rise and go forth — the world is calling to you . Do what you will . I can n't think of a career for you at the moment , but no matter . I only want to impress upon you all the necessity of making good at something — make good , make good , make good ! And the one I consider has done best for himself and the family name , to him — or her — I will bequeath every penny I possess . ( Goes up four stairs . )</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER } ( rising and all talking at once ) . But look here —— EVANGELINE . } Uncle dear , of course —— BOBBIE . } How in Heaven 's name are we to —— SYLVIA . } Really I do n't quite see —— JOYCE . } It 's going to be very difficult ——</stage>
   <stage>( All looking towards DANIEL , the positions are now as follows : — DANIEL , up four stairs . MRS. DERMOTT extreme R. SYLVIA up R. C . OLIVER down R. C . EVANGELINE down C. JOYCE up L. C .. BOBBIE down L .)</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( holding up his hand . ) Please — could n't you possibly speak one at a time ? Sylvia ? ( Motions to her . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( stepping forward ) . What we want to know , uncle , is how on earth are we to start ?</stage>
   <stage>( They all nod . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( smiling benignly , arms outstretched ) . I 'll leave it to you !</stage>
   <stage>All turn to audience open-mouthed as the CURTAIN descends .</stage>
   <p>ACT II .</p>
   <stage>The SCENE is the same as Act I. Eighteen months have elapsed . All the windows are wide open . It is a glorious summer day . Alterations in the furniture are noted at the end of the play . At the table L. EVANGELINE is seated when the CURTAIN rises , typewriting slowly but firmly . There are a lot of papers strewn about . On the piano there is a sort of a pastry board to which is affixed a working model of a motor engine in miniature . JOYCE is seated at table L. C . laboriously copying out a sheet of music on to some manuscript paper .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE ( showing music ) . Is it a crotchet or a quaver that has a waggle on the end of it ?</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . I have n't the remotest idea .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . I do think Bobbie might write them a little more distinctly , it 's awfully difficult to copy .</stage>
   <stage>( JOYCE hums . )</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . I do n't wish to appear surly or disagreeable to my younger sister , but if you do n't stop squawking I shall hurl something at you .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . Oh , all right . ( She hums louder . )</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE ( after a short pause ) . Joyce , you really are maddening ; you know perfectly well that I have to revise and retype an entire short story which in itself is a nerve-racking job , and all you do is to burble and sing , and gabble . Ca n't you be quiet ?</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . Why do n't you go and work in your own room ?</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . Because it would be neither comfortable or proper with three inquisitive painters there , running up and down the kitchen steps .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . Oh , I 'd forgotten .</stage>
   <stage>( JOYCE hums again . )</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . But if you desire to continue your noises , may I suggest that you do your music in the summer house . There 's a nice firm table there .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . No thanks , I 'm quite comfy here .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . Well , I 'm sorry to hear it .</stage>
   <stage>( Enter MRS. DERMOTT from hall . Goes to table and tidies papers . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Vangy dear , I do think you might have made the hall look a little tidier . We shall have Mrs. Crombie and Faith here soon . It really is tiresome of Bobbie to have made me ask them , specially as Uncle Daniel 's coming too . They 'll be terribly in the way and we shall have to make conversation instead of listening to Uncle Daniel 's thrilling stories . ( Goes to Chesterfield and tidies papers . )</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . I can n't think why you did n't wire and put them off yesterday .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Because Bobbie would have been miserable and sulky .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . He 's very inconsiderate . I do n't think you ought to give in to him so much , mother ; it only makes him worse . What he can see in that tiresome little cat beats me .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . She 's awfully pretty .</stage>
   <stage>( MRS. DERMOTT merely takes papers from one place to another , frequently dropping some , as she is “ tidying up . ” )</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . And entirely brainless .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . Well , we can be thankful that Mrs. Crombie is n't staying over the week-end . One day of her is bad enough .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT ( tidying papers on form ) . You must n't talk like that , dear . After all they are our guests and Bobbie 's friends , and we must be kind even if we do n't like them very much . ( Picking up waste paper basket from the front of table . ) I 'm only worrying because darling Daniel may be hurt at our having strangers in the house when he arrives .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . Oh , Uncle Dan wo n't mind . He 's probably used to face polar bears and things in his shack .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . But it seems hard luck to leave raging bears on one side of the Atlantic and meet Mrs. Crombie on the other .</stage>
   <stage>( JOYCE goes into screams of laughter and then chokes . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT ( anxiously ) . Darling — do be careful . ( Drops papers and puts waste paper basket through window L. C . Enter BOBBIE downstairs . MRS. DERMOTT continues to tidy up room . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . What 's the matter ?</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . Nothing much , only your crochets and quavers have sent our little ray of sunshine into a rapid decline .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Have you done it ?</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE ( weakly ) . The top treble thing 's a little wobbly , but I 'll ink it over afterwards .</stage>
   <stage>( MRS. DERMOTT is tidying window seat . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( kissing her hurriedly and loudly ) . Thanks , you 're a lamb . I 'll try it now .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . Oh ! Bobbie , do n't try it now !</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . I shall . ( He goes to piano , then turns furiously . ) Well , really it is the limit . Why can n't Oliver keep his rotten engine in the shed . It will scratch all the polish . ( He takes the model off piano and bangs it on to the floor . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Oh , Bobbie , do n't break that thing . Oliver 's so proud of it . I can n't think why .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Well , I wish he 'd go and be proud of it somewhere else . Look here , three distinct scratches .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Never mind dear . Griggs will get them out with sandpaper or something .</stage>
   <stage>( BOBBIE commences to play over the manuscript JOYCE has just copied . Occasionally he stops and alters something with a pencil . No one takes any notice . The dialogue goes on just the same . )</stage>
   <stage>( Coming down to EVANGELINE . ) If you 've nearly finished , Vangy dear , do put the typewriter away . It looks so untidy .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE ( rather crossly , rising ) . Of course I quite see that until my room 's done , I shall never be able to do any work at all . ( Puts cover on typewriter , then pushes table up to back L .)</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Do n't be cross , darling . You know how worried I am over everything this morning . It 's one long rush .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE ( kissing her ) . Sorry dear . I quite understand , only I must have this story sent to the Clarion by Tuesday . If not , it wo n't be out until the August number .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . You 're a dear darling , and you work terribly hard . I only hope you wo n't overdo it .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . Oh no , these stories are only pot boilers . They just fill in the time until my next novel is ready .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( suddenly . ) . Listen , do n't you think this is a ripping change ? ( He plays a few chords . He then sits back complacently . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Perfectly lovely , darling .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . It sounds very much like everything else to me .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Only because you have n't got any ear . As a matter of fact they 're quite good chords . I shall put them into the new tomb-stone cycle .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . Do n't alter many of my words , will you ?</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Not many , but the bit about “ worms gnawing the grave of my beloved ” is a little too gloomy . Could n't you make it butterflies ?</stage>
   <stage>( JOYCE giggles . )</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . Do n't be silly , Bobbie ! butterflies do n't live in graves . Well , you can use the first two verses as they are .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . I will .</stage>
   <stage>( He starts to play again , MRS. DERMOTT is just going towards the stairs when there comes a ring and knock at the front door . )</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE ( rising ) . My goodness , the Crombies — I must go and wash . I 'm covered in ink . ( Going to stairs . )</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE ( down L. of table ) . I should n't worry , dear , they 'll be so overdressed themselves they will amply make up for any deficiencies in our appearances .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . I think I 'd better go all the same . I must do my hair .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Do n't dazzle them too much , dear .</stage>
   <stage>( Exit JOYCE upstairs . GRIGGS crosses in corridor to open front door . )</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE ( going to corridor ) . I 'll be in presently , mother . I 've left my note-book in the summer house , and I 'm afraid of forgetting it .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( still at piano ) . You 'll meet them on the doorstep .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . No , I sha n't . I 'm going through the drawing room window .</stage>
   <stage>( Exit EVANGELINE , R .)</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT ( C .) . Really it 's most inconsiderate of her to leave me alone like this . Bobbie darling —— SPACELEFT ( BOBBIE crosses to her , kisses her . )</stage>
   <stage>( Re-enter GRIGGS . )</stage>
   <stage>GRIGGS . Mrs. Crombie , Miss Faith Crombie .</stage>
   <stage>( Enter MRS. CROMBIE , and FAITH . MRS. CROMBIE is a well-preserved , rather flashy woman . FAITH is a very pretty girl , perhaps a shade too self-assured . She is all right when by herself , but when compared with the Dermott girls , there is obviously a little something lacking . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT ( going to her , drops quantity of papers ) . I 'm so glad you were able to come , dear Mrs. Crombie . How are you , Faith dear ? ( FAITH giggles , goes down to Chesterfield . ) I do hope you were n't too shaken up in the Ford , but Sylvia has taken the car up to Town to meet my brother .</stage>
   <stage>( BOBBIE kicks papers up stage , then moves to bottom of table . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE ( up R. C . ) . Not at all , we did n't expect to be met at all . It 's such a little way . Well , Bobbie , have you been writing any more successes ?</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( laughing ) . I think I 've done one or two bad enough to be good .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Oh , mother , is n't he cynical ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT ( C .) . He always talks like that . Fancy , he says his Rose song is bad . Fancy that wonderful Rose song . I 'm always humming it . ( Hums few notes of “ The Rosary , ” BOBBIE attempting to stop her . ) Well , I forget it now , but I love it .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH ( down R .) . I love it too .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( down L .) . Do you really ?</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Of course . ( Moves to piano . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Now then , shall we all go out into the garden ? Oliver and Vangy are somewhere about . We always sit under the big cedar in the afternoons . It 's so beautifully shady .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE ( walking towards door with MRS. DERMOTT ) . I envy you your garden so much , Mrs. Dermott . I have about two rose bushes and a tennis net . Faith insists on that .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . You 're lucky even to have a small garden in London .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE ( as they go off ) . Yes , I suppose we are , you see ...</stage>
   <stage>( Exeunt to garden . )</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Come on , Bobbie . ( Coming C .)</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . No , stay here and talk to me . ( Goes to her and takes her hand . )</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Mother will only come back and fetch me .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . No , she wo n't . They 're both jawing quite happily . I have been so looking forward to to-day .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . So have I .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . I was terrified that you 'd wire or something to say you could n't come .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Silly Bobbie .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Do you realize it 's a whole week since I 've seen you . ( Dropping her hand . ) I 've got something for you .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH ( eagerly ) . What is it ?</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . A song .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH ( without enthusiasm ) . Oh .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Shall I play it ?</stage>
   <stage>FAITH ( moves to R. of table . ) Yes , do .</stage>
   <stage>( Enter JOYCE downstairs . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Damn .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . Hullo , Faith , how are you ? ( They kiss . ) Come and play a single with me .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( at piano ) . Oh , do go away , Joyce . I 'm just going to play her a song — her song .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . My song ? ( Sits R. of table . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . I wrote it specially for her .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . Are n't you lucky ? Well , come out presently when you feel you 're rhapsodized enough . ( Crosses to corridor . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Oh , do shut up , Joy , and go away .</stage>
   <stage>( BOBBIE starts to play . )</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . All right , keep calm . ( Exits and re-enter . ) Have you seen my racquet ?</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . No .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . Oh , thanks , dear , for your kind help . Sorry I came in at the wrong moment .</stage>
   <stage>( Exit JOYCE brightly . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Young sisters are a nuisance sometimes .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH ( giggling ) . They must be .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Listen ...</stage>
   <stage>( FAITH reads magazine and takes no notice of song . He plays and sings a short love song . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . There ! Do you like it .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH ( putting magazine down — ecstatically ) . Oh , Bobbie , that 's simply too sweet for words . It has a something about it — did you really write it for me ?</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( ardently ) . Every note .</stage>
   <stage>( BOBBIE plays a well-known and hackneyed song . )</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Bobbie ! that 's wonderful ! Wonderful !! It 's the best you 've ever done . Now I know you are clever .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( coming C .) . Yes ! but I did n't write that one .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH ( goes to him ) . Oh ! did n't you . Well , I know you would if you had thought of it — but never mind ——</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Can you play the Indian Love Lyrics — I never get tired of them !</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . I do n't want to play any more , I want to talk to you .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . What shall we talk about ?</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . I could tell you such wonderful things — but I do n't know whether you would understand .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH ( pouting girlishly ) . That 's not very polite . ( Coming down between armchair and Chesterfield . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . I mean that you would n't understand unless you felt like I do . Oh , I do n't know how to put it — but do you ?</stage>
   <stage>FAITH ( coyly ) . Do I what ? ( Sits L. of Chesterfield . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( by armchair — desperately ) . Feel as if you could ever care — even a little bit — for me ?</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . I have n't tried yet .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Well , will you try ?</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . I must ask mother .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( in anguish — moving slightly C .) . Ask mother ! But that 's no use . Why , my mother could never make me care for someone I did n't want to , or not care for some one I did . Do n't you see what I mean . If you are ever going to care for me you will have to do it on your own . Love is n't a thing to be ordered about at will . Love is wonderful — glorious , but above all , it 's individual — you can n't guide it . Why , you might fall in love with a taxi driver or a dope fiend ——</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Mother would never allow me to know a dope fiend .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( L. of Chesterfield — firmly ) . But if you did , your mother 's opinion would n't have any effect at all — not if you had it in your heart — really and truly .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Mother 's disapproval might stop me falling in love .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . No , it might n't — nothing could stop it . On the contrary it would probably strengthen it ; opposition always does .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH ( doubtfully ) . Do you think so ?</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . I 'm sure of it , but anyhow , I 'm going to tell you something .</stage>
   <stage>( MRS. DERMOTT appears at window L. C . with telegram . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Bobbie , darling ——</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( irritably ) . What is it , mother ? ( Goes up to window . )</stage>
   <stage>( FAITH powders her nose , etc . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . I 've just received the oddest telegram . We met the boy in the drive . Do listen , I can n't understand it . ( She reads . ) “ Come to lunch Monday and discuss Royalties — Claverton . ” What does it all mean ?</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . It 's not for you , it 's for Vangy . Claverton 's her publisher .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . What on earth do they want to discuss Royalties for . It sounds so snobbish .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( laughing ) . Mother , at times you 're inimitable . Royalties means money , so much per cent ., you know . We 've explained it heaps of times .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Of course , dear , how stupid of me ; but still it is very muddling , when they call things by fancy names like that . Put it on the mantelpiece and give it to Vangy when she comes in .</stage>
   <stage>( She disappears . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Mother never will grasp the smallest technicality .</stage>
   <stage>( Coming down to fireplace , he puts the telegram on the mantelpiece . )</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . You were going to tell me something .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Yes , I know something that will banish your mother 's disapproval altogether ....</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . She has n't disapproved yet . I only said she might .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Well , she 's pretty certain to want you to make a good match . I know what mothers are , they all do . I 'm not a good match I know , but what she does n't know is that I have wonderful prospects .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH ( with interest ) . Have you ?</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . I should never have proposed to you , otherwise .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Well , you have n't proposed properly .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . I mean to when I 've told you everything . Will you listen ? ( Moves to R. of Chesterfield . )</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Of course .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Well , have you ever met my Uncle Daniel ? ( Sits by her on Chesterfield . )</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . No .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . You will to-day , he 's a wonderful chap . Eighteen months ago his doctor told him that he only had three years to live . ( FAITH giggles . ) And the day he came over from South America he gave us all a jolly good talking to — quite right too .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Why ?</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . You see father had left mother badly off , and we were all drooping round doing nothing .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Of course !</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Then Uncle Dan turned up and said he 'd leave his whole fortune to the one of us who made good in some way or other . Of course that bucked us up no end , and look at us now — Vangy 's raking in the dibs with her novel , Sylvia 's on a fair way to be a big film star , Oliver has just been made assistant manager at the motor works , which is a good leg-up considering that he started as an ordinary mechanic . I 'm doing jolly well out of my songs — specially “ The Rose of Passion Sweet . ” Why they buy the beastly thing I do n't know . It 's the worst of the lot .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Oh ! Bobbie !</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Even Joyce has walked off with all the prizes at school and intends to be a great artist . You see we 've all risen to the bait . Eighteen months ago it seemed providential that Uncle should only have such a short time to live , now I rather hate it , in spite of the money . He 's a dear , though of course we did n't see much of him . He went back to South America soon after he 'd seen us , but still he left an impression . Here we are , all working like slaves , and helping mother to keep on the house . It would have broken her heart to have given it up . There are my prospects — a huge fortune , quite soon .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Yes , but , Bobbie , one of the others might get it .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( after looking round ) . Ah , but there is just one more thing to tell you . Two days before he sailed Uncle Dan took me aside and told me — in the very strictest confidence of course — that I was the one out of us all that he had his eye on ; he said he 'd practically made out his will in my favour already ....</stage>
   <stage>FAITH ( ecstatically ) . Bobbie !</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Yes , but promise you wo n't breathe a word to the others ; of course you understand he could n't show favouritism openly .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . No — I see .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Now that I have told you everything , Faith darling , will you — will you marry me ?</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Yes , Bobbie —</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Oh ! ( He kisses her . )</stage>
   <stage>FAITH. SPACELEFT — if mother says I may .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Oh ! ( mastering slight irritation ) . But do n't you think she will , now ?</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Yes , I think so .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( sadly ) . I do n't believe you love me a bit .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH ( filled with reproach ) . Oh , Bobbie , how can you .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Well , do you ?</stage>
   <stage>( MRS. CROMBIE sees them through window L. C . )</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Of course , silly ! ( She kisses him . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( joyfully — taking her hands ) . Oh , Faith we 'll have the most wonderful times in the world — just you and me together ; say you 're happy , say you 're excited about it .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . I 'm absolutely thrilled — I 'm —— SPACELEFT ( BOBBIE sees MRS. CROMBIE . Picks up papers on floor to hide his confusion . )</stage>
   <stage>( Enter MRS. CROMBIE . They get up . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE ( going L. C . ) . You ought to be ashamed of yourselves , sitting indoors on a lovely day like this . ( FAITH giggles . ) Heaven knows we get little enough good air in town , without wasting it when we get into the country .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Mother , something important has happened . ( By front of couch . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( sincere ) . Look here , Faith , you must let me tell her — it 's my job , I wo n't shirk it .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Do n't be silly , Bobbie , go into the garden , there 's a darling — I 'll come out in a minute or two .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . But — but ——</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Do be sensible .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Oh , all right .... ( Goes up between Chesterfield and fireplace , and exits into garden . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . You are a little fool , Faith . Fancy flirting with that — the elder one has much more in him .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . But I do n't like Oliver so much , his chin 's so scrubby .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . Oliver is a steady man with an assured career in front of him — this one ——</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Mother , we 're engaged !</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . Of course you are . That has been perfectly obvious from the moment I passed the window . Now of course we have all the trouble of getting you disengaged again . Really you are very tiresome . ( Below table . )</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Mother , how can you be so horrid , you will not understand ! Bobbie has ever so much better prospects than Oliver .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . Who said so ? Bobbie ?</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Yes , but it 's true ; his Uncle is going to leave him a huge fortune in a year 's time .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . Which Uncle ? ( Takes out cigarette from case . )</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . He 's only got one — Daniel Davis . He landed in England yesterday , and is coming down here to-day . Eighteen months ago the doctor said he only had three years to live ——</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . I 've been caught like that before . ( Crosses to mantelpiece for matches . )</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Why , how do you mean ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . Experience has taught me one thing , and that is that in this world people never die when they 're expected to . ( Sits on Chesterfield . ) The old man will probably live to a ripe old age , then where would you be ?</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Well , anyhow Bobbie makes quite a lot out of his songs . ( Sits in armchair . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . Do n't be childish , Faith . You know perfectly well I should never allow you to marry a man without a settled income — prospects never kept anyone . Besides , if any of them get the uncle 's money it will be Oliver — he 's the eldest . ( Lights cigarette . )</stage>
   <stage>FAITH ( in chair L. C . ) . That 's where you are wrong , mother . Just before he sailed back to America , he took Bobbie aside and told him in confidence that he was the one he meant to leave everything to . Of course the others must n't know because it would be favouritism — do n't you see ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . How much is he going to leave ?</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . I do n't know , but it 's sure to be a lot .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . Why ?</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Well , he 's a bachelor and — and he 's been mining in South America .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . There are hundreds of bachelors in South America who are absolutely penniless — whether they mine or not .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . You are horrid , mother . ( Sniffs . ) I did feel so happy , and I wanted you to be happy too .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE ( with slight sarcasm ) . It was sweet of you , dear . I really can n't work myself up to a high pitch of enthusiasm over an uncle who though apparently in the last throes of a virulent disease is well able to gallop backwards and forwards across the Atlantic gaily arranging to leave an extremely problematic fortune to an extremely scatter-brained young man .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Bobbie is n't scatter-brained .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . The whole family is scatter-brained , and I expect the uncle 's the worst of the lot — he would n't have been sent to South America otherwise .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . He was n't sent , he went .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . How do you know ? He probably did something disgraceful in his youth and had to leave the country . Just like my brother , your Uncle Percy . I 'm certain there 's a skeleton of some kind in this family — anyhow he 's sure not to die when we want him to .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . The doctor said three years .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . Only to frighten him , that 's what doctors are for . I believe they cured hundreds of cases in the army like that .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Did they , mother .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . What 's the matter with the man ?</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . I do n't know .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . It strikes me , dear , that you had better find out a bit more before you get engaged another time .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH ( tearfully ) . But I do n't want to be engaged another time . I want to be engaged this time . Oh , mother darling , wo n't you wait a little while ? Just see the uncle . If you got him alone for a while you could find out anything — you 're always so clever at that sort of thing . Oh , mother , do .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . I 'll interview the man on one condition . That is that whatever decision I may make you promise to abide by it afterwards .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH ( rises ) . Yes , mother , I promise . ( Kisses her , remains below fireplace . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . Now I suppose we had better join the rest , they 're being feverishly bright on the tennis lawn .</stage>
   <stage>( Enter MRS. DERMOTT followed by EVANGELINE . MRS. DERMOTT motions to EVANGELINE to pick up papers , who does so , placing them on table . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Ah , there you are , Mrs. Crombie ; you were bored with watching tennis too . Of course Oliver and Joyce 's efforts cannot really be called tennis , but still it 's an amusement for them . ( Sits in armchair . ) Have you seen my knitting anywhere , Vangy darling ? I 'm certain I left it here .</stage>
   <stage>( FAITH sits on form R .)</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . You had it in the drawing-room before lunch . I 'll go and look .</stage>
   <stage>( Exit EVANGELINE R .)</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Thank you so much , dear . You know , Mrs. Crombie , I imagined that all authors became terribly superior after a little time , but Vangy has n't a bit — it is such a relief to me .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . I have n't read her book yet ; I must really order it from Boots .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Oh , you belong to Boots too , I did for years — there 's something so fascinating in having those little ivory marker things with one 's name on them , but , of course , I had to give it up when the crash came .</stage>
   <stage>( Re-enter EVANGELINE with knitting . )</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . Here you are , mother . ( Crosses to below table . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Thank you so much , darling . Do you know , Mrs. Crombie , I started this at the beginning of the War and I have n't finished it yet ? I do hope you are not being terribly dull here , Mrs. Crombie . ( Drops ball of wool . ) I 'm afraid we 're awfully bad at entertaining .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . Not at all . You are one of those excellent hostesses who allow their guests to do as they like , it 's so much more comfortable .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH ( rising ) . I think I 'll go and talk to Bobbie in the garden .</stage>
   <stage>( Goes between Chesterfield and armchair . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Do dear , I 'm sure he 'd love it . ( Kisses her . FAITH giggles . )</stage>
   <stage>( Exit FAITH . )</stage>
   <stage>( During following scene MRS. DERMOTT gets into complications with knitting . EVANGELINE settles herself L. with illustrated paper . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Your daughter is a dear girl , Mrs. Crombie — we are all so fond of her .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . It 's charming of you — she simply loves being down here . Of course it is so good for her to get away from London for a little while .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . I only wish we could have put you up as well , but really with all the children at home , there 's no room at all . I was only saying to Tibbets — my solicitor , you know — that the one thing ——</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . I understand perfectly . Anyhow , I can never leave my husband for long — men are so selfish , are n't they ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Sometimes I 'm afraid , but still they 're rather darlings when you know how to manage them . Vangy , dear , did I tell you how many stitches I set on this sleeve ?</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . We have many confidences , mother , but that is not one of them .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Dear me , how tiresome . I 'm certain I told someone .</stage>
   <stage>( She gets up and rings bell above fireplace , and sits down again . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . I was saying , Miss Dermott , that I must make an effort to get your book from the library .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . Oh , there are one or two copies in the house — I 'll lend you one .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . It 's very kind of you .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . I 'm sure you 'll like it , I did , though Vangy tells me I did n't understand half of it . Naturally being my daughter 's work it thrilled me , though where she got all her ideas from I can n't think — I 've always been most careful with the children 's upbringing ——</stage>
   <stage>( Enter GRIGGS , R. and moves to above Chesterfield . He coughs . )</stage>
   <stage>What is it , Griggs ?</stage>
   <stage>GRIGGS . You rang , madam .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Did I ? Now what on earth could it have been ? Was it a flustered ring , Griggs , or just an ordinary calm one ?</stage>
   <stage>GRIGGS . Quite calm , madam .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT ( in anguish ) . Oh , Vangy dear , what did I ring for ?</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . You said something about your knitting just before .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Oh , of course , yes . Griggs , do you know how many stitches I cast on for this sleeve ?</stage>
   <stage>GRIGGS . Forty-seven , madam .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Oh , thank you so much — you 're quite sure ?</stage>
   <stage>GRIGGS . Quite , madam , but if I might suggest it , next time an even number would be easier to remember .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Yes , Griggs — remind me , wo n't you ? You 're a great help .</stage>
   <stage>GRIGGS . Yes , madam .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Thank you , Griggs .</stage>
   <stage>( Exit GRIGGS , R .)</stage>
   <stage>Really , I do n't know what I should do without that man . I believe he 's Scotch , but he 's quite invaluable .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . So it seems .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . Will Sylvia and Uncle Daniel be here in time for dinner , mother ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Yes , his train arrived at Euston at eleven-thirty . They ought to be here quite soon now , unless , of course , anything has happened to the car — but still , Sylvia drives very carefully . They taught her to do lots of things like that on the films , you know — they 're awfully daring — I shall never forget when they made her jump off Westminster Bridge on a horse — my sister Amy was scandalized , and I said ——</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . I can quite imagine it . It was very plucky of your daughter to do it , though I 'm glad Faith is n't on the films — I should be worried to death .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Of course I felt like that at first — but one gets hardened to anything — even my poor brother 's approaching death seems less terrible now — at the time when he told us it was a fearful shock , but somehow ——</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . It must be terribly sad for you . Faith told me about it this morning . What is he suffering from ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Well , to tell you the truth , we do n't quite know , he will joke about it so — at first he said it was “ Sleeping Sickness ” and then “ Creeping quickness ” or pneu-somnia or something or other — one comfort , he does n't seem to mind a bit .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . Perhaps the doctor diagnosed the case all wrong .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Oh yes , they are careless — are n't they ? Did you say “ diagnosed , ” there now , that 's the word you were trying to think of the other day for your short story , Vangy . I knew it was dia —— SPACELEFTsomething .</stage>
   <stage>( Enter OLIVER and JOYCE from garden — followed by FAITH and BOBBIE . )</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . I won a sett . ( Goes to chair L. of table past . )</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . Only because I had the sun in my eyes .</stage>
   <stage>( OLIVER puts racquet on piano . )</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . Well , I offered to change over , but you would n't .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . What time will Sylvia and your uncle arrive ?</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER ( sitting on top of table ) . They ought to be here any moment now , unless Sylvia 's bashed up the bus .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( above Chesterfield to MRS. CROMBIE , admiringly ) . Is n't he technical , the way he uses all the right expressions — it gives one such a professional air to call cars “ buses . ”</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . It 's very muddling .</stage>
   <stage>( A motor horn is heard . )</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE ( rushing to window ) . Here they are .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . I wonder how Uncle Daniel is .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE ( rising ) . You must all be wondering that . ( Goes to table powdering . ) Faith , I shall go soon . I 'm sure this man is going to be simply odious .</stage>
   <stage>( All except MRS. CROMBIE and FAITH go out to meet DANIEL . All enter together talking about their various professions . BOBBIE to fireplace ; OLIVER behind table ; SYLVIA up stage ; JOYCE to form ; EVANGELINE above fireplace ; MRS. CROMBIE below table ; MRS. DERMOTT C .; DANIEL L. C . ; FAITH R. of table . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Oh , Danny , darling — let me introduce you to Mrs. Crombie — my brother . And this is Faith — such a dear girl .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . How do you do . I 've heard so much about you . Are you feeling better ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( L. C ., jovially ) . Better ! Why , I never had a day 's illness in my life — ( look from all ) — at least — that is until I had the illness . Yes , it 's very tiresome . ( He gulps . ) A short life and a gay one , you know . ( He laughs forcedly . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Danny , darling , I do hope ——</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Nonsense , dear — there is no hope — but that 's a comfort to me . I always imagine hope weary after a game of blind man 's buff sitting on an orange — so uncomfortable .</stage>
   <stage>( MRS. CROMBIE and FAITH sit below and R. of table respectively . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT ( sits Chesterfield , dabbing her eyes ) . Really , Danny , you are too absurd .... I 'm so glad Sylvia brought you safely , I never really feel happy in my mind when she 's out with the car . It 's not really woman 's work .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( sitting armchair ) . As far as I can gather from what she has been telling me — filming seems to require a certain amount of unwomanly abandon !</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( at back of Chesterfield , laughing ) . I was only telling him about that day in the middle of the village street , when I had to do three “ close ups ” on top of one another .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . It all sounds vaguely immoral to me , but I hope it 's all right .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Define the expression “ close up . ” What does it mean ?</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . When they bring the camera right up to your face and you have to register various emotions — fear — suspicion — joy — yearning — sorrow — ( she does them ) that 's a close up .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Is n't she wonderful ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . It really is most entertaining .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I think they ought to film Evangeline 's novel — it 's chock full of incident .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE ( rising , poses by mantel ) . Yes , uncle , but only psychological incident — they want luridly exciting episodes for a real thriller . I mean to write a scenario one day though , it 's a money-making game . ( Sits again . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Do , dear — but please do n't make the heroine jump out of attic windows or anything — it is so trying for Sylvia — I shall never forget Westminster Bridge and that horse .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . It appears to be a most dashing profession .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT ( with pride ) . Oh , it is . Sylvia does the most thrilling things , I assure you . She had to rescue the Rajah from a burning house in Piccadilly only last Wednesday . It caused a great sensation .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . So I should imagine , but why was the Rajah burning in Piccadilly ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Oh , it was n't a real Rajah of course — but he was supposed to be in the clutch of Bolshevists — or was that another film , Sylvia ?— I get so muddled ——</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . It was another film , mother , but it does n't matter . How 's your illness , Uncle Dan ? You look pretty bright .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Oh , I expect to be quite cheery right up to the last .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Oh , Danny dear , do n't talk about it .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( with meaning ) . I always think we attach too much importance to life and death .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE ( acidly ) . It depends on circumstances , of course .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( dramatically ) . Out there where I come from ——</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . Go on , uncle , do tell us .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I was just going to , only you interrupted me — out there on the limitless prairie , a man 's life is not considered worth that much . ( He tries to snap his fingers without any success . ) There now , I can never do that properly — that much . ( He tries again . ) Damn !</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . I can do it , uncle . ( He does it . )</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . So can I . ( She tries . ) Oh , no I can n't — Sylvia , you can . You had to when you were playing in “ Spanish Passion . ”</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Never mind now , let uncle get on with his story .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Out there Death waits round every corner ——</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . I did n't know there were any corners on the limitless prairie .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( testily ) . I was millions of miles away from any prairie — and , anyhow , I was only speaking metaphorically .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . You are irritating , Bobbie , why can n't you keep quiet .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . There seems to be some doubt , Mr. Davis , as to what part of America you were in .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . South America — firmly South America — in the little tiny wee , bijou village of Santa Lyta — far away from the beaten track , this lonely place lies basking in the sun . Heavens , how it basked ! its natives care-free and irresponsible , dreaming idly through the long summer heat ——</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . What did you do there , uncle ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Eh ?</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . What did you do there , uncle ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( coming to earth ) . Oh , er — lots of things — fishing — yachting .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . But I thought it was inland .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Eh ?</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . I thought it was inland .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . So it is , but there 's a lake , there 's a lake ! We used to sit round the camp fire in the evenings and cook the fish — yes , salmon and cucumber , and sing songs — sweet little homely ditties — your Rose song in particular , Bobbie , was a great success , I must say that ——</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Do n't perjure yourself , uncle , I know perfectly well that it 's the worst thing that has ever been written .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . It 's your most successful .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Of course — I 've made literally hundreds out of it — the public wallow in it — roses and passion , and wine , and eyes of blue — it makes me absolutely sick every time I hear it , but still one must write down in this world if one wants to get up .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Speaking of roses , let 's go out into the garden and talk — it 's so stuffy in here — you can tell me some more of your adventures , Danny .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( looking at him ) . I 'm sure he 'd love to .</stage>
   <stage>( Every one gets up and drifts out on to the lawn talking . BOBBIE hangs behind for a moment with FAITH . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( anxiously ) . What did she say ? ( Catching her hand as she is going out . )</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . She said she 'll see — wait until to-night ....</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Oh , Faith darling ....</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Come out now , quick , or they 'll miss us .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( grumbling ) . It does n't matter if they do .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Oh , yes , it does — I do n't want to be talked about .</stage>
   <stage>( They go out and bang into DANIEL , who is coming in . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Hallo , are n't you going to tell us things ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( comes C .) . No , not now — I must unpack — I 'm feeling rather tired — I have to change — I must send a wire .... The truth of the matter is , I just want a little peace .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . All right , we 'll leave you to it .</stage>
   <stage>( Exit BOBBIE and FAITH . DANIEL comes slowly down stage — lights a cigar and settles himself in Chesterfield . )</stage>
   <stage>( Re-enter SYLVIA , quickly touches DANIEL on face — he jumps . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Uncle dear , why did you slip away ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I explained to your brother — because I felt a little tired and wanted a rest .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . You 're not too tired to talk to me though , are you ? ( Quite quietly . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( without conviction ) . No . ( Lies full length . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Well , I 'll sit down then . ( To side of Chesterfield . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Do . ( Sees she wants to sit down . He takes his legs off Chesterfield . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . So you really are better ? ( Sitting L. of Chesterfield . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Of course I 'm better — I feel splendid .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . And you still believe what the doctor said ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I always believe what every one says , I 'm a most trusting person .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Oh , is that how you made your money — by being trusting ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Certainly . I trusted other people to lose it and they did .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . How d'you mean — lose it ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Well , you see — look here , Sylvia , are you cross-examining me ?</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Nothing could be further from my thoughts , uncle dear , I only wondered , that 's all .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Well , do n't wonder any more — it 's most embarrassing — what have you been doing with yourself lately ?...</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . You know perfectly well , uncle , because you sat next to me in the car and I told you everything .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Well , tell me some more . Have you had any love affairs — girls always like to confide their love affairs .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Only when they have n't got any — but I do n't , anyhow . The only one of the family who has got it in the least badly is Bobbie ; he 's mad on Faith Crombie .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . So I gathered — why , do you suppose ?</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . We can n't think — she 's the most irritating girl I 've met for years — and her mother 's hateful , too .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Why are they here ?</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Oh , Bobbie wanted them asked , and mother 's much too sweet to deny us anything in reason .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I should n't call Mrs. Crombie in reason — she 's trying to pump me .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . You are rather a mysterious person you know , uncle , I should like to know lots more about you .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Everything about me is absolutely honourable and above board .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . I do n't know that it is .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . My dear Sylvia — you wound me , you grieve me — I feel deeply pained . I ——</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( laughing ) . It 's no use trying to bluster out of it , uncle , you know as well as I do that it was n't honourable of you to single me out for your money without letting the others know anything about it .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( quickly ) . You have n't told them , have you ? ( Puts his feet down . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . No — I do n't break my word .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . And I do n't break mine , so you need n't be so sniffy .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . It is breaking it in a way to show favouritism .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I only told you in the very strictest confidence because I had faith in you — trusted you ....</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . It was very sweet of you , uncle , but I do n't think you should have .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Well , after all , I ... it 's my money and surely I ——</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . You see , it 's so terribly unfair to the others — of course they do n't know , and I shall never breathe a word , but , uncle , I do wish you 'd leave everything to one of them and not me — I should n't feel happy for a moment with the money — not for a single moment if I 'd known all the time that I was going to get it . Rule me out of the list , there 's a dear — I 'm earning an awful lot now , you know , on the films and I really do n't need any more — promise you 'll do what I ask you ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I do n't think you 're quite in your right mind , but , still — ( smiling ) I 'll see .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . There , I knew you 'd see what I meant and be a lamb . Now tell me some of your adventures and things , and how you made the money .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( uncomfortably ) . Really , I do n't think that ....</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . It must be so glorious out there — mining and prospecting and — by the way how does one prospect ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . How does one prospect ? When one prospects one scoops up water from rivers and finds nuggets in one 's hands — if one 's lucky , of course .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . You do n't seem to know very much about it , uncle .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( nettled ) . On the contrary I know all about it — but you would n't understand if I went into technical details .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . I do n't believe you would , either .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( rises and goes L .) . I think , Sylvia , that this lack of trust in your fellow-creatures is a very sinister trait in your character — you must remember that I am a much older man than you are and ——</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . I 'm not a man at all .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( turns ) . Sometimes I wish you were , then I could tell you what I really think of you .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( rises and goes to him — laughing ) . There , uncle , I wo n't tease you any more , but still it must have been a wonderful moment when you discovered you had made a fortune out of your mine .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I did n't .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( relentlessly ) . But I thought ——</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . That is — not exactly — you see it was like this ....</stage>
   <stage>( Enter OLIVER from garden . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( under his breath ) . Thank God ! ( Sits chair below table . )</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER ( above arm-chair ) . Hallo Sylvia . Mother 's been looking for you — she wants you to help her pick strawberries for tea . Joyce is with her now , but she is n't much use because she eats them as fast as she picks them .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . I 'll go now . Stay and keep Uncle Dan company , Oliver . Get him to tell you some of his South American experiences . They 're awfully interesting . Bye-bye for the present , uncle .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Cheerio !</stage>
   <stage>( Exit SYLVIA , R .)</stage>
   <stage>I suppose you have n't such a thing as a whisky and soda about you , have you , Oliver ?</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . Of course , I 'll get you one .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I 'm feeling rather exhausted .</stage>
   <stage>( OLIVER goes to side table , mixes a drink and gives it to him . )</stage>
   <stage>( Weakly ) Thank you very much .</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER ( C ., fingering arm-chair ) . I say , uncle — can you — er — spare me a few minutes ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( apprehensively ) . Yes — what is it ?</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER ( awkwardly ) . Well , it 's like this — I know it 's rather bad form to talk about your will ——</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Yes , it is .</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . But I feel I must . I ——</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( hurriedly ) . Wait until another time , do n't you worry yourself about it now . You wait until I 'm dead .</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER ( firmly ) . No , I must get it over — I want to ask you to leave your money to one of the others and not to me at all . It was awfully decent of you to single me out and it bucked me up a lot to feel that you thought well of me , but now — well , I 'm earning steadily and I really do n't need a lot , in fact , it might do me harm to feel that I need n't work — also it would seem frightfully caddish to the others for me to have known all along that I was going to get it . Do n't you see what I 'm driving at ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . In a way , I do , yes ....</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . Well , you 'll do what I ask , wo n't you ? It 's a ripping feeling being independent ( EVANGELINE passes the window ) and earning money , and I want to go on at it — ( He glances out of the window ) . Here comes Vangy . Now leave it to her . Novel writing is a frightfully precarious show and she 's a woman and — anyhow , will you ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I 'll see .</stage>
   <stage>( Enter EVANGELINE . )</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . Ah , there you are , Uncle Daniel — I 've been looking for you — I want to have a little talk with you . ( Above Chesterfield . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . My God !</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . What did you say ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( feverishly ) . I said , My God !</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . Was n't that a little unnecessary — but still , I expect you get used to swearing over trifles out in the backwoods .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I was n't anywhere near the backwoods .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . Well , wherever you were then . Do go away , Oliver , I want to talk to Uncle Daniel privately .</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . Righto — you 'll remember what I said , wo n't you , Uncle ? Cheerio .</stage>
   <stage>( Exit OLIVER , R .)</stage>
   <stage>UNCLE . Cheerio . What ? Oh , yes , yes . ( after OLIVER has gone . )</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE ( goes to him ) . Now , look here — about that will of yours — I do n't feel that it 's quite fair to the others to ——</stage>
   <stage>( Enter MRS. CROMBIE from garden . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . Oh , there you are , Mr. Davis — I 've been wanting to have a little talk to you about South America . I had a brother out there , you know . ( Behind chair R. C . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( rising , jovially ) . Splendid — let 's talk about him for hours .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE ( a little annoyed ) . I 'll come back later , uncle . ( Moves to stairs . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . I hope I 'm not interrupting a heart-to-heart talk between uncle and niece .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Not at all , not at all — it 's a pleasure , I assure you .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE ( on stairs ) . It does n't matter a bit . Uncle Daniel is going to stay with us a long time , I hope .</stage>
   <stage>( Exit upstairs . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE ( settling herself in arm-chair ) . Splendid — have you such a thing as a cigarette ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . A cigarette , yes , certainly .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . And a match .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . And a match .</stage>
   <stage>( He hands her a case , she takes one , goes to mantel for matches — then he strikes a match and lights it . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE ( girlishly ) . Now we can be quite comfortable , can n't we ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Quite . ( Sits on Chesterfield . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . As I was saying just now , I had a brother out in South America .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . What part ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . I 'm not quite sure — we do n't hear from him much — he was sent out there for — for ——</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I quite understand .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . For his health .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I know , they all are . It 's a wonderful climate .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . He has n't written for ages and ages — we were wondering if he was making money or not — it seems so far away , anything may be happening to him .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . In all probability everything is —— SPACELEFT ( laughs to himself ) .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . Did you have any thrilling adventures when you were making your pile ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Oh yes , heaps and heaps .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . I gather that you have a mine of some sort ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Yes — just near the Grand Stand .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . The what ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . The Grand Slam .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . Slam !</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . It 's the name of a mountain , you know .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . What a strange name ! Why do they call it that ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I can n't imagine . It 's often been a source of great perplexity to me .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . I take it that yours is a gold mine .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Not so that you 'd notice it .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . I beg your pardon ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Well , I mean — it 's not especially a gold mine — it 's a mixed mine — a little bit of everything — there 's tin and silver and salt and copper and brass , and God knows what — it 's most exciting wondering what we are going to find next .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . Yes , so I should imagine ....</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Often on weary , dark nights — filled with the cries of the jackal and the boa-constrictor .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . I did n't know boa-constrictors cried .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Only when they are upset about something . Then they can n't help it . There are few animals as highly emotional as a boa-constrictor . Anyhow , as I was saying , we lay awake in the throbbing darkness — the darkness out there always throbs — it 's a most peculiar phenomenon — and wondered — Heavens , how we wondered what we should find on the following day .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . If you 'll forgive my saying so , Mr. Davis , I fear that you are a bit of a fraud .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I beg your pardon ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . I said I thought you were a fraud .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Of course I am — all great men are . Look at George Washington .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . He was n't a fraud .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . We only have his word for it . Besides he knew his father had seen him cut down the cherry tree . That 's why he confessed . Anyhow , why should you think I am ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . Because you obviously know nothing about mining , and I happen to know that there is no such thing as a mountain in South America called the Grand Slam . I was determined to find out as much as I could about you on account of my daughter .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( rises ) . My dear madam , I assure you that there is nothing whatever between your daughter and me — my intentions are absolutely honourable . ( Moves to fireplace . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE ( coldly ) . I was not alluding to you , but to your nephew — your youngest nephew .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Oh , I see .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . He has been making love to her . This afternoon he proposed to her ....</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Did he , by Jove !</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . He also spoke about a large sum of money that you intended to leave him — I 'm sure you will understand my position — I naturally want my daughter to marry well — and ——</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . And you mean to make quite sure of the money beforehand . I see .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . You put it rather crudely .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I think matters of this kind are better discussed crudely . One thing I will promise you , Mrs. Crombie . You shall know full particulars of my finances and everything else by the end of the day . Until then I fear that you must continue to regard me as a fraud .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . I hope you are not offended at my inquisitiveness , but I really ——</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . My dear Mrs. Crombie , when you have knocked about the world as much as I have — one learns never to be either surprised or shocked .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . It is very , very hard for mothers , nowadays .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Yes , is n't it ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . The children are all so modern they become quite ungovernable ....</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( coming forward slightly ) . I can only say then that my nephews and nieces are exceptions to the rule .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . I am so glad you are so satisfied with them .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I am ! I never realised until to-day how absolutely splendid it was to be an uncle . How wonderfully proud I should be of the fact that they are related to me . I came home eighteen months ago expecting to find a family of irritating self-centred young people idling about — true they were idling , but I liked them in spite of it — I have returned this time to find them not only hard-workers , but successful hard-workers . There is not one of them who has n't achieved something — even Joyce , the flapper , has set to and made good at school . I tell you I 'm proud of them , so proud that I could shout it from the house tops , and may I say this , Mrs. Crombie , that if your daughter has succeeded in making Bobbie fall in love with her , she is a very fortunate young woman .</stage>
   <stage>( MRS. CROMBIE shows boredom during speech . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . Oh , is she ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Because he is a fine boy , so is Oliver , so are they all splendid — and she should be proud to know them .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . It really is very lucky that you are so contented with your lot . Personally , I 'm not so ecstatic . Admitting for a moment that your nephew has such a marvellously fine character — which I doubt — he should not have made love to my daughter without being certain of his prospects .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I will speak to him , Mrs. Crombie .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . I should be very grateful if you would . ( Rises and moves up to him . ) And please understand that nothing — nothing is to be settled without my consent .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I quite understand that .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROMBIE . Thank you so much — I think I 'll rejoin the others in the garden now .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I 'm sure they 'd be charmed .</stage>
   <stage>( Exit MRS. CROMBIE into garden . DANIEL , left alone , lights another cigarette . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( feelingly ) . Whew ! What a woman ! ( Falls on Chesterfield . )</stage>
   <stage>( EVANGELINE peeps downstairs . )</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . Has she gone ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Yes , thank Heaven . I say , Vangy , she is a very objectionable woman .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE ( coming down ) . I know — we all loathe her . Now at last I can talk to you alone . ( Sits beside him . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Look here , Evangeline , I know exactly what you are going to say , and I settle it all on Griggs , if you like . He 'll take it , he 's a Scotsman .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . How did you know ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Instinct , my dear , pure instinct .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE ( rises ) . Let 's talk it all over .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( rises and goes L .) . No , not now , I must go up to my room .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . Oh , just a little talk !</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I have some letters to write . Also I 'm tired and I feel my illness coming on again . Also I must wash before tea . Also ——</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE ( laughing ) . It 's quite obvious that you do n't want to , so I 'll leave you alone . Cheerio for the present .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . They all say that . Cheerio ! I 'm sure it portends something ....</stage>
   <stage>( He goes off upstairs . )</stage>
   <stage>( Enter JOYCE from garden dragging FAITH after her . )</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . Now you 've just got to tell the others that .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH ( flustered ) . But I promised Bobbie I would n't say a word ....</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . Well , you 've broken your word once , so you can do it again . Vangy ! Vangy ! ( She goes to window , still dragging FAITH . ) Sylvia ! Oliver ! Bobbie !</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . What on earth is the matter ?</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . Faith will tell you when the others come . ( Dragging FAITH back to C .)</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Look here , this is n't a bit fair of you . Bobbie will never forgive me ....</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . I can n't help Bobbie 's troubles — you should have thought of that before .</stage>
   <stage>( Enter SYLVIA and OLIVER from garden . )</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . What 's up ?</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . The moment Bobbie comes , you shall know — yell for him , Oliver ....</stage>
   <stage>( FAITH attempts to escape , SYLVIA stops her . )</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER ( goes to window and yells ) . Bobb-ie ! Hurry up , we want you .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( off ) . All right — coming ....</stage>
   <stage>( They wait in silence — JOYCE still holds firmly on to FAITH 'S arm . Enter BOBBIE from garden — rather breathless . The positions are as follows :— EVANGELINE down R. SYLVIA R. C . above Chesterfield . BOBBIE a little above SYLVIA slightly on her L. FAITH C. JOYCE on FAITH 'S L. OLIVER up L .)</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . What 's the bother ?</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . Now , Faith , tell them .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . I wo n't .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . Very well , I will — it 's most important — listen , all of you — Bobbie was flirting with Faith this afternoon , and he told her that Uncle had singled him out from us all to leave his money to ....</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Oh , Faith , how could you . ( FAITH crosses to window L .)</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( judiciously ) . Is this true , Bobbie ?</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( miserably ) . Yes , but I could n't help it ....</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Of course you could n't . Do n't be silly — now I 'll tell you something . Uncle said exactly the same thing to me .</stage>
   <stage>EVERY ONE . What !</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . So he did to me , the dirty dog .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . Yes , I guessed as much when Faith told me — he promised his whole fortune to me if I won prizes and things at school .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . Well , I need n't tell you that he said the same to me .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . What 's his game ?</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Had n't we better ask him ?</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . Yes , where is he ?</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . Upstairs writing letters , washing and being ill .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Run up and fetch him , Bobbie .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . All right .</stage>
   <stage>( Exit upstairs two at a time . )</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . I 'd love to know what he 's up to .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . You will in a minute .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . I should n't be too sure , if he 's deceived us once , he 'll probably try to do it again . I do n't feel that I can trust him at all now .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . Look here , when he comes down , what are we to say to him — Oliver 'd better do it all , he 's the eldest .</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER ( comes down to table ) . I 'm hanged if I will .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . All right , dear , do n't get crusty before the time ; I expect you 'll have full opportunities for that later . I 'll be spokesman .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . All right .</stage>
   <stage>( Re-enter DANIEL , followed by BOBBIE , wiping his hands on a towel . BOBBIE goes R .)</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( C .) . I feel a little like Lady Macbeth , but Bobbie would n't let me dry properly . What on earth 's the matter ?</stage>
   <stage>{ We want to know . EVERY ONE . { Look here , Uncle Daniel .... { We want an explanation , Uncle Daniel .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . You all appear to be perturbed about something .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . We are .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Shut up , Bobbie , I 'm spokesman .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( weakly ) . Could n't it be some one else ? Sylvia 's so firm with me .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . I think , uncle , that you occasionally need firmness . ( Coming down R. by Chesterfield . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . We all do , it 's a weakness of the human race — lack of stamina — I have it at the moment . Please may I sit down ?</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . Yes .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( sinking into arm-chair ) . Thank you so much . ( Weakly . ) I begin to feel sleepy . May I have perhaps — a small glass of water ?</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . All right — I 'll get it . ( He goes to sideboard . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . With perhaps the teeniest , weeniest little drop of whisky ?</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . This is all useless prevarication , you know — we have some very important questions to ask you .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( rising ) . Perhaps I 'd better stand up then , it 's more imposing . ( He takes water from Bobbie . ) Thank you a thousand times . Cheerio ! !</stage>
   <stage>( They all make a movement of annoyance . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Now then , uncle , we 've discovered that you have been deceiving us ....</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( amazed ) . I — deceive you ? I 'm pained ! I 'm hurt ! You 've wounded me to the quick .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . I do n't believe you 've got a quick .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Shut up , Bobbie !</stage>
   <stage>( FAITH is by window L .)</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Yes , through the agency of Miss Crombie here .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Ah , Miss Crombie , I 've just been chatting to your mother . ( Goes to table and puts glass on it . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( ignoring his interruption . ) Your dastardly trick has been exposed , is it or is it not true that you took each of us aside in turn a year and a half ago and filled us up with confidential lies about your will ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( bravely ) . It 's absolutely true .</stage>
   <stage>( Move from all . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Why did you do it ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( laughing with forced roguishness ) . Ah !...</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( firmly — with emphasis on each word ) . Why did you do it ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Do you really want to know ?</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE ( below form ) . Of course we do .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Very well , then I 'll tell you . The reason was this . You were a set of idle young bounders . ( A move from all . ) You 'd never done a stroke of work in your lives — neither have I , but I did n't see why you should n't . There was your poor mother left comparatively hard up — you would have to have left this house which would have made her perfectly miserable , so I determined to spur you on to do something ( breaking into a smile . ) I say , you must admit I 've succeeded !</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Never mind , that — go on .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( still smiling ) . Well , not having a penny in the world with which to help you myself ——</stage>
   <stage>EVERYONE . What !!!! !</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I repeat — not having a penny ——</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER ( below table ) . Do you mean to say you have n't any money at all ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( cheerfully ) . Not a bob ! Except on the all too rare occasions when I win a bit . ( Laughing . ) If it were not for the darling little horses , I should n't be able to get across to England at all .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . What about the mine you told us of ?</stage>
   <stage>( JOYCE is R. of table . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I never told you of a mine .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . Oh , uncle , you are a fibber !</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . You said I had a mine . As a matter of fact I am part owner in one . Unfortunately it was long ago proved to be absolutely worthless . But please do n't worry yourselves over me . I shall be all right .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( R. C . ) . We were n't .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( C ) . I did n't say you were , I said do n't . I also told you , now that I come to think of it , that I had only three years to live . That was put in as a bit of local colour . I hope to live to eighty-two or even eighty-three .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( above Chesterfield ) . Well , all I can say is — it 's the rottenest trick I ever heard .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . Uncle , how could you ? ( She sniffs . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . How dare you come here and stuff us up with promises that you can never keep . I 'm jolly well fed up . I thought you were such a sport and — oh , what 's the use of talking . You do n't give a damn . Come away , Faith .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH ( tossing her head ) . Very well .</stage>
   <stage>( Exit BOBBIE and FAITH into garden . )</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE ( coming forward , moves between Chesterfield and arm-chair — contemptuously ) . It strikes me as being a singularly pointless practical joke — I 'm very disappointed in you , Uncle Daniel .</stage>
   <stage>( Exit R .)</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER ( coming in front of JOYCE ) . So am I — damned disappointed . I thought you were too decent to do a thing like that .</stage>
   <stage>( Exit R .)</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . I think you 're horrid , it 'll get all over the school now . ( She bursts into tears and exits R .)</stage>
   <stage>( SYLVIA turns and looks at UNCLE DANIEL . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . They 've all had a go at me . Have n't you anything to say too , Sylvia ?</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . No , I have n't anything to say at all .</stage>
   <stage>UNCLE DANIEL . Oh ! ( Sits in armchair . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . You see I knew all the time . ( Goes to above him . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( incredulously ) . You knew ?</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Well , I guessed from the first and found out afterwards .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . But how ?</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Well , uncle darling , I knew that no one with a smile like yours could ever have a bob !</stage>
   <stage>( Kisses him , goes off laughing . UNCLE DANIEL settles himself in armchair , smiling . )</stage>
   <p>CURTAIN .</p>
   <p>ACT III .</p>
   <stage>SCENE .— The scene is the same as the preceding acts . Alterations in the furniture are noted at the end of the play . It is seven-thirty on the morning following the events of ACT II . When the CURTAIN rises , the sun is streaming in through the open window L. C . BOBBIE can be seen standing just outside looking up apparently at an upper window .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( calling softly ) . Faith ! Faith !</stage>
   <stage>FAITH ( heard off ) . What is it ?</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Come down and talk to me .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Do n't be silly —</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Please do — I 've got lots to tell you .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Oh , all right — wait a minute .</stage>
   <stage>( BOBBIE comes mooching into the hall through the window . Enter FAITH downstairs . )</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Good morning , Mr. Dermott . ( Offers hand coldly . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( L. C . ) . I say — you have been quick .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH ( C ., coldly ) . I 've been up for hours — what is it you want ?</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . I 've had a perfectly miserable night — I could n't sleep a wink . I want to know if you really meant what you said last night .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Of course I really meant it , how silly you are .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . I 'm not silly — I thought maybe it was only the heat of the moment that made you so utterly beastly .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . If you 're going to be rude I shall go away . ( She sits down in chair by Chesterfield . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Do you really care for me so little that you can give me up at a moment 's notice like that ?</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . You will not understand Bobbie — I had to .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Why ?</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Because mother made me promise .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( up to her ) . What did she make you promise ?</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . She made me promise that — that ——</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Well ?</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Well , you see I 'm an only child , and mother wants me to be happy above all things and ——</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . I could make you happy — wonderfully happy .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Mother does n't think so . You see I 've always been used to having money and comforts and things .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Do you imagine that I should n't have been able to give you all the comforts you wanted whether I had uncle 's money or not ? Why , in a year or so I shall be making hundreds and hundreds . I mean to be successful — nothing will stop me .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . Well , Bobbie , if you come to me again then , perhaps mother would ——</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . You mean that I 'm to go on working for my happiness on the off chance of your being free to accept me ? Neither you nor your mother have enough trust in me to believe that I shall make a big name for myself . Good God , it was a pretty thought of your parents to call you “ Faith . ” I suppose if you had a couple of sisters you 'd call them Hope and Charity .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . It 's no use being angry and beastly about it . One must use a little common sense .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . It is n't a question of common sense , but common decency .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . How dare you say that . ( She pulls him round by the leg of his trousers . He brushes her hand away . She repeats this business . ) Why can n't we just be friends ?</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . You know I 'm much too fond of you to be just friends . Men can n't switch their feelings on and off like bath-taps . If they mean a thing they mean it , and there 's an end of it .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . I wish I 'd never come down at all if all you mean to do is grumble at me .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . It 's more than grumbling — it 's genuine unhappiness . ( Sits on form below table . ) I quite realize now that you never really cared for me a bit , in spite of what you said ; but still I want to find out why — why you 've changed so suddenly , why need you have hurt me so much . If you 'd written breaking it off , it would have been different , but you 've been so — so unnecessarily brutal .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . It was mother 's fault .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Is everything you do your mother 's affair ? Does she count every breath you take ? Why , your life simply can n't be worth living !</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . I wish I could make you see ....</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( in a lower register ) . I 'm afraid you 've made me see too much . I did n't know people could be so callous and cruel ....</stage>
   <stage>FAITH ( quickly ) . I 'm not callous and cruel .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Oh yes , you are , and you 've made me determine one thing , and that is that henceforth I honestly mean to cut women out of my life for ever . ( A move from FAITH . ) I know it 's a hackneyed thing to say , but I mean it . I ought to have taken a lesson from other fellows ’ experiences , but of course I did n't .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH . I think you 're very silly and childish to be so bitter .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Bitter ! ( Laughs satirically . ) What else could I be ? The one girl whom I cared for and trusted has gaily thrown me over the first moment she hears that I am not going to have as much money as she thought . I 'm losing my temper now , and I 'm glad of it . I shall probably repent every word I say afterwards , but that wo n't stop me telling you exactly what I think of you . I do n't suppose you 've ever been in love at all — except to the extent of having signed photographs of Owen Nares and Henry Ainley stuck all over your bedroom , but when you do , I hope you get it really badly , you deserve to be absolutely utterly wretched , as wretched as you 've made me , and I hope when you do marry that you get a rotten old Scotch marmalade maker who says “ Hoots ! ” and spills haggis all down his waistcoat .</stage>
   <stage>FAITH ( bursting into tears ) . Oh , Bobbie , how dare you ....</stage>
   <stage>( goes to her and goes down on his knees )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Oh , Faith darling , forgive me , I did n't mean a word of it — I swear I did n't ....</stage>
   <stage>FAITH ( they both rise ) . Whether you meant it or not I hate you . ( Pushes him away . ) You 're blatant and beastly , and I never wish to see you again . ( She walks upstairs and pauses . ) I shall have breakfast in my room . ( Exit . )</stage>
   <stage>( BOBBIE stamps out and collides with SYLVIA , who is coming in with a bunch of freshly picked flowers . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Why can n't you look where you 're going ?</stage>
   <stage>( He stamps out of sight . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Nice sweet-tempered little fellow . ( Moves to above table ; puts roses in bowl . Takes “ Daily Mirror ” from window-seat , goes down to Chesterfield and reads it . )</stage>
   <stage>( Enter DANIEL downstairs with bag . He comes very quietly and does n't see SYLVIA . He stumbles and SYLVIA watches him . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( suddenly ) . Excuse me ! Have you been stealing any thing .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( putting down bag ) . Damn ! I did n't want any one to see me .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Where were you going ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( coming R. C . ) . To the Green Hart . I could n't face another meal like dinner last night .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . I know it was pretty awful , but you can n't go out of the house like this . Mother 'd be furious .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . One more would n't matter — everybody else is . ( Coming L. C . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . I 'm not a bit .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I know , I was just going to except you ; you 've been charming , but really it was terrible . I can n't stay . Oliver has such a lowering expression , and if Joyce gives me one more “ dumb animal in pain ” look , I shall scream .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . I can n't understand why they 're all being so silly — I gave them credit for more sense of humour .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . And Bobbie — Bobbie was the worst of the lot .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Well , one can forgive him a little more because of Faith .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Why ? What about Faith ?</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( rising , going to him ) . Oh , the little beast chucked him last night , the moment she heard you were n't going to leave him a fortune .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Did she , by Jove !</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( returning R. C . ) . Personally I 'm delighted . I always distrusted her , and this proves what I 've said all along . But that does n't make Bobbie any better tempered about it .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( L. C . ) . Poor old Bobbie , I bet he hates me .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . If he does he 's a fool .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . After all you can n't blame him , it 's only natural .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . He ought to be jolly grateful to you for being the means of showing her up .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Perhaps — but he wo n't be . I know what it feels like ; we all go through it sometime or another . I 'd love to wring that girl 's neck though .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . You like Bobbie best of us all , do n't you ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . With the exception of you — yes . I think it 's because he 's the most like me . He is , you know . If he 'd lived my life he 'd have done exactly the same things .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . I wonder . ( Sits L. of Chesterfield . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( smiling ) . I know . ( He sits on chair , head of table . ) He 's got just the same regard for the truth , the same sublime contempt of the world , and the same amount of bombast and good opinion of himself that I started with , I only hope he 'll make better use of his chances , and carve out a better career for himself .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . If he does , he 'll owe it all to you — first for rousing him up and making him work , and secondly for getting rid of Faith for him . Had he married her , she 'd have been a millstone round his neck . He does n't realize it now , but yesterday was one of the luckiest days of his life .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . D'you really think so ?</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . I 'm sure of it .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . That 's simply splendid . You 've bucked me up tremendously . I sha n't mind the Green Hart nearly so much now . ( Rising . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( putting him back on seat ) . Uncle , you 're not to go to the Green Hart at all , I wo n't have it .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I must . When they all sit round looking reproachfully at me , it makes me feel as if I could sink under the table .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( patting him and kneeling by him ) . But they wo n't — they 'll have got over it .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . They 're all much too young to get over being made fools of as quickly as that .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . But , uncle ——</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . It 's no use — I 'm firm . I wo n't come back until they want me . As a matter of fact I realise I 've been very foolish . I should n't have let things go so far . Naturally they were terribly disappointed at my wanting to live till eighty-two or eighty-three , and not having any money to leave them .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . They 're not really disappointed so much as outraged . They feel you 've been laughing up your sleeve at them , as of course you have .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . No , I have n't — you 're wrong there — I have n't . I could n't help you financially . I 'd borrowed the money to come over and the cheque I 'd sent before . I 'd just won , so I thought that the only way to assist at all was to use mental persuasion on all of you . There 's always something fascinating in the idea of having money left one . It seems such an easy way of getting it . Of course it answered better than I could have imagined in my wildest dreams .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . It was a little unnecessary to take each of us aside like you did and stuff us up with hope .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . That and a bunch of keys was all I had . It was such a wonderful situation . I — never having had a penny in the wide , ( gaily ) , arranging to leave you my entire fortune . ( He starts to laugh . ) You must confess it was very , very funny .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( also laughing ) . Yes , it was .... ( They both laugh heartily ) .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( still laughing ) . And when I said I had sleeping sickness !...</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( weak with laughter ) . Oh , uncle , how could you .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( wiping his eyes ) . Oh dear , oh dear !</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Poor mother getting more mystified every minute , and bothered poor Tibbets till he does n't know if he is on his head or his heels .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( rising suddenly ) . But look here , they 'll all be down in a minute . ( SYLVIA stands up . ) They must n't find me here , poised for flight . I must go at once . ( Going behind Chesterfield and picking up bag . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( L. of him ) . Yes , but will you promise on your word of honour to come back the moment I send for you ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . If you give me your word of honour not to send for me until everything 's quite all right and everyone is perfectly amiable towards me . I could n't bear any more rebuffs . I should burst into tears if anybody even gave me a look !</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Yes , I 'll promise .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I trust you because , after all , you spotted from the first .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . That was n't very difficult . I 've always had a good eye for hypocrites . ( DANIEL slaps her . ) Mind you do n't go any further afield than the Green Hart !</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . You bet I sha n't !</stage>
   <stage>( Exit DANIEL through window . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( looking out of window after him ) . Bye-bye ! ( Coming down stage . ) Bless his heart !</stage>
   <stage>( Enter GRIGGS from R. with breakfast dishes which he places on sideboard . )</stage>
   <stage>GRIGGS . Will you do the coffee as usual , miss ?</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Yes , Griggs . By the way , get me a bigger bowl for those roses when you have time .</stage>
   <stage>GRIGGS . Yes , miss .</stage>
   <stage>( He bangs loudly on a big gong , and exits R. Enter MRS. DERMOTT downstairs . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Hello , mother . ( Kiss across L . banisters . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Good morning , darling . Are there any letters ?</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Only one for you , I think .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT ( taking letter from table ) . From Tibbets , I expect . ( Sniffs at it . ) No ! From Isobel Harris . ( Sits at the head of the table . ) I do hope she does n't want to come and stay — I could n't bear that . ( Opens it . ) Oh no , it 's only to say that Fanny 's engaged to an officer in the Coldstream Guards . How splendid for her .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Poor Fanny — I 'm glad . ( Sits in chair on her mother 's left . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Why do you say poor Fanny , dear ? I 'm sure she 's very fortunate . Now-a-days when nice men are so scarce . I was only saying ——</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . She did n't say he was a nice man — only that he was in the Coldstream Guards . I said poor because I can just imagine all her awful relations as bridesmaids , and her father and mother shoving her up the altar steps in their efforts to get her safely married .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Isobel means well , although she 's a little trying . But I 've never liked Charlie — no man with such a long , droopy moustache could ever be really trusted . Besides , they 're so insanitary . Sound the gong again , dear . I do wish they 'd all learn to be a little more punctual .</stage>
   <stage>( SYLVIA does so , and returns to sideboard . Enter JOYCE downstairs followed by OLIVER ; they are both obviously suffering from temper . They both kiss mother . )</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE ( disagreeably , as she comes downstairs ) . All right ! All right !— we 're coming . What 's the fuss ? ( Sits on form . )</stage>
   <stage>( OLIVER crosses to Chesterfield , picks up SYLVIA 'S paper and reads , pacing up and down . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . There 's no fuss , darling , but it 's stupid to let the breakfast get cold . I 've got mushrooms this morning , specially because Uncle Daniel likes them .</stage>
   <stage>( Enter BOBBIE from garden profoundly gloomy . Kisses mother . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . You could hear that beastly gong a mile off .</stage>
   <stage>( SYLVIA crosses to table with coffee and milk . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . I 'm so glad , dear . It shows it 's a good gong . Ring the bell , will you , Oliver ? ( OLIVER does so . ) Where 's Evangeline ? She 's generally quite an early bird .</stage>
   <stage>( Enter EVANGELINE downstairs . She is distinctly depressed . )</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE ( on the stairs ) . Here I am , mother ( kisses MRS. DERMOTT ) . ( With sarcasm . ) What a pity it is that the bath water is n't a little hotter . I hate tepidity in anything . ( Sits on SYLVIA 'S left . )</stage>
   <stage>( BOBBIE serves bacon , sitting at the foot of the table , facing MRS . DERMOTT . )</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . If Joyce did n't bounce in and take it all it would be hotter .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . I did n't have a bath at all this morning , so there .</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . Well , you 're a dirty little pig then .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . There 's probably something wrong with the boiler . I 'll see about it after breakfast .</stage>
   <stage>( Enter GRIGGS , comes below MRS . DERMOTT . )</stage>
   <stage>Oh , Griggs , just tap on Miss Crombie 's door , will you , and tell her that breakfast is ready .</stage>
   <stage>GRIGGS . Miss Crombie wished me to say that she is taking breakfast in her bedroom , madam . I 'm sending up a tray .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Quite right , Griggs . I wonder if she 's feeling ill or anything . I 'll go up presently . Oh , and will you find out if Mr. Davis is coming down soon ?</stage>
   <stage>GRIGGS . Mr. Davis is not in his room , madam .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Not ? How very strange — he 's probably in the garden somewhere . That 'll do , Griggs ?</stage>
   <stage>( Exit GRIGGS , R .)</stage>
   <stage>Perhaps you 'd better sound the gong again , Bobbie , he might not have heard it .</stage>
   <stage>( BOBBIE crossing in front of table goes to the gong and bangs savagely on it . Every one stops up their ears . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . You seem to have taken a dislike to that gong , darling . We must start without him , that 's all . Do sit down , Oliver , you 're much too big to pace backwards and forwards like that . Pour out the coffee , Sylvia dear , if it 's ready .</stage>
   <stage>( OLIVER sits on EVANGELINE 'S left . BOBBIE sits again at the foot of the table . JOYCE drops her fork with a loud clatter — every one jumps . SYLVIA pours out coffee . )</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . If you 'd endeavour to cultivate a little more repose , Joyce dear , it would be an advantage .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE ( truculently ) . I could n't help it .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT ( brightly ) . Fancy — Fanny Harris is engaged .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( gloomily ) . What fun .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . It may not be fun to you , but it will be most amusing to Mrs. Harris . I do wish Daniel would come in . Where can he be ?</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . No one cares , anyhow .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . How can you be so horrid , Bobbie — I did think you 'd have recovered from your silly temper before this . Fancy not being able to take a joke .</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . It was n't a joke , it was true .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . You really are utterly absurd . Pass me the toast . I would n't have believed you could all have been so silly . I expect Uncle Daniel is just laughing at you .</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . Yes , that 's just what he is doing .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . I really think , Oliver , that you , as the eldest , ought to set a little better example . And the marmalade — thank you . After all , considering how good he 's been to us , we might allow him to have a little joke without becoming disagreeable — even if it does n't amuse us very much . Why , I ——</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . But , mother , I tell you it is n't a joke — it 's the gospel truth .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . I 've never known such a set of maddening children . Pass me the paper , will you , Sylvia ? I wish to read it .</stage>
   <stage>( SYLVIA hands her newspaper from window seat and she opens it out and reads it , ignoring the family altogether . Telegraph — with extra pages inserted . )</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER ( breaking the silence ) . Has any one seen my tennis racquet ?</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . Bobbie had it yesterday .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . No , I did n't .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . Yes , you did , you and Faith — I saw you .</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . Well , where is it now ?</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( ruminatively ) . I did see a racquet behind the summer house this morning . Would that be it ?</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER ( furiously ) . Look here , Bobbie , if you go leaving my racquet out all night again I 'll punch your head ....</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( rising , flaring up ) . I tell you I never touched your damned racquet — I 've got one of my own . ( Knocks his chair over . )</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . A jolly rotten one , though .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Shut up , Joyce , and mind your own business .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . Do n't speak to Joyce like that , Bobbie . You ought to be ashamed of yourself .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . I 'll speak how I like .</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER ( rising ) . Not while I 'm here , you wo n't .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( jeeringly ) . Come on , oh strong and silent elder brother , let 's be manly and knock one another about .</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . A little more of that would do you a lot of good .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Well , you 'd better not try it .</stage>
   <stage>( OLIVER knocks a plate on to the floor , breaking it . )</stage>
   <stage>There , that 's what happens when you let elephants loose in the house . ( Picks up his chair . )</stage>
   <stage>( During this , MRS. DERMOTT does comic business with newspaper , repeatedly dropping sheets and attempting to fold the paper . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Oliver , if you and Bobbie can n't stop quarrelling you 'd better both leave the table . I can n't think what 's the matter with you all . Just because Uncle Daniel chose to have a little fun with you , you all behave like bears with sore heads .</stage>
   <stage>( BOBBIE and OLIVER re-sit and continue eating . )</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . Uncle Daniel meant every word he said , mother . He has n't got a penny in the world .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Nonsense , Evangeline . How do you suppose he could get backwards and forwards to America and send me large cheques and things ?</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . He wins a little from time to time by horse-racing .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Rubbish . No one can ever win at horse-racing . I never did . The bookies and jockeys and people do n't let you .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . Mother dear , how can you be so obstinate . I tell you he told us all about it in here yesterday afternoon — gave us his solemn word ——</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . But only in fun , darling , only in fun — he 's obviously a very rich man .</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . Hah !</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . By the by , I wish one of you would just go into the garden and find him . The mushrooms will be ruined .</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . He is n't in the garden at all , mother , he 's gone to the Green Hart .</stage>
   <stage>( All look surprised . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . What do you mean , Sylvia ? Why has he gone to the Green Hart ?</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Because every one here had been so beastly to him .</stage>
   <stage>( They all continue breakfast hurriedly . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . You mean that he ——! Oh , Sylvia ! ( She bursts into tears . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Mother darling , do n't cry .... ( Rises and kisses her . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT ( weeping bitterly ) . Darling Danny . My only brother . And you 've driven him away — after all his kindness and everything . Oh , how could you ? How could you ? He must be sent for at once . ( She rises and rings the bell , dropping bits of newspaper en route . ) You 're wicked , wicked children , and you do n't deserve any one to be kind to you ever again .</stage>
   <stage>( Enter GRIGGS , R .)</stage>
   <stage>Oh , Griggs , send the car down to the Green Hart at once to fetch Mr. Davis .</stage>
   <stage>GRIGGS . Yes , madam .</stage>
   <stage>( Exit GRIGGS , R .)</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT ( C .) . How dare you behave like you have done . I shall never , never forgive you — you 're cruel and horrid and ——</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . It 's all very fine , mother , but he made fools of us .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . He did n't do anything of the sort — he only meant it kindly — going to all that trouble , too ( she weeps again ) , with one foot in the grave .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . And the other in the Green Hart .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . He 's not going to die . He said he meant to live to eighty-two .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Eighty-three , I think , was the age , dear , but that 's just another instance of his dear unselfishness — so that you would n't worry over him . I know ! I 'm going up to my room — you 've upset me for the rest of the day . Call me the very moment he comes . Oh , how could you ? How could you be so unkind ? Oh , just look at my nose , it 's all red and shiny .</stage>
   <stage>( Exit upstairs . SYLVIA follows , standing at the foot of the stairs , looking after her . There is silence for a moment . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . That 's torn it .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . Now what are we to do ?</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( moving down ) . I know . ( At head of table . )</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . What , then ?</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Apologise to Uncle Dan , every one of you , for being such utter beasts .</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . Well , I 'm hanged !</stage>
   <stage>( During the following speech , the others continue their breakfasts . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . So you jolly well ought to be . Who do you owe your position in the motor works to , Oliver ? Uncle Dan . Who do you owe your song successes to , Bobbie ? Uncle Dan . And you , Joyce , d'you think you 'd have won a single thing if it had n't been for him ? Do you imagine Evangeline would have had the vim to have stuck to her novel if it had n't been for Uncle Dan 's faith in her ? I know I should never have done a thing , either . And all we did it for apparently , was that he could die off conveniently and leave us his money — the moment he 'd done that I suppose we should have stopped working . What charming characters ! Waiting for a man to die , and then getting disagreeable because he says he does n't want to . Do you think any one of you would stop work now for anything ? Of course you would n't . I know that . Do n't you see that Uncle Dan chose the one and only way of really helping us ? He 's worked wonders and we ought to be thankful to him until our dying day ....</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( marmalade on toast in hand ) . It 's all very fine for you — he has n't come between you and the only person you 've ever loved ....</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . And that 's one of the best things of all — he 's been the means of showing Faith up in her true colours . Bobbie , you must realise now in your heart of hearts what a rotter she is ?</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . She would n't have been if it was n't for her beastly mother . Just because you found him out before us , by a fluke , you think you can preach to us about being rude to him . Well , you 'd have been just as bad under the same circumstances , if not worse . The fact of you having spotted his game does n't make it any the less disgusting . He 's behaved atrociously and you know it , making fools of us all . What do you think my friends will say ? Joyce 's school girls ? Vangy 's literary nuts ?</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( coming down R. to below Chesterfield ) . It 's your own silly faults . You should n't have told them .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE ( rising ) . Do n't be so superior . Of course we only did in confidence . ( Going up R ., followed by JOYCE . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Well , that 's not Uncle Dan 's fault , he only did it for the best ....</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE . Best be damned !</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . If you can n't curb your language I should think you 'd better go outside .</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( rising , knife in hand ) . I shall do exactly as I like . I 'm fed up with you , Sylvia , you 're as bad as he is . ( Throws knife on table . ) And if you think you can get round us by making excuses for him you 're jolly well mistaken . I suppose all this is a put-up job ! ( Moves to L. C . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( R. C . ) . How dare you , Bobbie ! It 's nothing of the sort . Only luckily I have a little discrimination , I can see the difference between good and bad , and Uncle Dan 's good , good all through . He would n't do harm to any one or anything in the world . He did all this out of genuine kindness . He could n't help us in any other way , so he made us work , hoping it would improve us . And I should think he 'd go back to America sick and wretched inside with disappointment having discovered that we , his only relatives , have only liked him and been nice to him because of his money — waiting for him to die like beastly treacherous ghouls .</stage>
   <stage>( EVANGELINE attempts to speak . )</stage>
   <stage>That 's what you are , ghouls ! ( Turning on EVANGELINE . ) And selfish pigs , and if you do n't apologise to him I shall never speak to any of you again .</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . Hah ! ( Throws down serviette and exits R .)</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Oh , you 're very dignified walking out like that without saying anything . I hate you ! I hate you all ! Poor Uncle Daniel — it 's rotten . ( She bursts out crying , and subsides on Chesterfield . )</stage>
   <stage>( Towards the end of her speech , the rest have risen and walked out with their heads in the air , R. BOBBIE kicks violently at paper on floor and goes upstairs . There is a moment 's pause , then enter DANIEL from garden . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( coming C .) . I left the car down the drive , hoping to make a sweet lovable entrance with perhaps a few rose leaves on my coat . Where is everybody ?</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( sniffing on Chesterfield ) . It 's no use , they 're still being beastly . Mother sent for you . She 's frightfully upset at your going to the Green Hart .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . If they 're keeping it up , I think I 'd better go back . ( Moving towards entrance . )</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( rising ) . No , you 're not to do anything of the sort , you 're to stay here . ( Firmly . ) They can be as disagreeable as they like , we 'll go about together ; you can come to the studio with me to-morrow morning .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( up to her ) . You , Sylvia , are what is described as a sympathetic character . You 've been very nice to me all along . Can I leave you anything ?</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . Do n't joke about it , uncle , it 's all so horrid .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . If I do n't joke I shall burst into storms of passionate sobbing . ( Moves down C .)</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA . That would be rather awful . Here comes mother ....</stage>
   <stage>( Enter MRS. DERMOTT downstairs . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Danny darling , why were you so silly as to take any notice of the children ? They 're unkind and heartless , and I ordered the mushrooms specially for you this morning . Sit down and have them now . They 'll be quite hot still . ( She pushes him into chair . ) Sylvia , get them , if you please . I can n't think why they 're all behaving like this , I shall never forgive them , Danny dear . You wo n't let them upset you , will you ?</stage>
   <stage>( She kisses him . MRS. DERMOTT sits in SYLVIA 'S chair , DANIEL in MRS . DERMOTT 'S . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Well , they seem to have upset everything else .</stage>
   <stage>( Enter GRIGGS , R .)</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Bring some more toast and coffee , Griggs . Or would you rather have tea ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Tea , please .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Tea then , Griggs .</stage>
   <stage>GRIGGS . Very good , madam . ( Picks up remains of paper above Chesterfield and exit R .)</stage>
   <stage>SYLVIA ( handing him plate of mushrooms and bacon ) . Here you are , uncle dear — I 'm going upstairs . Call me if you want anything .</stage>
   <stage>( Exit SYLVIA upstairs . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . I will .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . I 'm sure he wo n't .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Now look here , Anne , you 're not to include Sylvia in your fury against the family . She has been perfectly sweet .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . So she ought to be — and the others as well . Such nonsense , I never heard of such a thing . Not being able to take a joke better than that . I do n't know what 's happened to them , they were such dear good-natured children . They used to make booby traps and apple-pie beds for one another and not mind a bit .</stage>
   <stage>( MRS. DERMOTT keeps buttering toast for him , arranging it round his plate . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . But you see , Anne , this perhaps has irritated them more than an apple-pie bed .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . I do n't see why , it 's just as harmless , and much less trouble .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . If I had known they were going to take it so badly I should have thought of something else . I have lots of ideas . But even now , when I come to look back over everything , I do n't see what else I could have done .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . You 're just the kindest old darling in the world and everything , every single thing you have done for us , has been perfect .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Dear Anne , do n't be absurd . It was nothing , worse than nothing , but I 'd given it a lot of thought , and after all it has bucked them up and made them work . They 're looking much better in health , too .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Oh , Danny , I only wish you were better in health . The shadow of your illness just hangs over me like a nightmare . I can n't pass a flower shop without thinking of you .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( puts down knife and fork ) . But I 'm not ill at all . I 've no intention of dying until I 'm eighty-three or even eighty-four .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Dear old boy , you 're only saying that so that I sha n't worry . ( She dabs her eyes . ) But it 's no use , you can n't deceive me , you know .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . But , Anne , I swear .—</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . There , there , we 'll say no more about it . It only upsets me and here 's your tea .</stage>
   <stage>( She takes tea from GRIGGS , who has entered with tea and toast . He goes off again . )</stage>
   <stage>Have you seen your doctor lately ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( resignedly ) . Yes , I saw him the other day .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT ( pouring out tea ) . And what did he say ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( confused ) . Well — er — I do n't know — he sounded me .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Yes , they always do that . I wonder why . Your illness has nothing to do with your heart has it ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( firmly ) . My dear Anne , I have n't got an illness .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . I 'm sure I hope not , dear , but if he said that , I should really get another more expert opinion if I were you . A man like that can n't be really reliable . I do n't believe in doctors ever since poor Millicent Jenkins died .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Look here , Anne , I really do want to make you understand that what I told the children is perfectly true . I have n't any money .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . Nonsense , dear , you can n't pull my leg as easily as that . How were you able to send that cheque when I most needed it , and those lovely Christmas presents , and the fares backwards and forwards to America — I believe you 've got some big surprise for us all later on and you 're afraid that we 'll guess it .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Yes , I have .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT ( rising ) . Now look here , dear , I must leave you for a little while . Saturday is the busiest morning in the whole week . Finish off your breakfast and smoke a pipe — or a cigar or something ; if any of the children come near you , just ignore them or pretend to be frightfully angry with them . That will bring them round .</stage>
   <stage>( Enter GRIGGS hurriedly , R .)</stage>
   <stage>GRIGGS . If you please , madam , the boiler is making the most peculiar noises . Shall I send for Brown to come and look at it ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . I do n't think that will do it any good , but still perhaps you 'd better . I 'll come myself in a minute .</stage>
   <stage>( Exit GRIGGS , R .)</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT ( C .) . Really , everything is going wrong this morning , first you , Danny , then the boiler ; sometimes life is n't worth living — I do hope it wo n't burst .</stage>
   <stage>( Exit MRS. DERMOTT , R. DANIEL sits thoughtful for a moment and then resumes his breakfast . Enter JOYCE from garden . She sees UNCLE DANIEL and comes rather sheepishly up to him . )</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . Uncle , I ——</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( gruffly ) . Good morning .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE ( feebly ) . Good morning . ( There is a long pause . ) Uncle Daniel — we 've — er — we 've all been talking ——</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . That 's quite a natural and healthy occupation .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . We — we were talking about you .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . That makes it none the less natural or healthy .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . Of course it did n't . You see — I mean to say — we — well , they sent me in to tell you that ——</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Perhaps you 'd better tell me another time when you are more in the mood . Have you seen the papers anywhere ?</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE . They ought to be over there . ( She points to window seat R ., and goes down to BOBBIE 'S chair . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( rising and moving quickly to R .) . Thanks . Do n't you bother — I can get my own paper . ( Gets newspaper and returns to his seat at the head of the table . )</stage>
   <stage>( There is a long silence , DANIEL reads the paper . JOYCE shakes her head as OLIVER strolls in from the garden and looks at JOYCE for news . )</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . Have you had your breakfast , uncle ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Yes , thank you , and I slept beautifully .</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . It 's a jolly nice morning .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . That remark makes up in truth for what it lacks in originality .</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . Oh . ( Moves to window , L. C ., turns , catches DANIEL 'S eye and turns quickly back . )</stage>
   <stage>( JOYCE continues to fidget at the foot of the table . Enter BOBBIE downstairs and EVANGELINE , R. They look meaningly at JOYCE , who shakes her head vigorously . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Have you a headache , Joyce , you keep wagging it about .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE ( very politely ) . No , thank you , uncle , I ——</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Splendid , then I sha n't have to offer you an aspirin .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE and BOBBIE ( together , coming forward hand-in-hand down R. C . ) . Uncle , we 've all been —— SPACELEFT ( They stop . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . Yes ?</stage>
   <stage>( There is business of each of them wishing the other to speak to DANIEL . )</stage>
   <stage>Tell me one thing , if any of you are capable of uttering a word , is this a game ? Have I got to guess whether something 's a vegetable or a mineral or something ?</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . No , uncle , it 's a much harder game than that — for us , anyhow . We 've come to apologise .</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( lowering the paper ) . Oh , have you ? ( Turns to them . )</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . Oh , wo n't you please be nice and make it easier for us ?</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL . You none of you made things in the least easy for me .</stage>
   <stage>EVANGELINE . I know we did n't , but we 're all sorry — frightfully sorry — we 've talked it all over . Sylvia said we were beasts and ghouls and we would n't admit it then , but we do now . We are terribly ashamed of the way we 've behaved . Please , please say you forgive us . ( Kneels to him . )</stage>
   <stage>BOBBIE ( placing chair behind Chesterfield ) . And it does n't matter about Faith , uncle , I 'm glad you were the means of showing her up . I do n't love her a bit now . I hate her , and we all want you to understand that we 'd rather have you alive and with us than all the beastly money in the world .</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE ( leaning forward over table ) . And we 'll do anything you like to atone for it . We 'll abase ourselves like they used to in the olden days to show they repented .</stage>
   <stage>OLIVER . Will you let it go at that , uncle ? ( He comes forward to L. of DANIEL . )</stage>
   <stage>DANIEL ( softly ) . I should just think I will . ( Kisses EVANGELINE . )</stage>
   <stage>( JOYCE comes round and kisses him . OLIVER moves down L. EVANGELINE moves behind table . )</stage>
   <stage>JOYCE ( running to R .) . Sylvia ! Sylvia ! Mother , come here ! It 's all right !</stage>
   <stage>( Enter MRS. DERMOTT from R .)</stage>
   <stage>MRS. DERMOTT . I 've just come out of the boiler . What on earth is all this noise ?</stage>
