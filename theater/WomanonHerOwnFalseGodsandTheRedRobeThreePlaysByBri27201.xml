      <head>PREFACE</head>
      <p n="1">We are confronted at the present time by the woman who is anxious to lay by means for her own support irrespective of the protection of her husband . In this play I have indicated the tendency of this difficulty and the consequent troubles which the older civilizations will bring upon themselves when the woman 's standing as a worker is generally acknowledged . My conclusion , namely , that all these complications and troubles are , at present at any rate , owing to the education of the man , points to the remedy , as far as I can see it .</p>
      <p n="2">I must inform my readers that the version of LA FEMME SEULE , a translation of which is now published in this volume , has , so far , not appeared in France and is unknown there ; at least as regards the larger part of the third act . I might , did I think it advisable , reproduce in its entirety a text which certain timidities have led me to emasculate .</p>
      <p n="3">As between the man and the woman the ideal situation would , no doubt , be a rehabilitation of the old custom — the man at the workshop and the woman in the home ; thus reserving for her the holiest and most important of all missions — the one which insures the future of the race by her enlightened care of the moral and physical health of her children .</p>
      <p n="4">Unfortunately it happens that the wages of the working-man are insufficient for the support of a family , and the poor woman is therefore compelled to go to the factory . The results are deplorable . The child is either entirely abandoned , or given to the State , and the solidarity of the family suffers in consequence .</p>
      <p n="5">Then again a generation of women with new ideas has arisen , who think they should have , if they wish it , the right to live alone and by themselves , without a husband 's protection . However much some of us may regret this attitude , it is one which must be accepted , since I cannot believe that the worst tyrants would dare to make marriage obligatory . These women have a right to live , and consequently a right to work . Also there are the widows and the abandoned women .</p>
      <p n="6">Women first took places which seemed best fit for them , and which the men turned over to them because the work appeared to be of a character suitable to the feminine sex . But the modern woman has had enough of the meagre salary which is to be obtained by means of needle-work , and she has invaded the shop , the office , the desks of the banks and post office . In industry also she has taken her place by the side of the working-man , who has made room for her first with ironical grace , then with grumbling , and sometimes with anger . I believe that in Europe at least this kind of difficulty will have to be faced in the future .</p>
      <p n="7">As to the rich woman ( and in LA FEMME SEULE I have treated this subject only slightly because it is one to which I expect to come back ) , they have been driven from the home where the progress of domestic science has left them very little to do . We have reached a kind of hypocritical form of State Socialism , or perhaps it would be better to say Collectivism , and this will profoundly change the moral outlook . All , or nearly all , of the work of the home seems to be done by people from the outside — from the cleaning of the windows to the education of the children . The modern home is but a fireside around which one hardly sees the family gathered for intimate talk .</p>
      <p n="8">It has thus happened that the woman who finds herself without work , and with several children , looks out of the windows of her home away from it for the employment of her activities . The future will tell us whether or no this is good . In my opinion I believe it will be good , and I believe that man will gain , through this new intelligence , in the direction of the larger life which has come to women from this necessity of theirs . Unquestionably there will have to be a new education , and this will certainly come .</p>
      <p n="9">LA FOI .— This play is , without doubt , of all my plays the one which has cost me the most labor and the one upon which I have expended the most thought and time . The impulse to write it came to me at Lourdes in view of the excited , suffering , and praying crowds of people . When the thought of writing it came to me I hesitated , but during many years I added notes upon notes . And it was while on a trip to Egypt that I saw the possibility for discussing such questions in the theatre without giving offence to various consciences . My true and illustrious friend , Camille Saint-Saëns , has been kind enough to underline my prose with his admirable music . In this way LA FOI has been produced on the stage at Monte Carlo for the first time under the auspices of His Royal Highness the Prince of Monaco , whom I now beg to thank .</p>
      <p n="10">English readers of LA ROBE ROUGE would , I think , be somewhat misled , if they did not understand the difference between the procedure in criminal cases in France and in Great Britain . My purpose in this preface is to attempt to show that difference in a few words .</p>
      <p n="11">With you , a criminal trial is conducted publicly and before a jury ; with us in France it is carried on in the Chambers of the Judge with only the lawyer present . There sometimes result from this latter method dramas of the kind of which my play LA ROBE ROUGE is one . The judge , too directly interested and free of the criticism which might fall on him from the general public , is liable to the danger of forming for himself an opinion as to the guilt of the accused . He may do this in perfect good faith , but sometimes runs the risk of falling into grave error . It thus occasionally happens that he is anxious not so much to know the truth as to prove that he was right in his own , often rash , opinion .</p>
      <p n="12">LA ROBE ROUGE is a criticism of certain judicial proceedings which obtain in France ; but it is also a study of an individual case of professional crookedness . We should be greatly mistaken were we to draw the dangerous conclusion that all French judges resemble Mouzon , and we should be equally wrong were we to condemn too hastily the French code relating to criminal trials .</p>
      <p n="13">In the struggle of society with the criminal it is very difficult , perhaps impossible , for the legislator to hold in equal balance the rights of the individual as against the interests of society . The balance sometimes leans one way and sometimes the other ; and had I been an English citizen , instead of writing a play against the abuse of justice by a judge , I might have had to illustrate the same abuse by the lawyer .</p>
      <p n="14">I wish most sincerely that these three plays may interest the people of England and America . The problems which I have studied I am sure I have not brought to their final solutions . My ambition was to draw and keep the attention of honest people on them by means of the theatre .</p>

      <head type="act">ACT I</head>
      <stage type="setting">
       <stage>SCENE :— A Louis XV sitting-room . To the right a large recessed window with small panes of glass which forms a partition dividing the sitting-room from an inner room . A heavy curtain on the further side shuts out this other room . There are a table and piano and doors to the right and at the back . The place is in disorder . One of the panes in the large window has been taken out and replaced by a movable panel . It is October .</stage>
       <stage>Madame Guéret is sitting at a table . She is a woman of forty-five , dressed for the afternoon , cold and distinguished looking . Monsieur Guéret , who is with her , is about fifty-five and is wearing a frock coat . He is standing beside his wife .</stage>
      </stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Then you really do n't want me to go and hear the third act ? MADAME GUÉRET [ dryly ] I think as I 've been let in for these theatricals solely to please your goddaughter you may very well keep me company . Besides , my brother is coming back and he has something to say to you . GUÉRET [ resignedly ] Very well , my dear . A pause .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . I can n't get over it .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Over what ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . What we 're doing . What are we doing ?</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . We 're giving a performance of Barberine for the amusement of our friends . There 's nothing very extraordinary in that .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Do n't make fun of me , please . What we are doing is simply madness . Madness , do you hear ? And it was the day before yesterday — only the day before yesterday — we heard the news .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . We — MADAME GUÉRET [ Who has seen Lucienne come in ] Hush ! Lucienne comes in , a girl of twenty , dressed as Barberine from Musset 's play ; then Maud , Nadia , and Antoinette [ eighteen to twenty-two ] , dressed as followers of the queen . Lucienne goes to the piano , takes a piece of music , and comes to Madame Guéret .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>You 'll help me along , wo n't you , dear Madame Guéret ? You 'll give me my note when it comes to “ Voyez vous pas que la nuit est profonde ” ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Now do n't be nervous . MAUD [ coming in ] We 're ready .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ANTOINETTE</speaker>
       <p>If the third act only goes as well as the first two —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MAUD</speaker>
       <p>We 'll listen until we have to go on .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ANTOINETTE</speaker>
       <p>Wo n't you come with us , Madame ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . No , I can n't . I 've had to undertake the noises behind the scenes . That job might have been given to someone else , I think .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , Madame , please do n't be angry with us . Madame Chain let us know too late . And you 're helping us so much .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Well , I 've invited the people , and I suppose I must entertain them . As I gave in to Thérèse about getting up this play , I do n't want to do anything to spoil the evening .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>How pretty she is as Kalekairi .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . You do n't think people are shocked by her frock ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , Madame !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Well !</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>I shall have to go in a moment . Thérèse has come out ; I can hear her sequins rattling .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Yes ; so can I . But René will let us know . Never mind . She goes to the piano . René appears at the door at the back .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Are you ready , Lucienne ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>Yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>RENÉ . You 've only two lines to say .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>Only one .<stage>She speaks low to René</stage>No end of a success , was n't it , for your Thérèse ? RENÉ<stage>low</stage>Was n't it ? I am so happy , Lucienne . I love her so .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>Listen . That 's for me , I think .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>RENÉ . Yes , that 's for you . Wait . [ He goes to the door at the back , listens , and returns ] Come . Turn this way so as to make it sound as if you were at a distance . Now then . Madame Guéret accompanies Lucienne on the piano . LUCIENNE [ sings ] Beau chevalier qui partez pour la guerre , Qu'allez vous faire Si loin d'ici ? Voyez-vous pas que la nuit est profonde Et que le monde N'est que souci . MADAME GUÉRET [ civilly ] You have a delightful voice , Mademoiselle Lucienne . Lucienne places her music on the piano with a smile to Madame Guéret . RENÉ [ to Lucienne , drawing her to the partition window and showing her where a pane has been removed ] And your little window ! Have you seen your little window ? It was not there at the dress rehearsal . You lift it like this . It 's supposed to be an opening in the wall . It ought to have been different ; we were obliged to take out a pane . May I show her , Madame Guéret ? MADAME GUÉRET [ resigned ] Yes , yes , of course .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . You lift it like this ; and to speak you 'll lean forward , wo n't you , so that they may see you ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>I will , yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>RENÉ . Do n't touch it now . [ To Madame Guéret ] You wo n't forget the bell , will you , Madame ? There 's plenty of time — ten minutes at least . I 'll let you know . Mademoiselle Lucienne , now , time to go on .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , yes .<stage>She goes out</stage>MADAME GUÉRET<stage>with a sigh</stage>To have a play being acted in the circumstances we 're in — it 's beyond everything ! I cannot think how I came to allow it .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>GUÉRET . You see they 'd been rehearsing for a week . And Thérèse —</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . And I not only allowed it , but I 'm almost taking part in it .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . We could n't put off all these people at twenty-four hours ’ notice . And it 's our last party . It 's really a farewell party . Besides , we should have had to tell Thérèse everything .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Well , you asked me to keep it all from her until to-morrow — though it concerns her as much as it does us . [ Monsieur Féliat comes in , a man of sixty , correct without being elegant ] Here 's my brother .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . I 've something to tell you . Shall we be interrupted ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Yes , constantly .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Let 's go into another room .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . I can n't . And all the rooms are full of people .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Marguerite has been good enough to help here by taking the place of Madame Chain , who 's ill. MADAME GUÉRET [ angrily ] Yes , I 've got to do the noises heard off ! At my age ! [ A sigh ] Tell us , Etienne , what is it ?</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . We can wait until the play is over .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . So like you ! You do n't care a bit about what my brother has to tell us . Who 'd ever believe this is all your fault ! [ To her brother ] What is it ?</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . I have seen the lawyer . Your goddaughter will have to sign this power of attorney so that it may get to Lyons to-morrow morning . GUÉRET [ who has glanced at the paper ] But we can n't get her to sign that without telling her all about it .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Well , goodness me , she 'll have to know sometime ! I must say I cannot understand the way you 've kept this dreadful thing from her . It 's pure sentimentality .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . The poor child !</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . You really are ridiculous . One would think that it was only her money the lawyer took . It 's gone , of course ; but so is ours .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . We still have La Tremblaye .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Yes , thank goodness , because La Tremblaye belongs to me . René comes in in great excitement .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Where is Mademoiselle Thérèse ? She 'll keep the stage waiting ! [ Listening ] No , she 's coming , I hear her . Nice fright she 's given me ! [ To Madame Guéret ] Above all , Madame , do n't forget the bell , almost the moment that Mademoiselle Thérèse comes off the stage .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Yes , yes .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . And my properties ! [ He runs out</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Now we can talk for a minute .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Yes .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . You 've quite made up your minds to come to Evreux ?</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Quite .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Are you sure you wo n't regret Paris ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Oh , no .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . For the last two years I 've hated Paris .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Since you began to play cards .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . For the last two years we 've had the greatest difficulty in keeping up appearances . This lawyer absconding is the last blow .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Are n't you afraid you will be horribly bored at La Tremblaye ? GUÉRET [ rising ] What are we to do ?</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Well , now listen to me . I told you — René comes in and takes something off a table . Féliat stops suddenly .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Good-morning , uncle . [ He hurries out</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Good-morning , René .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . He knows nothing about it yet ?</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . No ; and my sister-in-law asked me to tell him .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Well , why should n't you ? If they are engaged , we know nothing about it .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Oh !</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . We know nothing officially , because in these days young people do n't condescend to consult their parents .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . René told his people and they gave their consent .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Unwillingly .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Oh certainly , unwillingly . Then I 'm to tell him ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . The sooner the better .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . I 'll tell him to-night .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . I 'm afraid it 'll be an awful blow to the poor chap .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Oh , he 's young . He 'll get over it .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . What was I saying when he came in ? Ah , yes ; you know I 've decided to add a bindery to my printing works at Evreux ; you saw the building started when you were down there . If things go as I want them to , I shall try to do some cheap artistic binding . I want to get hold of a man who wo n't rob me to manage this new branch and look after it ; a man who wo n't be too set in his ideas , because I want him to adopt mine ; and , at the same time , I 'd like him to be not altogether a stranger . I thought I 'd found him ; but I saw the man yesterday and I do n't like him . Now will you take on the job ? Would it suit you ?</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Would it suit me ! Oh , my dear Féliat , how can I possibly thank you ? To tell you the truth , I 've been wondering what in the world I should do with myself now ; and I was dreading the future . What you offer me is better than anything I could have dreamt of . What do you say , Marguerite ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . I am delighted .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Then that 's all right . GUÉRET [ to his brother-in-law ] I think you wo n't regret having confidence in me .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . And your goddaughter ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Thérèse ?</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Yes ; how is she going to face this double news of her ruin and the breaking off of her engagement ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . I think she ought to have sense enough to understand that one is the consequence of the other . She can hardly expect René 's parents to give their son to a girl without money .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . I suppose not . But what 's to become of her ?</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . She will live with us , of course .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . “ Of course ” ! I like that .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . She has no other relations , and her father left her in my care .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . He left her in your care , and it 's I who have been rushed into all the trouble of a child who is nothing to me .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Child ! She was nineteen when her father died .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . To look after a young girl of nineteen is a very great responsibility . MADAME GUÉRET [ laughing bitterly ] Ho ! Ho ! Look after ! Look after Mademoiselle Thérèse ! You think she 's a person who allows herself to be looked after ! And yet you 've seen her more or less every holidays .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . You 've not had to look after her ; she has been at the Lycée . Thérèse comes in dressed as Kalekairi from “ Barberine . ” She is a pretty girl of twenty-three , healthy , and bright .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . The bell , the bell , godmother ! You 're forgetting the bell ! Good-evening , Monsieur Féliat . Thérèse takes up the bell , which is on the table .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . I was going to forget it ! Oh , what a nuisance ! All this is so new to me .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Excuse me ! I really did n't recognize you for the moment . THÉRÈSE [ laughing ] Ah , my dress . Startling , is n't it ? MADAME GUÉRET [ with meaning ] Startling is the right word . RENÉ [ appearing at the back , disappearing again immediately , and calling ] The bell ! And you , on the stage , Mademoiselle Thérèse !</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I 'm coming . [ She rings ] Here I am ! She goes out . MADAME GUÉRET [ with a sigh ] And I had it let down !</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . What ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Her dress . [ To her husband ] What I see most clearly in all this is that she must stay with us . René comes fussing in .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Where 's the queen ? Where 's Madame Nérisse ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . I 've not seen her .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . But goodness gracious —! [ He goes to the door on the left and calls ] Madame Nérisse ! MADAME NÉRISSE [ from outside ] Yes , yes , I 'm ready . Madame Nérisse comes in . She is about forty , flighty , and a little affected .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . I wanted to warn you that Ulric will be on your right , and if he plays the fool —</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Very well . Is it time ?</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Yes , come . [ To Madame Guéret ] You wo n't forget the trumpets ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . No , no . All the same , you 'd better help me .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . I will , I will . He goes out with Madame Nérisse .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . You know , if she wants one , she 'll find a husband at Evreux .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Without a penny !</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Without a penny ! She made a sensation at the ball at the sous-préfecture . She 's extremely pretty .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . She 's young .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Monsieur Gambard sounded me about her .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Monsieur Gambard ! The Monsieur Gambard who has the house with the big garden ?</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Yes .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . But he 's very rich .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . He 's forty-nine .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . She 'll have to take what she can get now .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . And I think that Monsieur Beaudoin ——</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . But he 's almost a cripple !</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . She would n't do so well in Paris .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . She would n't look at either of them .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . We must try and make her see reason . René enters busily . Lucienne follows him . Féliat is standing across the guichet through which Barberine is to speak . René pulls him away without ceremony .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Excuse me , Uncle ; do n't stand there before the little window .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Beg pardon . I did n't know .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . I have n't a moment .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . I 've never seen you so busy . At your office they say you 're a lazy dog .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Probably René has more taste for the stage than for business . RENÉ [ laughing ] Rather ! [ To Lucienne ] Now , it 's time . Come . Lift it . Not yet ! There ! Now ! LUCIENNE [ speaking through the guichet ] “ If you want food and drink , you must do like those old women you despise — you must spin . ”</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Capital ! LUCIENNE [ to Féliat ] Please forgive me , Monsieur , I 've not had time to speak to you .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Why , it 's Mademoiselle Lucienne , Thérèse 's friend , who came and stayed in the holidays ! Fancy my not recognizing you !</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>It 's my dress . I do like playing this part . I have to say that lovely bit — you know — the bit that describes the day of the ideal wife .<stage>She recites , sentimentally</stage>“ I rise and go to prayers , to the farmyard , to the kitchen . I prepare your meal ; I go with you to church ; I read a page or two ; I sew a while ; and then I fall asleep happy upon your breast . ”</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . That 's good , oh , that 's very good ! Barberine — now , who wrote that ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>Alfred de Musset .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Ah , yes ; to be sure , Alfred de Musset . I read him when I was young . You often find his works lying about in pretty bindings .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Uncle , Uncle ; I beg your pardon , but do n't speak so loud . We can hardly hear what they 're saying on the stage . FÉLIAT [ very politely ] Sorry , I 'm sure . RENÉ [ to Lucienne ] You . Now . LUCIENNE [ speaking through the guichet ] “ My lord , these cries are useless . It grows late . If you wish to sup — you must spin . ” [ turning to the others ] There ! Now I must go over the rest with Ulric . She runs out , with a little wave of adieu to Féliat . RENÉ [ to Madame Guéret ] The trumpets , Madame . Do n't forget .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . No , no . Do n't worry . René goes out .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . You blow trumpets ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Yes ; on the piano .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . I do n't know what to do with myself . I do n't want to be in the way . I 'm not accustomed to being behind the scenes .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Nor am I. Thérèse comes in in the Kalekairi dress , followed by René .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . It 's time for me now . FÉLIAT [ to Madame Guéret ] She really looks like a professional actress . RENÉ [ to Thérèse ] Now ! THÉRÈSE [ speaking through the little window ] “ My lady says , as you will not spin , you cannot sup . She thinks you are not hungry , and I wish you good-night . ” [ She closes the little window and says gayly ] Good-evening , Monsieur Féliat .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Now then , come along . You go on in one minute . THÉRÈSE [ to Féliat ] I 'll come back soon . She goes out . RENÉ [ to Madame Guéret ] Now , Madame , you , Quick , Madame !</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Yes , yes . All right . She plays a flourish of trumpets on the piano .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Splendid !</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Ouf ! It 's over . At last we can have peace ! If she 's such a fool as to refuse both these men — GUÉRET [ interrupting ] She wo n't refuse , you may be sure . MADAME GUÉRET [ continuing ] — we shall have to keep her with us . But I shall insist upon certain conditions .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . What conditions ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . I wo n't have any scandals at Evreux .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . There wo n't be any scandals .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . No ; because she 'll have to behave very differently , I can tell you . She 'll have to leave all these fine airs of independence behind her in Paris .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . What airs ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Well , for instance , getting letters and answering them without any sort of supervision ! [ To her brother ] She manages in such a way that I do n't even see the envelopes ! [ To her husband ] I object very much , too , to her student ways .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . She goes to classes and lectures with her girl friends .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Well , she wo n't go to any more . And she will have to give up going out alone .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . She 's of age .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . A properly brought up young lady is never of age .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Perfectly true .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . And there must be a change in her way of dressing .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . There will . She 'll have to dress simply , for she wo n't have a rap .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . That has nothing to do with it . I shall make her understand that she will have to behave like the other girls in good society .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Of course .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . I shall also put a veto on certain books she reads . [ To her brother ] It 's really dreadful , Etienne . You 've no idea ! One day I found a shocking book upon her table — a horror ! What do you suppose she said when I remonstrated ? That that disgraceful book was necessary in preparing for her examination . And the worst of it is , it was true . She showed me the syllabus .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . I 'm afraid they 're bringing up our girls in a way that 'll make unhappy women of them .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Do n't let 's talk about it ; you 'll start on politics , and then you and Henri will begin to argue . All the same I mean to be very good to her . As soon as she knows what 's happened her poor little pretensions will come tumbling about her ears . I wo n't leave her in uncertainty , and even before she asks I 'll tell her she may stay with us ; but I shall tell her , too , what I expect from her in return .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Would n't it be better —</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . My dear , I shall go my own way . See what we 're suffering now in consequence of going yours . Here 's Madame Nérisse . Then the play is over . [ To her husband ] You must go and look after the people at the supper table . I 'll join you in a minute .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . All right . He goes out .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . I 've hardly ever been at such a successful party . I wanted to congratulate dear Thérèse , but she 's gone to change her dress . MADAME GUÉRET [ absently ] So glad . Were you speaking of having a notice of it in your paper ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Of your play ! If I was going to notice it ! I should think so ! The photographs we had taken at the dress rehearsal are being developed . We shall have a wonderful description . MADAME GUÉRET [ imploring ] Could it be stopped ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . It 's not possible ! Just think how amazed the subscribers to Feminine Art would be if they found nothing in their paper about your lovely performance of Barberine , even if the editress of the paper had n't taken a part in the play . If it only depended on me , perhaps I could find some way out — explain it in some way , just to please you . But then there 's your charming Thérèse — one of our contributors . I can n't tell you what a wonderful success she 's had with her two stories , illustrated by herself . People adore her .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Nobody would know anything about it —</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Nobody know ! There are at least ten people among your guests who will send descriptions of this party to the biggest morning papers , simply for the sake of getting their own names into print . If Feminine Art had nothing about it , it would be thought extremely odd , I assure you . [ She turns to Féliat ] Would n't it , Monsieur ?</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Pardon me , Madame , I know nothing about these things .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Well , we 'll say no more about it .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . But what 's the matter ? You must have some very good reason for not wanting me to put in anything about your delightful party .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . No —— only —— [ Hesitating ] Some of our family are country people , you know . It would take me too long to explain it all to you . It does n't matter . [ With a change of tone ] Then honestly you think Thérèse has some little talent ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Little talent ! No , but very great talent . Have n't you read her two articles ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Oh , I ? I belong to another century . In my days it would have been considered a very curious thing if a young girl wrote novels . My brother feels this too . By the way , I have not introduced my brother to you . Monsieur Féliat , of Evreux — Madame Nérisse , editress of Feminine Art . Madame Nérisse has been kind enough to help us with our little party . [ To Madame Nérisse ] Yes — you were speaking about — what was it — this story that Thérèse has written . No doubt your readers were indulgent to the work of a little amateur .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . I wish I could find professionals who 'd do half as well . I 'm perfectly certain the number her photograph is going to be in will have a good sale .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . You 'll publish her photograph ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . In her dress as Kalekairi .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . In her dress as Kalekairi !</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . On the front page . They tell me it 's a first-rate likeness . I 'll bring you one of them before long , and your country relations will be delighted . If you 'll excuse me , I 'll hurry away and change my dress .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Oh , please excuse me for keeping you .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Good-bye for the present . [ She goes to the door ] I was looking for Maud and Nadia to take them away with me . I see them over there having a little flirtation . [ She looks through the door and speaks pleasantly to Maud and Nadia , who are just outside ] All right , all right ; I wo n't interrupt . [ To Madame Guéret ] They 'd much rather come home alone . Good-bye . [ She bows to Féliat ] Good-bye , Monsieur . [ Turning again to Madame Guéret ] Do n't look so upset because you have a goddaughter who can be a great writer or a great painter if she chooses ; just as she would have been a great actress if she had taken a fancy for that . Good-bye again and many congratulations . She goes out .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Well ! Anyway , she 's not my daughter ! I must go and say good-bye to everybody . When I 've got rid of them , I 'll come back and see Thérèse . Will you wait for me ? You 'll find some papers on that little table . Oh , goodness , what times we live in ! Madame Guéret goes out . Féliat , left alone , strolls to the door and looks in the direction in which Madame Nérisse had seen Maud and Nadia . After a moment he shows signs of indignation . FÉLIAT [ shocked ] Oh , I say , this is really — I must cough or something , and let them know I 'm here . [ He coughs ] They 've seen me . They 're waving their hands — and — they ‘ re going on just the same ! Lucienne and Thérèse in ordinary dress come in and notice what Féliat is doing . THÉRÈSE [ to Lucienne ] What is he doing ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>What 's the matter ? They advance to see what has caused his perturbation . He hears them and turns .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . It is incredible !</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . You seem rather upset . What 's the matter ?</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . What 's the matter ? Those girls are behaving in such a scandalous way with those young men .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>Let 's see .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Oh , do n't look ! [ Suddenly stopping , half to himself ] Though I must say — THÉRÈSE [ laughing ] What must you say ?</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Nothing .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>I know . You mean that we 're just as bad .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . No , no , not as bad .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , yes ; well — almost .<stage>Féliat makes a sign of protest</stage>I saw you watching us yesterday after the rehearsal ! You saw I was flirting , and I know you imagined all sorts of horrid things . Our little flirtations are not what you think . When we flirt we play at love-making with our best boys , just as once upon a time we played at mothering with our dolls .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . But that does n't justify —</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . You do n't understand . People spoil us while we 're children , and then look after us so tremendously carefully when we grow up that we guess there must be delightful and dangerous possibilities about us . Flirting is our way of feeling for these possibilities .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>We 're sharpening our weapons .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . But the foils have buttons on them , and the pistols are only loaded with powder .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>And it 's extremely amusing and does no harm to anybody .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Monsieur Féliat , you 've read bad books . Nowadays girls like us are neither bread-and-butter misses nor demi-vierges . We 're perfectly respectable young people . Quite capable and self-possessed and , at the same time , quite straight and very happy .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . I 'm perfectly sure of it , my dear young ladies . But you know I 've had a great deal of experience .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Oh , experience ! Well , you know —</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , experience !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . You say you have experience ; that only means you know about the past better than we do . But we know much better than you do about the present .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . I think those girls there are playing a dangerous game .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . You need n't have the smallest anxiety about them .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . That way of going on might get them into great trouble .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . It wo n't , I assure you . Monsieur Féliat , believe me , you know nothing about it .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>We 're clever enough to be able to take care of ourselves .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . But there are certain things that take you by storm .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>Not us . Flirting is an amusement , a distraction , a game .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Shall we say a safety valve ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>There 's not a single one of us who does n't understand the importance of running straight . And , to do them justice , these boys have no idea of tempting us to do anything else . What they want , what we all really want , is a quite conventional , satisfactory marriage .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . I most heartily approve ; but in my days so much wisdom did n't usually come from such fascinating little mouths .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Now how can you blame us when you see that really we think exactly as you do yourself ?</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . In my days girls went neither to the Lycée nor to have gymnastic lessons , and they were none the less straight . LUCIENNE [ reflectively ] And yet they grew up into the women of to-day . I get educated and try to keep myself healthy , with exercises and things , because I want to develop morally and physically , and be fit to marry a man a little bit out of the ordinary either in fortune or brains .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . You see our whole lives depend upon the man we marry .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . I seem to have heard that before .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>Yes ; so 've I . But it 's none the less true for that .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Is n't it funny that we seem to be saying the most shocking things when we 're only repeating what our grandfathers and grandmothers preached to their children ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>They were quite right . Love does n't make happiness by itself . One has to consider the future . We do consider it ; in fact we do nothing else but consider it . We want to get the best position for ourselves in the future that we possibly can . We 're not giddy little fools , and we 're not selfish egotists . We want our children to grow up happy and capable as we 've done ourselves . We 're really quite reasonable . FÉLIAT<stage>hardly able to contain himself</stage>You are ; indeed you are . It makes one shudder . Excuse me , I 'm going to supper .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>Let 's all go together .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Thanks , I can find my way .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>It 's down that passage to the right .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Yes , I shall find it , thank you . He goes out .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . You shocked the poor old boy .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>I only flavored the truth just enough to make it tasty . But</l>
        <l>I 've something frightfully important to tell you . It 's settled .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . What 's settled ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>I 'm engaged .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . You do n't say so .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>It 's done . Armand has been to his people and they 've come to see mine . So I need n't play any more piano , nor sing any more sentimental songs ; I need n't be clever any more , nor flirt any more , nor languish at young men any more . And how do you suppose it was settled ? Just what one would n't have ever expected . You know my people were doing all they could to dress me up , and show me off , and seem to be richer than they are , so as to attract the men . On my side I was giving myself the smartest of airs and pretending to despise money and to think of nothing but making a splash . Everything went quite differently from what I expected . I wanted to attract Armand , and I was only frightening him off . He thought such a woman as I was pretending to be too expensive . It was just through a chance conversation , some sudden confidence on my part , that he found out that I really like quite simple things . He was delighted , and he proposed at once .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Dear Lucienne , I 'm so glad . I hope you 'll be very , very happy .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>Ah , that 's another story . Armand is not by any means perfect . But what can one do ? The important thing is to marry , is n't it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Of course . Well , if your engagement is on , mine 's off .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>Thérèse ! Why I 've just been talking to René . I never saw him so happy , nor so much in love .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . He does n't know yet . Or perhaps they 're telling him now .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>Telling him what ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I 've lost all my money , my dear .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>Lost all your money !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes . The lawyer who had my securities has gone off with them .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>When ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I heard about it the day before yesterday . Godpapa and godmamma were so awfully good they never said anything to me about it , though they 're losing a lot of money too . They thought I had n't heard , and I expect they wanted me to have this last evening 's fun . I said nothing , and so nobody knows anything except you , now , and probably René .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>What will you do ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . What can I do ? It 's impossible for him to marry me without a penny . Of course I shall release him from his promise .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>You think he 'll give you up ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . His people will make him . If they cut off his allowance , he 'll be at their mercy . He earns about twenty dollars a month in that lawyer 's office . So , you see —</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>Oh ! poor Thérèse ! And you could play Barberine with a secret like that ! THÉRÈSE<stage>sadly</stage>I 've had a real bad time since I heard . It 's awful at night !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>My dearest ! And you love him so ! THÉRÈSE<stage>much moved</stage>Yes — oh ! do n't make me cry .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>It might do you good !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . You know — [ She breaks down a little ] LUCIENNE [ tenderly ] Yes — I know that you 're good and brave .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I shall have to be .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>Then you 'll break off the engagement ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes . I shall never see him again .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>Never see him again !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I shall write to him . If I saw him I should probably break down . If I write I shall be more likely to be able to make him feel that we must resign ourselves to the inevitable .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>He 'll be horribly unhappy .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . So shall I . [ Low and urgently ] Oh , if he only understood me ! If he was able to believe that I can earn my own living and that he could earn his . If he would dare to do without his people 's consent !</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>Persuade him to !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . It 's quite impossible . His people are rich . Only just think what they 'd suspect me of . No ; I shall tell him all the things his father will tell him . But oh ! Lucienne , if he had an answer for them ! If he had an answer ! [ She cries a little ] But , my poor René , he wo n't make any stand .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>How you love him !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Oh , yes ; I love him . He 's rather weak , but he 's so loyal and good and [ in a very low voice ] loving .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , my dear , I do pity you so .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I am to be pitied , really . [ Pulling herself together ] There 's one thing . I shall take advantage of this business to separate from godpapa and godmamma .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>But you have no money —</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I 've not been any too happy here . You know they 're — [ She sees Madame Guéret and whispers to Lucienne ] Go now . I 'll tell you all about it to-morrow . [ Louder and gayly ] Well , good-night , my dear . See you to-morrow at the Palais de Glace or at the Sorbonne ! Good-night .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Good-night , Thérèse .</l>
        <l>She goes out .</l>
        <l>MADAME GUÉRET</l>
        <stage>speaking through the door</stage>
        <l>Yes , she 's here . Come in .</l>
        <stage>Guéret and Féliat come in</stage>
        <l>Thérèse , we have something to say to you .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes , godmamma .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . It 's about something important ; something very serious . Let us sit down .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . You 'll have to be brave , Thérèse .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . We are ruined , and you are ruined too .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Is that all you have to say ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I knew it already .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . You knew it ? Who told you ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . The lawyer told me himself . I had a long letter from him yesterday . He begs me to forgive him .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Well , I declare !</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I 'll show it to you . He 's been gambling . To get a bigger fortune for his girls , he says .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . You knew it ! And you 've had the strength , the — duplicity ? THÉRÈSE [ smiling ] Just as you had yourself , godmamma . And I 'm so much obliged to both of you for saying nothing to me , because I 'm sure you wanted me to have my play to-night and enjoy myself ; and that was why you tried to keep the news from me .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . And you were able to laugh and to act !</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I 've always tried to keep myself in hand .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Oh , I know . All the same — And I was so careful about breaking this news to you , and you knew it all the time !</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I 'm very sorry . But you —</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . All right , all right . Well , then , we have nothing to tell . But do you understand that you 've not a penny left ?</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . You 're to go on living with us , of course . MADAME GUÉRET [ to her husband ] You really might have given her time to ask us . [ To Thérèse ] We take it that you have asked us , and we answer that we will keep you with us .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . We are going to Evreux . My brother-in-law is giving me work in his factory .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . We will keep you with us , but on certain conditions .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Thank you very much , godmamma , but I mean to stay in Paris .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . You do n't understand . We are going to live at Evreux .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . But I am going to live in Paris .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Then it is I who do not understand .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . All the same — [ A silence</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . I can hardly believe that you propose to live in Paris by yourself . THÉRÈSE [ simply ] I do , godmamma .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Alone !</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Alone ! I repeat , I do n't understand .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Nor do I . But no doubt you have reasons to give to your godfather and godmother . [ He moves to go</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . There 's no secret about my reasons . All the world may know them . When I 've explained you 'll see that it 's all right .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . I must confess to being extremely curious to hear these reasons .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I do hope my decision wo n't make you angry with me .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Angry ! When have I ever been angry with you ? THÉRÈSE [ protesting ] You 've both been — you 've all three been — most good and kind to me , and I shall always remember it and be grateful . You may be sure I sha n't love you any the less because I shall live in Paris and you at Evreux . And I do beg of you to feel the same to me . I shall never forget what I owe to you . Father was only your friend ; we 're not related in any way : but you took me in , and for four years you 've treated me as if I was your daughter . From my very heart I 'm grateful to you . GUÉRET [ affectionately ] You do n't owe us much , you know . For two years you were a boarder at the Lycée Maintenon , and we saw nothing of you but your letters . You 've only actually lived with us for two years , and you 've been like sunshine in the house .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Yes , indeed .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I 've thought this carefully over . I 'm twenty-three . I wo n't be a burden to you any longer .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Is that because you are too proud and independent ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . If I thought I could really be of use to you , I would stay with you . If I could help you to face your troubles , I would stay with you . But I can n't , and I mean to shift for myself .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . And you think you can “ shift for yourself , ” as you call it , all alone ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes , godmamma .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . A young girl , all alone , in Paris ! The thing is inconceivable .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . But , my poor child , how do you propose to live ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I 'll work .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . You do n't mean that seriously ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes , godmamma .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . You think you have only to ask for work and it will fall from the skies !</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I have a few dollars in my purse which will keep me until I have found something .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Your purse will be empty before you 've made a cent .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I 'm sure it wo n't .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Now , my dear , you 're tired , and nervous , and upset . You can n't look at things calmly . We can talk about this again to-morrow .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes , godpapa . But I sha n't have changed my mind .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . I know you have a strong will of your own .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Let us talk sensibly and reasonably . You propose to live all alone in Paris . Good . Where will you live ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I shall hire a little flat — or a room somewhere .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Like a workgirl .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Like a workgirl . There 's nothing to be ashamed of in that .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . And you are going to earn your own living . How ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I shall work . There 's nothing to be ashamed of in that , either .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . I see . But a properly brought up young lady does n't work for her living if she can possibly avoid it .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . And above all , a properly brought up young lady does n't live all alone .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . All the same —</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . You are perfectly free . There 's no doubt about that . We have no power to prevent you from doing exactly as you choose .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . But your father left you in my care .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Please , godmamma , do n't be hard upon me . I feel you think I 'm ungrateful , though you do n't say so . I know that often and often I shall long for your kindness and for the home where you 've given me a place . I 've shocked you . Do please forgive me . I 'm made like that , and made differently from you . I do n't say you 're not right ; I only say I 'm different . Certain ideas have come to me from being educated at the Lycée and from all these books I 've read . I think I 'm able to earn my own living , and so I look upon it as my bounden duty not to trespass upon your charity . It 's a question of personal dignity . Do n't you think that I 'm right , godfather ? [ With a change of tone ] Besides , if I did go to Evreux with you , what should I do there ?</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . It 's pretty easy to guess .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Yes , indeed .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . You would live with us . MADAME GUÉRET [ not very kindly ] You would have a home .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes , yes , I know all that ; and it would be a great happiness . But what should I do ?</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . You would do what all well brought up young girls in your position do .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . You mean I should do nothing .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Nothing ! No , not nothing .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Pay visits , practise a bit ; some crochet and a little photography ? That 's to say , nothing .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . You were brought up to that .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I should never have dared to put it into words . But afterwards ?</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Afterwards ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . How long would that last ?</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Until you marry .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I shall never marry .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Why not ? THÉRÈSE [ very gently ] Oh , godfather , you know why not . I have no money . [ A silence ] So I 'm going to try and get work .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Work ! Now , Thérèse , you know what women are like who try to earn their own living . You think you can support yourself . How ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Perhaps I 'm mistaken , but I think I can support myself by my pen .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Be a bluestocking ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . That means a Bohemian life , with everything upside down , and a cigarette always between your lips . THÉRÈSE [ laughing ] Neither Bohemia , nor the upside down , nor the cigarette are indispensable , godmother . Your information is neither firsthand nor up-to-date .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . In a month 's time you 'll want to give it up .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Under those circumstances there 's no harm in letting me make the experiment .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Now , my dear child , do n't you know that even with your cleverness you may have to wait years before you make a penny . I 've been an editor . I know what I 'm talking about .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . She 's made up her mind , there 's no use saying any more .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . But I want to talk to her now . Will you be so good as to listen to me , Mademoiselle Thérèse ? [ To Madame Guéret ] I wonder if I might be allowed to have a few minutes with her alone .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . Most willingly . GUÉRET [ to his wife ] Come , Marguerite .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME GUÉRET . It 's no use making up your mind to the worst in these days ; life always keeps a surprise for you . Let 's go . [ She goes out with her husband</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . My child , I have undertaken to say something to you that I fear will hurt you , and it 's very difficult . You know that I 'm only René 's uncle by marriage . So it 's not on my own account that I speak . I speak for his parents .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Do n't say another word , Monsieur Féliat . I perfectly understand . I 'm going to release him from his engagement . I shall write to him this very night .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . My sister-in-law and her husband are most unhappy about all this .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I 'm grateful to you all .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Their affection for you is not in any way diminished .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I know .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . And — THÉRÈSE [ imploringly ] Please , please , Monsieur Féliat , do n't say any more ; what 's the good of it ?</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . I beg your pardon , my dear . I am a little upset . I was expecting — er , er —</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Expecting what ?</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . I expected some resistance on your part , perhaps indignation . It must be very hard for you ; you were very fond of René .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . What 's the good of talking about that ? Of course he can n't marry me now that I 've not got a penny .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . You know — as a matter of fact — I — my old-fashioned ideas — well , you go on surprising me . But this time my surprise is accompanied by — shall I say respect ?— and by sympathy . I expected tears , which would have been very natural , because I know that your affection for René was very great .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I can keep my tears to myself .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Yes —— Oh , I —— at least ——</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Let 's consider it settled . Please do n't talk to me about it any more .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Very well . Now will you allow me to say one word to you about your future ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I sha n't change my mind .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Perhaps not ; all the same I want to advise you like — well , like an old uncle . For several years you have been spending your holidays with me at La Tremblaye . And I have a real affection for you . So you 'll listen to me ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . With all my heart .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . You 're making a mistake . Your ideas do you credit , but believe me , you 're laying up trouble for yourself in the future . [ She makes a movement to interrupt him ] Wait . I do n't want to argue . I want you to listen to me , and I want to persuade you to follow my advice . Come to Evreux and you may be perfectly certain that you wo n't be left an old maid all your life . Even without money you 'll find a husband there . You 're too pretty , too charming , too well educated not to turn the head of some worthy gentleman . You made a sensation at the reception at the Préfecture . If you do n't know that already , I tell you so .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I 'm extremely flattered .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Do you know that if — well , if you decide to marry — I might —</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . But I 've not decided to marry .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . All right , all right , I am speaking about later on . Well , you 've seen Monsieur Baudoin and Monsieur Gambard —</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I have n't the slightest intention of — FÉLIAT [ interrupting ] There 's no question of anything immediate . But for a person as wise and sensible as you are , the position of both the one and the other deserves —</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I know them both .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Yes ; but —</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Now look here . If I had two hundred thousand francs , would you suggest that I should marry either of them ?</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Certainly not .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . There , you see .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . But you 've not got two hundred thousand francs . THÉRÈSE [ without showing any anger or annoyance ] The last thing I want is to be exacting . But really , Monsieur Féliat , think for a minute . If I were to marry a man I could not possibly love , I should marry him for his money . [ Looking straight at him ] And in that case the only difference between me and the women I am not supposed to know anything about would be that a little ceremony had been performed over me and not over them . Do n't you agree with me ?</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . But , my dear , you say such extraordinary things .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Well , do you consider that less dishonoring than working ? Honestly now , do you ? I think that the best thing about women earning their living is that it 'll save them from being put into exactly that position .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . The right thing for woman is marriage . That 's her proper position .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . It 's sometimes an unhappy one . [ A maid comes in bringing a card to Thérèse , who says ] Ask the lady kindly to wait a moment .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MAID</speaker>
       <p>Yes , Mademoiselle .<stage>The maid goes out</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Well , I 'm off . I shall go and see René . Then you 'll write to him ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . This very evening .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . He 'll want to see you . My child , will you have the courage to resist him ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . You need n't trouble about that .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . If he was mad enough to want to do without his parents ’ consent , they wish me to tell you that they would never speak to him again .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I see .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . That he would be a stranger to them . You understand all that that means ? THÉRÈSE [ discouraged ] Yes , yes ; oh yes .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . If you are not strong enough to stand out against his entreaties , you will be his ruin .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I quite understand .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . People would think very badly of you .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Please do n't say any more , I quite understand .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Then I may trust you ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . You may trust me . FÉLIAT [ fatherly and approving ] Thank you . [ He holds out his hand ] Thérèse , you 're — well — you 're splendid . I like courage . I wish you success with all my heart . I really wish you success . But if , in the future , you should want a friend — the very strongest may find themselves in that position — let me be that friend . THÉRÈSE [ taking the hand which Féliat holds out to her ] I 'm grateful , very grateful , Monsieur . Thank you . But I hope I shall be able to earn my own living . That is all I want .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . I wish you every success . Good-bye , Mademoiselle .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Good-bye , Monsieur . [ He goes out . She crosses to another door and brings in Madame Nérisse ] How good of you to come , dear Madame . Too bad you should have the trouble .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Nonsense , my dear . I wanted to come . I 'm so anxious to show you these two photographs and consult you about which we 're to publish . I expected to find you very tired .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I am not the least tired , and I 'm delighted to see you . MADAME NÉRISSE [ showing Thérèse the photographs ] This is more brilliant , that 's more dreamy . I like this one . What do you think ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I like this one too .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Then that 's settled . [ Putting down the photographs ] What a success you had this evening .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes ; people are very kind . [ Seriously ] I 'm so glad you 've come just now , dear Madame , so that we can have a few minutes ’ quiet talk . I have something most important to say to you .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Anything I can do for you ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Well , I 'll explain . And please do talk to me quite openly and frankly .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . I will indeed .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . You told me that my article was very much liked . I can quite believe that you may have exaggerated a little out of kindness to me . I want to know really whether you think I write well .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Dear Thérèse , ask Madame Guéret to tell you what I said to her just now about that very thing .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Then you think my collaboration might be really useful to Feminine Art ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . There 's nothing more useful to a paper like ours than the collaboration of girls in society .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Would you like me to send you some more stories like the first ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . As many as you can .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . And — [ She hesitates a moment ] and would you pay me the same price for them as for the one you 've just published ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Yes , exactly the same ; and I shall be very glad to get them . I like your work ; you have an exceptionally light touch ; people wo n't get tired of reading your stuff .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Oh , I hope that 's true ! I 'm going to tell you some bad news . For family reasons my godfather and godmother are going to leave Paris . I shall stay here by myself , and I shall have to live by my pen .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . What an idea !</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . It 's not an idea , it 's a necessity .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . What do you mean ? A necessity ? Monsieur Guéret —. But I must n't be inquisitive .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . You 're not inquisitive , and I 'll tell you all about it very soon ; we have n't got time now . Can you promise to take a weekly article from me ? MADAME NÉRISSE [ with less confidence ] Certainly . THÉRÈSE [ joyfully ] You can ! Oh , thank you , thank you ! I can n't tell you how you 've relieved my mind .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . My dear child . I am glad you 've spoken to me plainly . I will do everything I possibly can . I 'm extremely fond of you . I do n't think the Directors will object .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Why should they have anything to do with it ? MADAME NÉRISSE [ doubtfully ] Perhaps not , but — the Directors like to give each number a character of its own . It 's a thing they 're very particular about .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I could write about very different subjects .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . I know you could , but it would be always the same signature .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Well , every now and then I might sign a fancy name .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . That would be quite easy , and I do n't think the Directors would mind . They might say it was a fresh name to make itself known and liked .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . We 'll try and manage it .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . We shall have to fight against some jealousy . The Directors have protégées . The wife of one of them has been waiting to get an innings for more than two months . There are so many girls and women who write nowadays .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes ; but generally speaking their work is not worth much , I think .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Oh , I do n't know that . There are a great many who have real talent . People do n't realize what a lot of girls there are who have talent . But , still , if I 'm not able to take an article every week , you may rely upon me to take one as often as I possibly can . Oh , I shall make myself some enemies for your sake . THÉRÈSE [ in consternation ] Enemies ? How do you mean enemies ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . My dear , it alters everything if you become a professional . Let me see if I can explain . We have our regular contributors . The editor makes them understand that they must expect to run the gantlet of the occasional competition of society women ; because , if these women are allowed to write , it interests them and their families in the paper , and it 's an excellent advertisement for us . That 'll explain to you , by the way , why we sometimes publish articles not quite up to our standard . But if it 's a matter of regular , professional work , we have to be more careful . We have to respect established rights and consider people who 've been with us a long time . There is only a limited space in each number , and a lot of people have to live out of that . THÉRÈSE [ who has gone quite white ] Yes , I see . MADAME NÉRISSE [ who sees Thérèse 's emotion ] How sorry I am for you ! If you only knew how I feel for you ! Do n't look so unhappy . [ Thérèse makes a gesture of despair ] You 're not an ordinary girl , Thérèse , and it shall never be said that I did n't do all I could for you . Listen . I told you just now that I had some big projects in my mind . You shall know what they are . My husband and I are going to start an important weekly feminist paper on absolutely new lines . It 's going to leave everything that 's been done up to now miles behind . My husband shall explain his ideas to you himself . It 'll be advanced and superior and all that , and at the same time most practical . Even to think of it has been a touch of genius . When you meet my husband you 'll find that he 's altogether out of the common . He 's so clever , and he 'd be in the very first rank in journalism if it was n't for the envy and jealousy of other men who 've intrigued against him and kept him down . I do n't believe he has his equal in Paris as a journalist , I 'll read you some of his verses , and you 'll see that he 's a great poet too . But I shall run on forever . Only yesterday he got the last of the capital that 's needed for founding the paper ; it 's been definitely promised . We 're ready to set about collecting our staff . We shall have leading articles , of course , and literary articles . Do you want me to talk to him about you ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Of course I do . But —</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . We want to start a really smart , respectable woman 's paper ; of course without sacrificing our principles . Our title by itself proves that . It 's to be called Woman Free .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I 'll give you my answer to-morrow — or this evening , if you like . MADAME NÉRISSE [ hesitatingly ] Before I go — as we 're to be thrown a good deal together — I must tell you something about myself — a secret . I hope you wo n't care for me less when you know it . I call myself Madame Nérisse . But I have no legal right to the name . That 's why I 've always found some reason for not introducing Monsieur Nérisse to you and your people . He 's married — married to a woman who 's not worthy of him . She lives in an out-of-the-way place in the country and will not consent to a divorce . My dear Thérèse , it makes me very unhappy . I live only for him . I do n't think a woman can be fonder of a man than I am of him . He 's so superior to other men . But unfortunately I met him too late . I felt I ought to tell you this .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Your telling me has added to my friendship for you . I can guess how unhappy you are . Probably I 'll go this very evening to your house and see your husband and hear from him if he thinks I can be of use . Anyway , thank you very much .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . And thank you for the way you take this . Good-bye for the present . She goes out . Thérèse stands thinking for a moment , then René comes in . He is very much upset .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . René !</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Thérèse , it can n't be true ! It 's not possible ! It 's not all over — our love ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . We must be brave .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . But I can n't give you up .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I 've lost every penny , René dear .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . But I do n't love you any the less for that . I can n't give you up , Thérèse . I can n't give you up . I love you , I love you .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Oh , René , do n't ! I need all my courage to face this . Help me . Do n't you see , your people will never consent now .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . My uncle told me so . But I 'll see them . I 'll persuade them . I 'll explain to them .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . You know very well they never really liked me , and that they 'll be glad of this opportunity of breaking it off .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . I do n't know what to do . But I cannot give you up . What would become of me without you ? You 're everything to me , everything . And suddenly — because of this dreadful thing — I must give up my whole life 's happiness .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Your people are quite right , René .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . And you , you say that ! He hides his face in his hands . A silence . THÉRÈSE [ gently removing his hands ] Look at me , René . You 're crying . Oh , my dear love ! RENÉ [ taking her in his arms ] I love you , I love you !</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . And I love you . Oh , please do n't cry any more ! [ She kisses him ] René , dear , do n't cry any more ! You break my heart . I can n't bear it , I 'm forgetting all I ought to say to you . [ Breaking down ] Oh , how dreadful this is ! [ They cry together . Then she draws herself away from him , saying ] This is madness .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Ah , stay , Thérèse .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . No . We must n't do this ; we must be brave . Oh , why did you come here ? I was going to write to you . We 're quite helpless against this dreadful misfortune .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . I do n't know what to do ! But I can n't give you up . THÉRÈSE [ to herself ] I must do the right thing . [ To him ] René , stop crying . Listen to me .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . I love you .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes ; there 's our love . But besides that there 's life , and life is cruel and too strong for our love . There is your future , my dearest .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . My future is to love you . My future is nothing if I lose you . [ He buries his face in his hands</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . You can n't marry a girl without any money . That 's a dreadful fact , like a stone wall . We shall only break ourselves to pieces if we dash ourselves against it . Listen , oh , please listen to me . Do n't you hear what I 'm saying ? René — dear .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . I 'm listening .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I give you your freedom without any bitterness or hardness .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . I do n't want it !</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Now listen . You must n't sacrifice your whole life for a love affair , no matter how great the love is .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . It 's by losing you I shall sacrifice my life .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Try and be brave ; control yourself . Let us face this quietly . Suppose we do without your people 's consent . What will become of us ? Try to look the thing in the face . How should we live ? René , it 's horrible to bring our love down to the level of these miserable realities , but facts are facts . You know very well that if you marry me without your father and mother 's consent , they wo n't give you any money . Is n't that so ?</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Oh ! father is hard .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . He 's quite right , my dear , quite right . If I was your sister , I should advise you not to give up the position you have been brought up in and the profession you 've been educated for .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . But I love you . THÉRÈSE [ moved ] And I love you . Well , we 've got to forget one another .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . That 's impossible .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . We must be wise enough to — [ She stops , her voice breaks</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Oh ! how unhappy I am . THÉRÈSE [ controlling herself ] Do n't let yourself go . We 're not in dreamland . If you keep on saying “ I am unhappy , ” you 'll be unhappy .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . I love you so . Oh , Thérèse , how I love you ! THÉRÈSE [ softly ] You 'll forget me .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Never .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes . You 'll remember me in a way , of course . But you 're young . Very soon you 'll be able to live , to laugh , to love , to work .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . My dearest ! I do n't know what to say . I can n't talk of it . I only know one thing — I can n't let you go .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . But we should be miserable , René .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Miserable together !</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Think , dear , think . It will be years before you can earn your own living , wo n't it ?</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . But I —</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Now you know you 've tried already . Only last year you wanted to leave home and be independent , and you had to go back because you were starving . Is n't that true ?</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . It 's dreadful , dreadful ! [ He is overcome , terrified</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . So we must look at life as it is , practically , must n't we ? We have to have lodging and furniture and clothes . How are we to manage ?</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . It 's dreadful !</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . How would you bear to see me going about in rags ? [ He is silent . She waits , looking at him , hoping for a word of strength or courage . It does not come . She draws herself up slowly , her face hardening ] You can n't face that , can you ? Tell me . Can you face that ?</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . No . THÉRÈSE [ humiliated by his want of courage and infected by his weakness ] So you see , I 'm right . RENÉ [ sobbing ] Oh ! Oh ! THÉRÈSE [ setting her teeth ] Oh , can you do nothing but cry ?</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . What a useless creature I am .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . There , now , you see you 're better !</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . I 'm ashamed of being so good-for-nothing . THÉRÈSE [ hopeless ] You 're just like all the others . Now , do n't be miserable . I 'm not angry with you ; you are doing what I told you we must do , and you agree . Go , René . Say good-bye . Good-bye , René .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Thérèse ! THÉRÈSE [ her nerves on edge ] Everything we can say is useless , and it 'll only torture and humiliate us . We must end this — now — at once .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . I shall always love you , Thérèse .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes — exactly — now go .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Oh , my God !</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Go .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . I 'll go and see my people . They 'll never be so cruel —</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes , yes , all right .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . I 'll write you .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes — that 's it — you 'll write .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . I shall see you again , Thérèse ? [ He goes slowly to the door ] THÉRÈSE [ ashamed for him , covers her face with her hands . Then , all of a sudden , she bursts out into passionate sobs , having lost all control of herself , and cries wildly ] René ! RENÉ [ returning , shocked ] Thérèse ! Oh , what is it ? THÉRÈSE [ completely at the mercy of her feelings ] Suppose — suppose after all , we did it ? Listen . I love you far more than you know , more than I have ever let you know . A foolish feeling of self-respect made me hide a lot from you . Trust me . Trust your future to me . Marry me all the same . Believe in me . Marry me . You do n't know how strong I am and all the things I can do . I will work , and you will work . You did n't get on when you were alone , but you will when you have me with you . I 'll keep you brave when things go badly , and I 'll be happy with you when they go right . René , I 'll be content with so little ! The simplest , humblest , hardest life , until we 've made our way together — together , René , and conquered a place in the world for ourselves , that we 'll owe to no one but ourselves . Let us have courage — [ At this point she looks at him , and having looked she ceases to speak</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Thérèse , I 'm sure my people will give in . THÉRÈSE [ after a very long silence , inarticulately ] Go , go ; poor René . Forget what I said . Good-bye .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Oh , no ! not good-bye . I 'll make my father help us . THÉRÈSE [ sharply ] Too late , my friend , I do n't want you now . She leaves the room . René sinks into a chair and covers his face with his hands .</stage>

      <stage type="setting">
       <stage>SCENE :— A sitting-room at the offices of “ Woman Free . ” The door at the back opens into an entrance hall . The general editorial office is to the right , Monsieur Nérisse 's room to the left . At the back , also to the left , is another door opening into a smaller sitting-room . There are papers and periodicals upon the tables .</stage>
       <stage>The curtain rises upon Monsieur Mafflu . He is a man of about fifty , dressed for ease rather than elegance , and a little vulgar . He turns over the papers on the tables , studies himself in the mirror , and readjusts his tie . Madame Nérisse then comes in . She has Monsieur Mafflu 's visiting card in her hand . They bow to each other .</stage>

        <l>My card will have informed you that I am Monsieur</l>
        <l>Mafflu .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Yes . Wo n't you sit down ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MONSIEUR MAFFLU</speaker>
       <p>I am your new landlord , Madame . I have just bought this house . I 've retired from business . I was afraid I should n't have enough to do , so I 've bought some houses . I am my own agent . It gives me something to do . If a tenant wants repairs done , I go and see him . I love a bit of a gossip ; it passes away an hour or so . In that way I make people 's acquaintance — nice people . I did n't buy any of the houses where poor people live , though they 're better business . I should never have had the heart to turn out the ones that did n't pay , and I should have been obliged to start an agent , and all my plan would have been upset .<stage>A pause</stage>Now , Madame , for what brought me here . I hope you 'll forgive me for the trouble I 'm giving you — and I 'm sorry — but I 've come to give you notice .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Indeed ! May I ask what your reason is ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MONSIEUR MAFFLU</speaker>
       <p>I am just on the point of letting the second floor . My future tenant has young daughters .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . I 'm afraid I do n't see what that has got to do with it .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MONSIEUR MAFFLU</speaker>
       <p>Well — he 'll live only in a house in which all the tenants are private families .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . But we make no noise . We are not in any way objectionable .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MONSIEUR MAFFLU</speaker>
       <p>Oh , no , no ; not at all .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Well , then ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MONSIEUR MAFFLU</speaker>
       <p>How shall I explain ? I 'm certain you 're perfectly all right , and all the ladies who are with you here too , but I 've had to give in that house property is depreciated by people that work ; all the more if the people are ladies , and most of all if they 're ladies who write books or bring out a newspaper with such a name as Woman Free . People who know nothing about it think from such a name — oh , bless you , I understand all that 's rubbish , but — well — the letting value of the house , you see .<stage>He laughs</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . The sight of women who work for their living offends these people , does it ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MONSIEUR MAFFLU</speaker>
       <p>Yes , that 's the idea . A woman who works is always a little — hum — well — you know what I mean . Of course I mean nothing to annoy you .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . You mean that your future tenants do n't want their young ladies to have our example before them .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MONSIEUR MAFFLU</speaker>
       <p>No ! That 's just what they do n't . Having independent sort of people like you about makes ‘ em uneasy . For me , you know , I would n't bother about it — only — of course you do n't see it this way , but you 're odd — off the common somehow . You make one feel queer .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . But there are plenty of women who work .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MONSIEUR MAFFLU</speaker>
       <p>Oh , common women , yes ; oh , that 's all right .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . If you have children , they have nurses and governesses .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MONSIEUR MAFFLU</speaker>
       <p>Oh , those . They work , of course . They work for me , that 's quite different . But you — What bothers these ladies , Madame Mafflu and all the others , is that you 're in our own class . As for me I stick to the old saying , “ Woman 's place is the home . ”</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . But there are women who have got no home .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MONSIEUR MAFFLU</speaker>
       <p>That 's their own fault .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Very often it 's not at all their own fault . Where are they to go ? Into the streets ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MONSIEUR MAFFLU</speaker>
       <p>I know , I know . There 's all that . Still women can work without being feminists .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Have you any idea what you mean by “ feminist ” ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MONSIEUR MAFFLU</speaker>
       <p>Not very clear . I know the people I live among do n't know everything . I grant you all that . But Woman Free ! Woman Free ! Madame Mafflu wants to know what liberty — or what liberties — singular or plural ; do you take me ?— ha ! ha ! There might be questions asked . MADAME NÉRISSE<stage>laughing</stage>You must do me the honor of introducing me to Madame Mafflu . She must be an interesting woman . I 'll go and see her .</p>
      </sp>

       <p>Oh , do ! But not on a Wednesday .</p>

       <p>I should like her to see for herself how nice you are . Her friends have been talking to her . They thought that you — well — they say feminist women are like the women were in the time of the Commune . They said perhaps you 'd even go on a deputation !</p>

       <p>Oh , talkin ’ of that , one of my friends has an argument nobody can answer . “ Let these women , ” he says , “ let ‘ em do their military service . ”</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Well , you tell him that if men make wars , women make soldiers ; and get killed at that work too , sometimes . MONSIEUR MAFFLU [ after reflecting for some moments ] I 'll tell him , but he wo n't understand .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Well , no matter . I wo n't detain you any longer , Monsieur Mafflu .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MONSIEUR MAFFLU</speaker>
       <p>Oh ! Madame . I should like to stay and talk to you for hours . MADAME NÉRISSE<stage>laughing</stage>You 're too kind .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MONSIEUR MAFFLU</speaker>
       <p>Then you forgive me ? MADAME NÉRISSE<stage>going to the door with him</stage>What would one not forgive you ? MONSIEUR MAFFLU<stage>turning back</stage>I say —</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . No , no . Good-bye , Monsieur .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MONSIEUR MAFFLU</speaker>
       <p>Good-bye , Madame . He goes out . MADAME NÉRISSE<stage>to herself</stage>One really could n't be angry ! Thérèse comes in with a little moleskin bag on her arm . She is in a light dress , is very gay , and looks younger .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Good-morning , Madame . I 'm so sorry to be late . I met Monsieur Féliat , my godmother 's brother .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . How is Madame Guéret ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Very well , he says .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . And does Monsieur Guéret like his new home ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes , very much .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . And Madame Guéret ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . She seems to be quite happy .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . What a good thing . Here 's the letter Monsieur Nérisse has written for you to that editor . [ She hands her an unsealed letter</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Oh , thank you !</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Did you find out when he could see you ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . To-morrow at Two O'clock . Can you spare me then ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Yes , certainly .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Thank you .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Why do n't you read your letter ? You see it 's open .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I 'll shut it up .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Read it .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Shall I ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Yes , do . THÉRÈSE [ reading ] Oh , it 's too much . This is too kind . With a letter like this my article is certain to be read . Monsieur Nérisse is kind ! Will you tell him how very grateful I am ? MADAME NÉRISSE [ coldly ] Yes . [ She makes an effort to be kind ] I 'll tell him , of course . But I dictated the letter myself . Monsieur Nérisse only signed it . [ She rings</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Then I have one more kindness to thank you for . MADAME NÉRISSE [ to the page boy ] I expect Monsieur Cazarès .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOY</speaker>
       <p>Monsieur —?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Our old editor — Monsieur Cazarès . You know him very well .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOY</speaker>
       <p>Oh , yes , Madame , yes !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . He will have another gentleman with him . You must show them straight into Monsieur Nérisse 's room and let me know .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOY</speaker>
       <p>Yes , Madame . During this conversation Thérèse has taken off her hat and put it into a cupboard . She has opened a green cardboard box and put her gloves and veil into it — folding the latter carefully — also Monsieur Nérisse 's letter . She has taken out a little mirror , given some touches to her hair , and has put it back . Finally she closes the box .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Monsieur Cazarès is bringing us a new backer . We 're going to make changes in the paper . I 'll tell you all about it presently . [ With a change of tone ] Tell me , what was there between you and Monsieur Cazarès ? THÉRÈSE [ simply ] Nothing at all .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Is n't he just a wee bit in love with you ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I have n't the least idea . He 's said nothing to me about it , if he is .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . He 's always behaved quite nicely to you ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Always .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . And Monsieur Nérisse ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Monsieur Nérisse ? I do n't understand .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Oh , yes , you do . Has he ever made love to you ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . [ hurt ] Oh , Madame !</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . [ looking closely at her and then taking both her hands affectionately ] Forgive me , dear child . I know how good and straight you are . You must n't mind the things I say . Sometimes I 'm horrid I know . I have an idea that Monsieur Nérisse is not as fond of me as he used to be .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Oh , indeed that 's only your fancy .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . I hope so . I 'm a bit nervous I think . I 've such a lot of trouble with the paper just now . It 's not going well . [ Gesture of Thérèse ] We 're going to try something fresh . This time I think it 'll be all right . You 'll see it will . [ A pause ] What 's that ? Did he call ? I 'm sure that idiot of a boy has n't made up his fire , and he 'd never think of it . He 's like a great baby . [ As she goes towards Monsieur Nérisse 's door — the door on the left — the door on the right opens , and Mademoiselle Grégoire comes in . She has taken off her hat . Madame Nérisse turns to her ] Why , it 's Mademoiselle Grégoire ! You know , Dr. Grégoire ! [ To Mademoiselle Grégoire ] This is Mademoiselle Thérèse . [ They shake hands ] I spoke to you about her . She 'll explain everything to you in no time . I 'll come back very soon and introduce you to the others . Excuse me for a minute . [ She goes out to the left</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . [ pleasantly ] I really do n't know what Madame Nérisse wants me to explain to you . You know our paper ?</stage>
      <stage>MADEMOISELLE GRÉGOIRE . No , I 've never seen it .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Never seen it ! Never seen Woman Free ?</stage>
      <stage>MADEMOISELLE GRÉGOIRE . Never . I only know it by name .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . How odd ! Well , here 's a copy . It 's in two parts , you see , and they 're quite different from each other . Here the doctrine , there the attractions . Madame Nérisse thought of that . MADEMOISELLE GRÉGOIRE [ reading as she turns over the leaves ] “ Votes for Women . ” THÉRÈSE [ reading with her ] “ Votes for Women , ” “ An End of Slavery . ” And then , on here , lighter things .</stage>
      <stage>MADEMOISELLE GRÉGOIRE . Frivolities ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Frivolities . A story . “ Beauty Notes . ” MADEMOISELLE GRÉGOIRE [ reading and laughing a little ] “ The Doctor 's Page . ”</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Oh , too bad ! But it was n't I who first said frivolities ! MADEMOISELLE GRÉGOIRE [ still laughing ] I shall bear up . And what comes after “ The Doctor 's Page ” ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . “ Beauty Notes ” and “ Gleanings . ”</stage>
      <stage>MADEMOISELLE GRÉGOIRE . Gleanings ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes . It 's a column where real and imaginary subscribers exchange notes about cookery receipts , and housekeeping tips , and hair lotions , and that sort of thing .</stage>
      <stage>MADEMOISELLE GRÉGOIRE . Quite a good thing .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I most confess it 's the best read part .</stage>
      <stage>MADEMOISELLE GRÉGOIRE . I 'm not at all surprised .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I 'm afraid we can n't conceal from ourselves that Monsieur Nérisse has not altogether succeeded . Each of us is inclined to like only her own section . We 've a girl here , Caroline Legrand , one of the staff , who 's tremendously go-a-head . You should hear her on the subject of “ Soap of the Sylphs ” and “ Oriental Balm . ”</stage>
      <stage>MADEMOISELLE GRÉGOIRE . It makes her furious ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . She 's a sort of rampageous saint ; ferocious and affectionate by turns , a bit ridiculous perhaps , but delightful and generous . She 's so simple nasty people could easily make a fool of her , but all nice people like her .</stage>
      <stage>MADEMOISELLE GRÉGOIRE . Shall I have much to do with her ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Not much . You 'll be under Mademoiselle de Meuriot , and you 'll be lucky . She 's a dear . She 's been sacrificing herself all her life . She 's my great friend — the only one I have . MADEMOISELLE GRÉGOIRE [ taking up the paper again ] But how 's this ? Your contributors are all men . Gabriel de —, Camille de —, Claud de —, René de —, Marcel de —.</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Well ! I never noticed that before . They 're the pen-names of our writers .</stage>
      <stage>MADEMOISELLE GRÉGOIRE . All men 's names ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes . People still think more of men as writers . You see they are names that might be either a man 's or a woman 's . Camille , René , Gabriel .</stage>
      <stage>MADEMOISELLE GRÉGOIRE . There 's only one woman 's name — Vicomtesse de Renneville .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . That 's snobbery ! It 's Madame Nérisse 's pen-name .</stage>
      <stage>MADEMOISELLE GRÉGOIRE . Well , I suppose it 's good business . Mademoiselle de Meuriot comes in at the back , bringing a packet of letters .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>The post 's come , Thérèse .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . This is Mademoiselle de Meuriot . [ Introducing Mademoiselle Grégoire ] Our new contributor .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>You 're welcome , Mademoiselle . The door on the left opens and Madame Nérisse appears backwards , still talking to Monsieur Nérisse , who is invisible in the inner room .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Yes , dearest . Yes , dearest . Yes , dearest . Mademoiselle Grégoire looks up at Madame Nérisse . Mademoiselle de Meuriot and Thérèse turn away their heads to hide their smiles ; finally Madame Nérisse shuts the door , not having noticed anything , and comes forward . She speaks to Mademoiselle Grégoire .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Come , my dear . I 'll introduce you to the others . [ To Mademoiselle de Meuriot ] Ah ! the post has come . Open the letters , Thérèse , will you ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>Yes , we will . MADAME NÉRISSE<stage>at the door on the right , to Mademoiselle Grégoire</stage>You first .<stage>They go out</stage>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT<stage>smiling</stage>I think our new friend was a bit amused . She 's pretty .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes , and she looks capable .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>Let 's get to work . She sits down , at a desk . Thérèse sits near her at the end of the same desk . During all that follows Thérèse opens envelopes with a letter opener and passes them to Mademoiselle de Meuriot , who takes the letters out , glances at them , and makes three or four little piles of them .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Here ! [ Holding out the first letter ] MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT [ as she works ] And you ? How are you this morning ? [ Looking closely at her and shaking a finger ] You 're tired , little girl . You sat up working last night .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I wanted to finish copying out my manuscript . It took me ages , because I wanted to make it as clear as print . MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT [ gravely ] You know you must n't be ill , Thérèse .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . How good you are , Mademoiselle , and how lucky I am to have you for a friend . What should I do without you ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>How about your godmother ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I did n't get on with her . She never could hide her dislike for me , and it burst out in the end . When she saw that in spite of everything she could say I was going to leave her , she let herself go and made a dreadful scene . And , what was worse , my good , kind godfather joined in ! It seemed as if they thought my wanting to be independent was a direct insult to them . What a lot of letters there are to-day .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>It 's the renewal of the subscriptions .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Oh , is that it ? So you see we parted , not exactly enemies — but , well — on our dignity . We write little letters to one another now , half cold and half affectionate . I tell you , without you I should be quite alone .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>Not more alone than I am .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I have someone to talk to now and tell my little worries to . It 's not that , even . One always finds people ready to listen to you and pity you , but what one does n't find is people one can tell one 's most impossible dreams to and feel sure one wo n't be laughed at . That 's real friendship . [ She stops working as she continues ] To dare to think out loud before another person and let her see the gods of one 's secret idolatry , and to be sure one 's not exposing one 's precious things to blasphemy . How I love you for being like you are and for caring for me a little . [ She resumes her work</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>I do n't care for you a little , Thérèse ! I care for you very much indeed . I like you because you 're brave and hurl yourself against obstacles like a little battering ram , and because you 're straight and honest and one can depend on you . THÉRÈSE<stage>who can n't get open the letter she holds</stage>Please pass me the scissors . Thanks .<stage>She cuts open the envelope</stage>I might have been all those things , and it would have been no good at all , if you had n't been able to see them .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>Remember that in being friends with you I get as much as I give . My people were very religious and very proud of their title . I made up my mind to leave home , but since then I 've been quite alone — alone for thirty years . I 'm selfish in my love for you now . I 've had so little of that sort of happiness .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . You 've done so much for women . You 've helped so many . MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT [ touching her piles of letters ] Here 's another who wo n't renew .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . What will Madame Nérisse say ? [ Continuing ] You know , Mademoiselle , it 's not only success that I want . I have a great ambition . I should like to think that because I 've lived there might be a little less suffering in the world . That 's the sort of thing that I can say to nobody but you . MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT [ tenderly ] Thérèse has an ardent soul .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes , Thérèse has an ardent soul . It was you who said that about me first , and I think I deserve it . [ Changing her tone ] Here 's the subscriber 's book . [ She hands the book and continues in her former voice ] Like Guyan , I have more tears than I need to spend on my own sufferings , so I can give the spare ones to other people . And not only tears , but courage and consolation that I have no opportunity of using up myself . Do you understand what I mean ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>Yes , I understand , my dear . I see my own youth over again .<stage>Sadly</stage>Oh , I hope that you — but I do n't want to rouse up those old ghosts ; I should only distress you . Perhaps lives like mine are necessary , if it 's only to throw into relief lives that are more beautiful than mine . Keep your lovely dreams .<stage>A silence</stage>When I think that instead of being an old maid I might have been the mother of a girl like you ! THÉRÈSE<stage>leaning towards her and kissing her hair</stage>Do n't cry . MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT<stage>tears in her eyes and a smile upon her lips</stage>No , no , I wo n't ; and when I think that somewhere or other there 's a man you love ! THÉRÈSE<stage>smiling</stage>Some day or other I must tell you a whole lot of things about René .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>Have you seen him again ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>But you were supposed not to meet any more . THÉRÈSE<stage>with a mutinous little smile</stage>Yes , we were supposed not to meet any more . One says those things and then one meets all the same . If René had gone on being the feeble and lamentable young man that I parted from the Barberine evening , I should perhaps have never seen him again . You do n't know what my René has done , do you now ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>No .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I 've been looking forward so to telling you . [ Eagerly ] Well , he 's quite changed . He 's become a different man . Oh , he 's not a marvel of energy even yet , but he 's not the helpless youth who was still feeding out of his father 's hands at twenty-five .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>And how has this great improvement come about ? THÉRÈSE<stage>looking at her knowingly</stage>You 'll make me blush .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>Was it for love of you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I think it was for love of me . Let me tell you . He wanted to see me again , and he waited at the door when I was coming out from my work , just as if I was a little milliner 's assistant . And then he came back another evening , and then another . While we were walking from here to my place we chattered , and chattered , and chattered . We had more to say to each other than we 'd ever had before , and I began to realize that his want of will and energy was more the result of always hanging on to his people than anything else . Then there came a crash . [ She laughs ] A most fortunate crash . His father formally ordered him not to see me again ; threatened , if he did , to stop his allowance . What do you think my René did ? He sent back the cheque his people had just given him with quite a nice , civil , respectful letter . Then he left his office and got a place in a business house at an absurdly small salary , and he 's been working there ever since . [ Laughing ] He shocked all the other young men in the office by the way he stuck to it . He got gradually interested in what he had to do . He read it all up ; the heads of the firm noticed him and were civil to him , and now they 've sent him on important business to Tunis . And that 's what he 's done all for love of me ! Now , do n't you think I ought to care for him a little ? Do n't you ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>Yes , my dear . But then if he 's in Tunis ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Oh , he 'll come back .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>And when will the wedding be ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . He 's sure his people will give in in the end if he can make some money . We shall wait . The page boy comes in with seven or eight round parcels in his arms .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOY</speaker>
       <p>Here are this morning 's manuscripts .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>Put them with the others .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOY</speaker>
       <p>There was one lady was quite determined to see you herself . She said her article was most particular . It 's among that lot .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>Very well .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOY</speaker>
       <p>Mademoiselle Caroline Legrand is coming . He opens the door and stands back to allow Caroline Legrand to come in . She is dressed in a long brown tailor-made overcoat and a white waistcoat , with a yellow necktie .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CAROLINE LEGRAND</speaker>
       <p>Good-morning , Meuriot .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>Good-morning , Caroline Legrand .<stage>They shake hands</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CAROLINE LEGRAND</speaker>
       <p>It seems there 's something new going on here .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>I believe there is , but I know nothing about it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CAROLINE LEGRAND</speaker>
       <p>I expect the paper 's not going well , the jam has n't hidden the pill . Even Madame Nérisse 's thirtieth article upon divorce at the desire of one party has n't succeeded in stirring up enthusiasm this time . She 's been preaching up free love , but she really started the paper only because she thought it would help her to get the law changed and allow her to marry her “ dearest . ”</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Mademoiselle Legrand , I have some news that will please you .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CAROLINE LEGRAND</speaker>
       <p>Are all the men dead ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . No , not yet ; but I 've heard that in a small country town they 're starting a Woman 's Trade Union .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CAROLINE LEGRAND</speaker>
       <p>It wo n't succeed . Women are too stupid .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . They 've opened a special workshop there , and they 're going to have work that 's always been done by men done by women .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CAROLINE LEGRAND</speaker>
       <p>That 's splendid ! A woman worker the more is a slave the less . MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT<stage>gravely</stage>Are you quite sure of that ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CAROLINE LEGRAND</speaker>
       <p>Oh , do n't you misunderstand me !<stage>Forcibly</stage>Listen to this . A time will come when people will be as ashamed of having made women work as they are ashamed now of having kept slaves . But , until then —</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . The employer is rather disturbed about it .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CAROLINE LEGRAND</speaker>
       <p>He 's quite right . Very soon there 'll be a fierce reaction among the men about this cheap women 's labor . There 's going to be a new sex struggle — the struggle for bread . Man will use all his strength and all his cruelty to defend himself . There 's a time coming when gallantry and chivalry will go by the board , I can tell you . Madame Nérisse comes in .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Oh , good-morning , Legrand . I 'm glad you 're here , I 've been wanting to ask your advice about a new idea I want to start in Woman Free . A correspondence about getting up a league of society women —</stage>

       <p>What about the others ? MADAME NÉRISSE<stage>continuing , without attending to her</stage>— and smart people , who will undertake not to wear ornaments in their hats made of the wings or the plumage of birds .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CAROLINE LEGRAND</speaker>
       <p>You 're giving up Woman Free for Birds Free , then ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . What do you mean ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CAROLINE LEGRAND</speaker>
       <p>You 'd better make a league to do away with hats altogether as a protest against the sweating of the women who stitch the straw at famine prices and make the ribbon at next to nothing . I shall be more concerned for the fate of the sparrows when I have n't got to concern myself about the fate of sweated women .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Well , of course . That 's the article we 've got to write .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CAROLINE LEGRAND</speaker>
       <p>Of course .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . We 'll write it in the form of a letter to a member of parliament — it had better be a man , because we 're going to put him in the wrong — a member of parliament who wants to form the league I suggested . What you said about the sparrows will be a splendid tag at the end . Will you write it ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CAROLINE LEGRAND</speaker>
       <p>Rather ! It 's lucky you do n't stick to your ideas very obstinately , because they can sometimes be improved upon . I think I shall write your paper for you in future .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Go along and send me in Mademoiselle Grégoire and Madame Chanteuil . They 'll bother you , and I want them here .</stage>

      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . She 's a little mad , but she really has good ideas sometimes . The page boy comes in . BOY [ to Madame Nérisse ] The gentlemen are there , Monsieur Cazarès and another gentleman .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Are they with Monsieur Nérisse ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOY</speaker>
       <p>Yes , Madame .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Very well , I 'll go . [ The boy goes out . She speaks to the others ] Divide the work between you . [ To Madame Chanteuil and Mademoiselle Grégoire , who come in from the right ] There 's lots of work to be done . [ She goes out to the left</stage>

       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>We 'd better sit down .<stage>She sits down and says what follows whilst they are taking their places round the table . She takes up the first letter</stage>This is for the advertising department . Is Mademoiselle Baron here ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . No , poor little thing . She 's trudging round Paris to try and get hold of a few advertisements .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADAME CHANTEUIL</speaker>
       <p>It 's a dreadful job , trying to get advertisements for a paper that three-quarters of the people she goes to have never heard of . It gives me the shivers to remember what I had to go through myself over that job .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . And poor little Baron is so shy !</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>She earned only fifty francs all last month .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADEMOISELLE GRÉGOIRE . I know her , I met her lately ; she told me she was in luck , that she had an appointment with the manager of the Institut de Jouvence .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADAME CHANTEUIL</speaker>
       <p>And she thinks she 's in luck !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADEMOISELLE GRÉGOIRE . It appears that that 's a place where you can do quite good business . MADAME CHANTEUIL [ gravely ] Yes , young women can do business there if they 're pretty ; but have you any idea what price they pay ? Nothing would induce me to put my foot inside the place again .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>Oh , the poor little girl ! Oh , dear !<stage>A pause . She begins to sort the letters</stage>THÉRÈSE<stage>half to herself</stage>It seems to me our name Woman Free is horrible irony . MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT<stage>holding a letter in her hand</stage>Oh , Chanteuil , what have you done ? Here 's somebody perfectly furious . She says she asked you to give her some information in the beauty column .<stage>Reading</stage>It was something she was mistaken about . She wrote under the name of “ Always Young , ” and apparently you 've answered “ Always Young is a mistake . ” She thinks you did it to insult her . You must write her a letter of apologies .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADAME CHANTEUIL</speaker>
       <p>Yes , Mademoiselle . MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT<stage>holding up another letter</stage>“ Little Questions of Sentiment . ” This is for you , Thérèse .<stage>She reads</stage>“ I feel so sad because I am getting old , ” etc . Answer , “ Why this sadness — ”</p>

       <speaker>MADAME CHANTEUIL</speaker>
       <p>I am . MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT<stage>passing her letters</stage>Here are two , three — one without a post office order . Put that one straight into the waste paper basket . Remember that you must always promise them luck , with little difficulties to give success more flavor . And be sure to tell them they 're full of good qualities , with some little amiable weaknesses and the sort of defects one enjoys boasting about .<stage>Going on reading</stage>“ About using whites of eggs to take the sharpness out of sorrel , ” “ To take out ink-stains . ” These are for you , dear .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADEMOISELLE GRÉGOIRE . Yes . [ She takes the letters ] I did n't think of that when I took my degree . MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT [ continuing ] “ Stoutness ” ; that 's for you too . [ Glancing again at the letter ] What does this one want ? [ Fluttering the leaves ] Four pages ; ah , here we are — “ A slender figure — smaller hips — am not too stout anywhere else . ” That 's for the doctor . [ She gives the letter to Mademoiselle Grégoire with several others</stage>

       <p>My dear , not at all , “ Soap of the Sylphs . ”</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADEMOISELLE GRÉGOIRE . But that 's exactly the same thing .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>I know that . But it sounds so different .<stage>Taking another letter</stage>“ A red nose ” —</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADEMOISELLE GRÉGOIRE . Lemon juice . MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT [ continuing ] “ Superfluous hairs . ” Be sure to recommend the cream that gives us advertisements ; do n't make any mistake about that . “ Black specks on the chin , ” “ Wrinkles round the eyes . ”</stage>
      <stage>MADEMOISELLE GRÉGOIRE . There 's no cure for that .</stage>

       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>That 's too easy , she would n't believe in it . Find something else .<stage>Continuing to read</stage>“ To make them firm without enlarging them ” ; that 's for you too . And all the rest I think . “ To whiten the teeth , ” “ To make the hair lighter , ” “ To give firmness to the bust . ”</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADAME CHANTEUIL</speaker>

No , here 's one that wants white arms . They 're all alike , poor women !</p>

       <p>Ah , here 's Mademoiselle Baron .<stage>To Mademoiselle Baron</stage>Well ? What luck ? MADEMOISELLE BARON<stage>miserably</stage>There 's no one in the office . I 've got the signed contract for the advertisements of the Institut de Jouvence . Now I must go on to the printers . Here it is . Good-bye .<stage>A silence</stage>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT<stage>in a suffocated voice</stage>Good-bye , my dear . They watch her go sadly . A long silence . THÉRÈSE<stage>speaking with great emotion</stage>Poor , poor little thing ! MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT<stage>also quite overcome , slowly</stage>Perhaps she has someone at home who 's hungry .

      </sp>
      <stage>MADEMOISELLE GRÉGOIRE . I must go and see to the “ Doctor 's Page . ”</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADAME CHANTEUIL</speaker>
       <p>And I to the “ Gleaner 's Column . ” They go out to the right . Thérèse rests her chin on her two hands and reflects profoundly . Monsieur Nérisse comes in at the back . NÉRISSE<stage>speaking back to the people he has left in his office in an irritated voice</stage>Do as you like . I 've told you my opinion . I wash my hands of it . When your draft is ready show it to me .<stage>He shuts the door . Thérèse , when she hears his voice , has gathered up her papers and is making for the door on the right . He calls her back</stage>Mademoiselle !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Monsieur !</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . Listen . I have something to say to you . [ Thérèse returns ] Did Madame Nérisse give you the letter of introduction I wrote for you ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes , Monsieur . Please forgive me for not having thanked you before .</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . It 's nothing .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Indeed it 's a great deal .</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . Nothing .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes , I 'm sure to be received quite differently with that letter from what I should be without it .</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . I can give you any number of letters like that . May I ? THÉRÈSE [ coldly ] No , thank you .</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . You wo n't let me ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . No .</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . Why ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . You know very well why .</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . You 're still angry with me . You do yourself harm by the way you treat me , you do indeed . Listen , this is the sort of thing . Moranville , the editor of the review I was talking about , is going to meet me at my restaurant after dinner . I know he wants just such stories as you write . But Moranville reads only the manuscripts of people he knows — he has a craze about it . Well , I hardly dare propose to you a thing which nevertheless is perfectly natural among colleagues , to come and dine with me first and meet him after . I hardly like — [ Thérèse draws herself up ] You see , I 'm right . You do n't trust me .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . On the contrary , I 'll go gladly . Madame Nérisse will be with you of course ? NÉRISSE [ annoyed ] Madame Nérisse ! Nonsense ! Do you suppose I drag her everywhere I go ? Say no more about it . Whatever I say will only make you suspicious . [ With a sigh ] All this misunderstanding and suspicion is horrible to me . How stupid the world is ! There are times when I feel disgusted with everything , myself included ! I 'm getting old . I 'm a failure . I 'm losing my time and wasting my life over this ridiculous paper , which will never be anything but an obscure rag . I shall have done for myself soon . THÉRÈSE [ awkwardly , for something to say ] Do n't say that .</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . Yes , I shall . I might have a chance of saving myself yet if I took things energetically and got free of the whole thing . But I should have to be quick about it . [ A silence . Thérèse does not know what to say and does not dare to leave the room ] I 'm so low — so unhappy !</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . So unhappy ?</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . Yes . [ Another silence . Madame Nérisse comes in and looks at them pointedly ] Are they gone ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Yes , they 're gone .</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . Is it all settled ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Yes . I am to meet them at the bank at four . But they would n't give way on the question of reducing expenses as regards the contributors .</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . And the dates of publication ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . We are to come out fortnightly instead of weekly . [ Indicating the door on the right ] You must go and speak to them .</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . Is Thérèse 's salary to be reduced too ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . It would be impossible to make distinctions .</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . Difficult , yes . Still — I think one might have managed to do something for her .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . I cannot see how she differs from the others . Can you ?</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . Oh , well — say no more about it .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . That will be best . [ He goes out to the right . To herself ] I should think so indeed ! [ To Thérèse ] While Monsieur Nérisse was talking to the other man I had a chat with Monsieur Cazarès . He was talking about you . He 's a nice fellow , and it 's quite a good family you know . He 's steady and fairly well off — very well off . THÉRÈSE [ laughing ] You talk as if you were offering me a husband !</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . And what would you say supposing he had asked me to sound you ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I should say that I was very much obliged , but that I decline the honor .</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . What 's wrong with him ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Nothing .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Well then ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . You can n't marry upon that .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Have you absolutely made up your mind ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Absolutely .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . I think you 're making a mistake . I think it all the more because this chance comes just at a time — well , you 'll understand what I mean when I 've told you something that I have to say to you as manageress of Woman Free . It 's this . You know that in spite of all we could do we 've had to hunt about for more capital . We 've found some , but we 've had to submit to very severe conditions . The most important is that they insist upon a stringent cutting down of expenses . Instead of coming out every week , Woman Free will be a fortnightly in future , and we 've been obliged to consent to reducing the salaries of the contributors in proportion .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . How much will they be reduced ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . In proportion I tell you . They 'll be cut down by one half .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . And I shall not have enough to live upon even in the simplest way .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . That was exactly what I said to them . And the work will not be the same .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . My work will not be the same ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . No ; you will be obliged to work at night .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . At night ?</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Yes .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . But then I shall be free all day .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . No , you wo n't . In the daytime you will have to take charge of the business part of the paper , and in the evening too your work will not be purely literary , but more of an administrative character .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . It appears to me that I 'm asked to accept a smaller salary and to do double work for it .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . I am conveying to you the offers of the new Directors ; if they do n't suit you , you have only to refuse them .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Of course I refuse them , and you may say to the people who have made them that they must be shameful sweaters to dare to offer women salaries that leave them no choice between starvation and degradation .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Those are strong words , my dear , and you seem to forget very quickly — THÉRÈSE [ softening ] Yes . Oh , I beg your pardon . But think for a minute , Madame , and you 'll forgive me for being angry . I hardly know what I 'm saying . [ Madame Nérisse half turns away ] Listen , oh listen ! Forget what I said just now ; I 'll explain to you . I accept the reduction of salary . I 'll manage . I 'll get my expenses down . Only I can n't consent to give up all my time . You know I have some work in hand ; you know I have a big undertaking to which I 've given all my life . I 've told you about it , you know about that . You know I can only stand my loneliness and everything because of the hope I have about this . If people take all my time , it 's the same as if they killed me . I beg you , I implore you , get them to leave me my evenings free .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . It can n't be done . THÉRÈSE [ pulling herself together ] Very well , that 's settled . I will go at the end of the month ; that 's to say to-morrow .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Take a little time to consider it .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I have considered it . They propose that I should commit suicide . I say no !</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . I 'm sorry , truly sorry . [ She rings . While she waits for the bell to be answered , she looks searchingly at Thérèse , who does not notice it . To the page boy who comes in ] Go and call me a taxi , but first say to Monsieur Nérisse —</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOY</speaker>
       <p>Monsieur Nérisse has just gone out , Madame .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Are you quite sure ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOY</speaker>
       <p>I called him a taxi .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Very well , you can go . [ To Thérèse ] I 'll ask you for your final answer this evening . [ She hands her two large books ] If you make up your mind to stay , make me these two bibliographies . Thérèse does not answer . Madame Nérisse goes out to the left . Left alone Thérèse begins to sort the papers on her bureau rather violently . She seizes a paper knife , flings it upon the couch , and afterwards walks up and down the room in great agitation . The door on the right opens and there come in such exclamations as No ! Never ! It 's monstrous ! I shall leave ! It 's an insult ! Caroline Legrand , Mademoiselle Grégoire , Madame Chanteuil , and Mademoiselle de Meuriot come in . Mademoiselle de Meuriot is the only one who has kept her self-possession . MADEMOISELLE GRÉGOIRE [ speaking above the din ] Good-bye , all . [ She goes to the small salon from which she originally came in , and during the conversation that follows comes in putting on her hat , and goes out unnoticed at the back</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Well , what do you think of this ? MADAME CHANTEUIL AND CAROLINE LEGRAND [ together ] It 's an insult .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>You must try and keep quiet .</l>

        <l>What shall you do ?</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I shall leave .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>You ought to stay .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADAME CHANTEUIL</speaker>
       <p>No , Thérèse is right . We must all leave .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . We must leave to-morrow — no , this evening . MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT [ quietly ] Do you think that you 'll be able to make better terms anywhere else ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . That wo n't be difficult .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>You think so ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Rather .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CAROLINE LEGRAND</speaker>
       <p>Where , for instance ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . There are other papers in Paris besides this one .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>Then you know a lot of others that pay better ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . One will be enough for me .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CAROLINE LEGRAND</speaker>
       <p>And you think you 'll find a place straight off ? You know there are other people —</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I 'll give lessons . I took my degree .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CAROLINE LEGRAND</speaker>
       <p>Much good may it do you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>You think you 'll be a governess ? At one time a governess could get 1 , 200 francs , now it 's 650 francs — less than the cook . And if you were to be a companion —</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Why not a lady 's maid at once ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CAROLINE LEGRAND</speaker>
       <p>Yes ; lady 's maid . That 's not a bad idea . It 's the only occupation a girl brought up as rich people bring up their daughters can be certain to get and to keep , if she 's only humble enough .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I shall manage to get along without taking to that .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>But , Thérèse , have you really been blind to all that 's been going on here ? Have n't you constantly seen unfortunate women , as well brought up and as well educated as yourself , coming hunting for work ? Do n't you remember that advertisement of the girl that Caroline Legrand was interested in ? That advertisement has been appearing in the paper for the last three months . I 'll read it to you .<stage>Caroline Legrand takes up a number of “ Women Free ” and passes it to Mademoiselle de Meuriot</stage>Here it is .<stage>Reading</stage>“ A young lady of distinguished appearance , who has taken a high certificate for teaching . Good musician . Drawing , English , shorthand , etc . ” I know that girl . She told me all about her life . D'you know what she 's offered ? She asked two francs an hour for teaching the piano . They laughed in her face , because for that they could get a girl who 'd taken first prize at the Conservatoire . They gave her seventy-five centimes . Deduct from that seventy-five centimes the price of the journey in that underground , the wear and tear of clothes , the time lost in going and coming , and then what do you think is left ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CAROLINE LEGRAND</speaker>
       <p>Let 's be just . She got answers from doubtful places abroad , letters from old satyrs , and invitations to pose for the “ movies . ”</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>What 's left then ? The stage . It 's quite natural you should think of the stage .</p>
      </sp>

       <speaker>CAROLINE LEGRAND</speaker>
       <p>If one must ! You 'd condescend to it , would n't you ? You poor child !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>You can n't get into the Conservatoire after twenty-one . Are you under that ? No . Are you a genius ? No . Well then ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CAROLINE LEGRAND</speaker>
       <p>Have you a rich lover who will back you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>No . Then you 'll get nothing at all in the theatres except by making friends with half a dozen men or selling yourself to one .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I 'll go into a shop . At any rate , when it shuts I shall be free .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CAROLINE LEGRAND</speaker>
       <p>You think they 're longing for you , do n't you ? You forget you 'd have to know things for that one does n't learn by taking a degree ; things like shorthand and typewriting . Do you know there are twenty thousand women in Paris who want to get into shops and offices and can n't find places ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADAME CHANTEUIL</speaker>
       <p>I know exactly what 's going to become of me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CAROLINE LEGRAND</speaker>
       <p>Now you 're going to say something silly .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADAME CHANTEUIL</speaker>
       <p>You think so , you 've guessed . Well , I tell you , middle class girls thrown on the world as we are can n't get along without a man — a husband or a lover . We have n't got the key of the prison door . We 've not learned a trade . We 've learned to smile , and dance , and sing — parlor tricks . All that 's only of use in a love affair or a marriage . Without a man we 're stranded . Our parents have brought us all up for one career and one only — the man . I was a fool not to understand before . Now I see .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CAROLINE LEGRAND</speaker>
       <p>Look here , you 're not going to take a lover ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADAME CHANTEUIL</speaker>
       <p>Suppose I am ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CAROLINE LEGRAND</speaker>
       <p>My dear , you came here full of indignation , clamoring against the state of society . You called yourself a feminist , but you , and women like you , are feminists only when it 's convenient . There are no real feminists except ugly women like me or old ones like Meuriot . You others come about us in a swarm and then drop away one after another to go off to some man . As soon as a lover condescends to throw the handkerchief you 're up and off to him . You want to be slaves . Go , my dear , and take your lover . That 's your fate . Good-night .<stage>She goes out</stage>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT<stage>to Madame Chanteuil</stage>Do n't listen to her , you poor child . Do n't ruin all your life in a fit of despair .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADAME CHANTEUIL</speaker>
       <p>I can n't stay here . I 'm not a saint and I 'm not a fool . How can I live on what they offer to pay me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>Stay for a little , while you 're looking for something else .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADAME CHANTEUIL</speaker>
       <p>Look for something else ! Never ! That means all the horrors I went through , before I came here , over again ! No ! no ! no ! Never ! Looking for work means trailing through the mud , toiling up stairs , ringing bells , being told to call again , calling again to get more snubs . And then when one thinks one 's found something one comes up against a door guarded by a man who 's watching you , and who 's got to be satisfied before you can get into the workroom , or the office , or the shop , or whatever it may be . And then you 've got to begin again with somebody else and be snubbed again . No . Since it 's an accepted , settled , decided thing that the only career for a woman is to satisfy the passions of a man , I prefer the one I 've chosen myself .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>And what if he goes off and leaves you with a baby ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADAME CHANTEUIL</speaker>
       <p>Well , I 'll bring it up . I sha n't be the first . Women do it . It happens to one in every five in Paris . Ask Mademoiselle de Meuriot , the old maid , if she would n't be glad to have one now ? When one grows old it 's better to have had a child in that way than not to have had one at all . Ask her if I 'm not telling the truth . Ask her if she 's happy in her loneliness .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT</speaker>
       <p>Oh , it 's true — it 's true ! Sometimes — She bursts into tears . Thérèse goes to her and takes her in her arms .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Oh , Mademoiselle , dear Mademoiselle ! MADAME CHANTEUIL [ between her teeth ] Good-bye , Mademoiselle . Good-bye , Thérèse . MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT [ to Madame Chanteuil ] Wait , wait . I 'm going with you . I am not going to leave you just now . Mademoiselle de Meuriot goes out with Madame Chanteuil . Thérèse , left alone , buries her head in her hands and thinks . Then she takes the two books that Madame Nérisse has handed her , and with a determined swing sits down and starts working . After a moment Monsieur Nérisse comes in .</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . My dear child , I have news for you . Pleasant news , I think . THÉRÈSE [ rather grimly ] Have you ?</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . One little smile , please , or I shall tell you nothing .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I assure you smiling is the last thing I feel like .</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . If you only knew what I 've been doing for you , you would n't receive me so unkindly .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . You can do nothing for me . Will you please leave me alone ?</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . I do n't deserve to be spoken to like that , Thérèse . Listen ; we must come to an understanding . I know you 're angry with me still about what happened last month . I promised you then I would say no more . Have I kept my word ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes , you have .</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . Will you always be angry ? Is it quite impossible for us to be friends ? I am constantly giving you proofs of my friendship . I 've done two things for you quite lately . The first was that letter to the editor you 're going to see to-morrow , and the second is what I 've done now with our new backer . It 's this . They wanted to sack you or to offer you humiliating conditions . I said if you did n't stay I would n't stay either . I gave in on other points to get my way about this . I shall have their final answer to-morrow , and I know I shall succeed if I stick to my point .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . But what right had you to do such a thing ? We agreed to forget altogether that you had dared to make love to me . D'you really not understand how that makes it impossible I should ever accept either assistance or protection from you ?</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . I have still the right to love you in secret .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Indeed you have not , and you 've kept your secret precious badly . Madame Nérisse suspects , and I can see quite well that she 's jealous of me . I owe her a great deal ; she gave me my first start and got me my place here . I would n't make her unhappy for anything in the world . As soon as she hears of what you 've done what d'you suppose she 'll think ?</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . I do n't care a rap what she thinks .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . But I care very much . You 've compromised me seriously . NÉRISSE [ sincerely contemptuous ] Compromised you ! Aha , yes , there 's the word ! Oh , you middle class girls ! Always the same ! What are you doing here then ? What d'you know about life ? Nothing . Compromised ! Then all your dreams of elevating humanity , all your ambitions , your career , the realization of yourself — you 'll give up all that before you 'll be what you describe by that stupid , imbecile , middle class word , compromised . When you shook yourself free of your family you behaved like a capable woman . Now you 're behaving and thinking like a fashionable doll . Is n't that true ? I appeal to your intelligence , to your mind , to everything in you that lifts you out of the ordinary ruck . Your precious word compromised is only the twaddle of a countrified miss . Do n't you see that yourself ? THÉRÈSE [ very much out of countenance ] Ah , if I were only certain that you are hiding nothing behind your friendship and your sympathy ! NÉRISSE [ with perfectly genuine indignation ] Hiding ? You said hiding ? Is that what you throw in my face ? You insult me ? What d'you take me for ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I beg your pardon .</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . What kind of assurance do you want me to give you ? Do you believe in nothing ? Is it quite impossible for you to feel frankly and naturally , and to say “ I have confidence in you , and I accept your friendship ” — a friendship offered to you perfectly honestly and loyally ? It really drives one to despair . THÉRÈSE [ without enthusiasm ] Well , yes . I say it . She puts her hands into the hands Monsieur Nérisse holds out to her .</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . Thank you . [ A silence . Then he says in a low voice ] Oh , Thérèse , I love you , how I love you ! THÉRÈSE [ snatching her hands away ] Oh , this is abominable . You set a trap for me , and my vanity made me fall into it .</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . I implore you to let me tell you about myself . I 'm so miserable and lonely when you 're away . THÉRÈSE [ trying to speak reasonably ] I know quite well what you want to say to me , and it all amounts to this : you love me . It 's quite clear , and I answer you just as clearly : I do not love you .</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . I 'm so unhappy !</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . If it 's true that you 're unhappy because I do n't love you , that is a misfortune for you ; a misfortune for which I am not in any way responsible , because you certainly cannot accuse me of having encouraged you .</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . I do n't ask you to love me — yet . I ask you to allow me to try and win your love . THÉRÈSE [ almost desperate ] Do n't dare to say that again . If you were an honorable man , you could n't possibly have said these things to me to-day when my living depends upon you . You know the position I 'm in , and you know that if I do n't stay here , there are only two courses open to me — to go and live at the expense of my godmother , which I will not do , or to take the chances of a woman alone looking for work in Paris . Do n't you understand that speaking about your love for me to-day is the same as driving me into the street ?</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . If you go into the street , it is by your own choice .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Exactly . There 's the old , everlasting , scandalous bargain . Sell yourself or you shall starve . If I give in , I can stay ; if I do n't —</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . I did n't say so . But clearly my efforts to help you will be greater if I know that I 'm working for my friend .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . You actually confess it ! You think yourself an honorable man , and you do n't see that what you 're doing is the vilest of crimes .</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . Now I ask you . Did I wait for your answer before I began to defend you and to help you ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . No , but you believe I shall give in through gratitude or fear . Well , do n't count upon it . Even if I have to kill myself in the end , I shall never sell myself , either to you or to anyone else . [ In despair ] Then that 's what it comes to . Wherever we want to make our way , to have the right to work and to live , we find the door barred by a man who says , Give yourself or starve . Because one 's on one 's own , because they know that there 's not another man to start up and defend his property ! It 's almost impossible to believe human beings can be so vile to one another . For food ! Just for food ! Because they know we shall starve if we do n't give in . Because we have old people , or children at home who are waiting for us to bring them food , men put this vile condition to us , to do like the girls in the streets . It 's shameful , shameful , shameful . It 's enough to make one shriek out loud with rage and despair . NÉRISSE [ speaking sternly ] I 've never asked you to sell yourself . I ask you to love me .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I shall never love you . NÉRISSE [ as before ] You 'll never love . Neither me nor others . Listen — THÉRÈSE [ interrupting ] I — NÉRISSE [ preventing her from speaking ] Wait ; I insist upon speaking . You will never love , you say . You will live alone all your life . You 're foolish and self-confident enough to think that you can do without a man 's affection .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . But I — NÉRISSE [ continuing ] I must try to make you understand your folly . These efforts you 're making to escape from the ordinary life of affection are useless , and it 's lucky for you they are useless . You can n't live without love .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Why ?</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . All lonely people are wretched . But the lonely woman is twice , a hundred times more wretched than the man . You 've no idea what it is . It 's to pass all your life under suspicion , yes , suspicion . The world never believes that people live differently from others unless they have secret reasons , and the world always says that secret reasons are shameful reasons . And that 's not all . Think of the lonely room where you may cry without anyone to hear you . Think of illness where to your bodily pain is added the mental torture of the fear of dying all alone . Think of the empty heart , the empty arms always , always . And in old age , more wretchedness in the regret for a wasted life . And for what and for whom are you making this sacrifice ? For a convention ; for a morality that nobody really believes in . Who 'll think the better of you for it ? People wo n't even believe in your honesty . They will find explanations for it that would make you die of shame if you knew them . Is that what you want , Thérèse ? I am unhappy . Love me . Oh , if you only —</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Please spare me your confidences .</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . You think this is only a caprice on my part . You are mistaken . I ask you to share my life .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I will never be your mistress .</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . You 're proud and you 're strong . You insist upon marriage . Very well . I agree .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I will not have you ! I will not have you !</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . Why ? Tell me why .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I will tell you why ; and then , I hope , I shall have done with you . You 're right in one way . I believe I should not be able to live all alone . I should be too unhappy . But at least I 'll keep my right of choice . If ever I give myself to anyone , it will be to someone I love . [ With vehemence ] And I love him , I love him ! NÉRISSE [ violently ] You have a lover ! If that 's true — THÉRÈSE [ with a cry of triumph ] Oh , have I got to the bottom of your vulgar , hateful little soul ? If there ever was any danger of my giving in , your expression then would have saved me . You never thought there could be anything better . A lover ! No , I have no lover . I have a love .</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . I do n't see so very much difference . THÉRÈSE [ proudly ] I know you do n't , and that shows what you are . This is the one love of my life , my love for my betrothed . I lost my money and that separated us , but we found each other again . It 's unhappy to be separated , but we bear our unhappiness out of respect for what you call prejudices , because we know how our defying them would hurt those we love . You think me ridiculous , but you cannot imagine how utterly indifferent I am . I am waiting , we are waiting , with perfect trust and love . Now d'you understand that I 'm perfectly safe from you ? Go ! NÉRISSE [ in a low voice which trembles with anger and jealousy ] How dare you say that to me , Thérèse ? How dare you bring such a picture before me ? I will not allow you to belong to another man . [ He advances towards her ] THÉRÈSE [ in violent excitement ] No , no , do n't dare ! Do n't touch me ! do n't dare to touch me ! She cries out those words with such violence and in a voice of such authority that Nérisse stops and drops into a chair .</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . Forgive me . I 'm out of my mind . I do n't know what I 'm doing . THÉRÈSE [ in a low , forced voice ] Will you go ? I 've work to do .</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . Yes , I 'll go . [ He rises and says humbly ] I want to ask you — you wo n't leave us ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . You dare to say that ? You think I 'll expose myself a second time to a scene like this . Yes ! I shall leave , and leave to-night ! Will you go ?</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . I implore you . [ Hearing a noise outside , suddenly alarmed ] Here she is ! Control yourself , I beg of you . Do n't tell her .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . You need n't be afraid . Madame Nérisse comes in . MADAME NÉRISSE [ looking from one to the other ] What 's going on here ?</stage>
      <stage>NÉRISSE . Mademoiselle Thérèse says that she 's going to leave us , and I tried to make her understand — perhaps you could do something — I must go out .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Yes . Go . He takes his hat and goes out at the back .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . You wish to leave us ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes , Madame .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Because Monsieur Nérisse —?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes , Madame . MADAME NÉRISSE [ troubled and sad ] What can I say to you ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Nothing , Madame .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . My poor child .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I do n't want pity . Do n't be unhappy about me . I shall be able to manage for myself . I have plenty of courage .</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . I 'm so ashamed to let you go like this . How honest and loyal you are ! [ To herself ] I was honest too , once .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Good-bye , Madame . [ She begins to tidy her papers</stage>
      <stage>MADAME NÉRISSE . Good-bye , Thérèse . Madame Nérisse goes out . When Thérèse is left alone she breaks down and bursts out crying like a little child . Then she wipes her eyes , puts her hat on , goes to the cardboard box , and takes out her veil , which she slips into her little bag . She takes out Monsieur Nérisse 's letter ; still crying she puts the letter into another envelope , which she closes and leaves well in sight upon the table . Then she takes her little black moleskin bag and her umbrella and goes out slowly . She is worn out , almost stooping ; and , as the curtain falls , one sees the poor little figure departing , its shoulders shaken by sobs .</stage>

      <stage type="setting">
       <stage>SCENE :— Thérèse 's studio at the bookbinding workshops of Messrs. Féliat and Guéret at Evreux . Strewn about are materials for binding books : patterns , tools , and silks . A glazed door on the right opens into the general women 's workshops , and there is a door leading into a small office on the left . In the middle , towards the back , is a large drawing table ; several easels stand about . There are some chairs and a small bureau . Cards hang upon the walls , on which are printed the text of the Factory Laws . There is a door at the back .</stage>
       <stage>It is October .</stage>
       <stage>Monsieur Guéret and Monsieur Féliat come in excitedly .</stage>
      </stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . I tell you Duriot 's men are coming out on strike .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . And I ask you , what 's that to me ?</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Ours will do the same .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Oh no , they wo n't .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . You 'll see .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Duriot 's men are furious with the women because of what happened last year .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . They say woman 's the enemy in business .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Let ‘ em talk .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . They want Duriot to sack all his women .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . And I 've told you why . There 's no danger of anything like that happening here .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . You think so , do you ? Well , you 'll see .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . We shall see .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . You 'll give in only after they 've broken two or three of your machines as they did Duriot 's , or done something worse , perhaps .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . My dear Guéret , I get out of the women for a cent what I have to pay the men three cents for . And as long as I can economize ten cents on the piece I shall go on .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . You 'll regret it . If I was in your place — [ He stops</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Well , what would you do if you were in my place ?</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . What should I do ?</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Yes , what ?</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . I should n't take long to think . I 'd cut off a finger to save my hand , I 'd turn out every one of the women to-morrow .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . You 're mad . You 've always objected to my employing women , and I know very well why .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Well , let 's hear why .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . You want to know . Well , because you 've been jealous of Thérèse ever since she came here six months ago .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Oh , I say !</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . That 's it ; my sister can n't endure her .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Marguerite —</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . You know she would n't even see her when she came down from Paris ; and if Thérèse got work here , it was in spite of Marguerite . I was wiser than you about this . The girl 's courage appealed to me . She 's plucky and intelligent . Oh , I do n't want to make myself out cleverer than I am . I took her a bit out of pity , and I thought she 'd draw me a few designs ; that was all I expected . But she has energy and initiative . She organized the two workrooms , and now she 's got the whole thing into order by starting this Union .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . The Hen 's Union .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . What ?</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . That 's what the men call her Union . You should hear the things they say about it .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Well , long live the Hen 's Union ! A hen 's plucky when it has to be .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Seriously , it 's just this Union which has annoyed the men . They feel it 's dangerous .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Very well . I 'll be ready for them . Thérèse comes in .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . I 'll go and find out what 's going on .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Yes , do . Monsieur Guéret goes out .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I 've just been seeing the man who makes our finishing tools . He says it 's perfectly easy to make a tool from the drawing I did that wo n't be more expensive than the old one . [ Looking for a paper and finding it on the table ] Here 's the drawing . You see I 've thought of cheapness , but I 've not sacrificed utility . After all , it 's only a copy of a Grolier , just a little altered .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Very good , but what will the price come out at ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . How much do you think .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . I can easily do it . [ He calculates during what follows</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . The beating wo n't be done with a hammer , but in the rolling machine ; the sawing-in and the covering will be done as usual . FÉLIAT [ having finished his sum ] Two francs forty . THÉRÈSE [ triumphantly ] One franc seventy . You 've calculated on the basis of men 's work . But , if you approve , I 'll open a new workroom for women in the old shop . Lucienne can manage it . I could let Madame Princeteau take Lucienne 's present place , and I 'll turn out the stuff at the price I quoted .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . But that 's first-rate . I give you an absolutely free hand .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Thank you , Monsieur Féliat .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . How do you think the men will take it ? You know that last year , before you came here , a strike of the workmen was broken by the women taking the work the men were asking a rise for — taking it at lower wages , too . Since then the men feel very strongly against the women . Your godfather is anxious about it .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Oh , leave it to me , I 'm not afraid .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Well done . I like pluck . Go ahead . How lucky I was to get you here .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . How grateful I am to you for believing in me . [ Lucienne appears at the door on the right . She is speaking to a workwoman who is not visible , while the following conversation goes on ] And how good you are , too , to have given work to poor Lucienne . When I think what you saved her from ! She really owes her life to you . At any rate she owes it to you that she 's living respectably .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Well , I owe you ten per cent reduction on my general expenses . [ With a change of tone ] Then that 's agreed ? You 're going ahead ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes , Monsieur .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . I 'll go and give the necessary orders . [ He goes out</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . It 's all right . It 's done . He 's agreed ! I 'm to have my new workroom , and you 're to be the head of it .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , splendid ! Then I 'm really of some importance here at last .<stage>A long happy sigh</stage>Oh dear , how happy I am . I 'd never have believed I could have enjoyed the smell of a bindery so .<stage>Sniffing</stage>Glue , and white of egg , and old leather ; it 's lovely ! Oh , Thérèse , what you did for me in bringing me here ! What I owe you ! That 's what a woman 's being free means ; it means a woman who earns her own living .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Oh , you 're right ! Is n't it splendid , Lucienne , ten wretched women saved , thanks to our new workshop . I 've seen Duriot 's forewoman . At any moment fifty women from there may be out of work . I can take on only ten at present , and I 've had to choose . That was dreadful ! Thirty of them are near starvation . I took the worst cases : the old maids , the girls with babies , the ones whose husbands have gone off and left them , the widows . Every one of those , but for me , would have been starved or gone on the streets . I used to want to write books and realize my dreams that way . Now I can realize them by work . I wish Caroline Legrand could know what I 'm doing . It was she who helped me to get over my silly pride , and come and ask for work here .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>Dear Caroline Legrand ! Without her ! Without you !<stage>With a change of tone</stage>What d'you suppose happened to me this morning ? I had a visit from Monsieur Gambard . THÉRÈSE<stage>laughing</stage>Another visit ! I shall be jealous !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>You 've reason . For the last week that excellent old man has come every single morning with a book for me to bind . I begged him not to take so much trouble , and I told him that if he had more work for us to do , we could send for the books to his house . What d'you think he did to-day ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I 've no idea .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>He asked me to marry him .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . My dear ! What then ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>Why , then I told him that I was married and separated from my husband .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . There 's such a thing as divorce .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>Naughty girl ! That 's exactly what he said . I told him that my first experience of marriage was not calculated to make me run the chances of a second . And then he asked me to be his mistress .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Indignation of Lucienne !</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>No ! I really could n't be angry . He offered so naïvely to settle part of his fortune upon me that I was disarmed . I simply told him I was able to earn my own living , so I was not obliged to sell myself .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . And he went off ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>And he went off . THÉRÈSE<stage>starting suddenly</stage>Was that three o'clock that struck .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , but there 's nothing very extraordinary in that .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Not for you , perhaps . But I made up my mind not to think about a certain thing until it was three o'clock . I stuck to it — almost — not very easily . Well , my dear , three o'clock tohYpppHeNday is a most solemn hour in my life .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>You do n't say so !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I do . Lucienne , I am so happy . I do n't know how I can have deserved to be as happy as I am .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>Good gracious , what 's happened in the last five minutes ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I 'll tell you . One hour ago René arrived at Evreux . He 's come back from Tunis . Come back a success and a somebody . And now — Vincent , a workman , comes in .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>VINCENT</speaker>
       <p>Good-morning , Mademoiselle Thérèse . I want a word with you , because it 's you who engages —</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Not the workmen .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>VINCENT</speaker>
       <p>I know . But it 's about a woman , about my wife . THÉRÈSE<stage>sharply</stage>Your wife ? But I do n't want your wife .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>VINCENT</speaker>
       <p>I heard as how you were taking on hands .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes , but I choose them carefully . First of all I take the ones who need work or are not wanted at home .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>VINCENT</speaker>
       <p>You 're quite right — but I ai n't asking you to pay my old woman very much — not as much as a man .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Why not , if she does the same work ? VINCENT [ with male superiority ] Well , in the first place , she 's only a woman ; and , besides , if you did n't make a bit out of it , you would n't take her in the place of a man .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . But you get excellent wages here yourself . You can live without forcing your wife to work .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>VINCENT</speaker>
       <p>Well , anyhow , her few halfpence would be enough to pay for my tobacco . LUCIENNE<stage>laughing</stage>Come , you do n't smoke as much as all that .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>VINCENT</speaker>
       <p>Besides , it 'll put a bit more butter on the bread .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . But your wife will take the place of another woman who has n't even dry bread perhaps .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>VINCENT</speaker>
       <p>Oh , if one was bothering all the time about other people 's troubles , you 'd have enough to do !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Now will you forgive me if I meddle a little in what is n't exactly my business ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>VINCENT</speaker>
       <p>Oh , go on , you wo n't upset me .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . What d'you do when you leave the works ? You go to the saloon ? VINCENT [ losing control of himself and becoming violent and coarse ] That 's yer game , is it ! You take me for a regler soaker . That 's a bit too thick , that is . You can go and ask for yourself in all the saloons round here . Blimey , sometimes I do n't drink nothing but water for a week on end ! Can you find anybody as has ever seen me blue-blind-paralytic — eh ? I 'm one of the steady ones , I am . I has a tiddley in the morning , like every man as is a man , to keep out the fog ; then I has a Vermouth before lunch , and a drop of something short after , just to oil the works like — and that 's the bloomin ’ lot . Of course you 're bound to have a Pernod before dinner to get your appetite up ; and if I go for a smoke and a wet after supper , well , it 's for the sake of a bit of company . THÉRÈSE [ who has been jotting down figures with a pencil while he has been talking ] Well , that 's a franc a day you might have saved .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>VINCENT</speaker>
       <p>A franc . THÉRÈSE<stage>holding out the paper to him</stage>Add it up . VINCENT<stage>a little confused</stage>Oh , I 'll take your word for it . I ai n't much good at sums .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . With that franc you might have put a fine lot of butter on every round of bread .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>VINCENT</speaker>
       <p>Well , look here , I want a bicycle .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Why ? You live five minutes ’ walk from here .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>VINCENT</speaker>
       <p>Yes , but I want to get about a bit on Sundays .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . There 's one thing you have n't thought of . You have two little children . Who 'll look after them if your wife comes to work here ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>VINCENT</speaker>
       <p>Do n't you worry about that . You takes ‘ em all dirty to the crèche every morning and gets ‘ em back in the evenin ’ all tidied up .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . And who 's going to get supper ready ? VINCENT [ naïvely ] Why , the old woman when she comes back from work .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . While you take your little drink ? VINCENT [ the same tone ] Oh , yes ; I sha n't hurry her up too much .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Who 'll mend your clothes ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>VINCENT</speaker>
       <p>Why , the old woman of course .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . When ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>VINCENT</speaker>
       <p>On Sundays .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . While you go off for a run on the bicycle ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>VINCENT</speaker>
       <p>Yes ; it 'll be a change for her . And at night I 'll take her to see me play billiards .<stage>With a change of tone</stage>That 's all settled , ai n't it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Indeed , it 's not .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>VINCENT</speaker>
       <p>Why not ? Are n't you going to open a new workroom ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Your wife has no need to work .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>VINCENT</speaker>
       <p>What 's that got to do with you ? You 're taking on the others .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . The others are in want .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>VINCENT</speaker>
       <p>That 's nothing to me . You ought to take the wives of the chaps as works here first .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . All I can do is to mention her name at the next meeting of our Union .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>VINCENT</speaker>
       <p>Oh , damn your Union — it 's a fair nuisance !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . A Union is always a nuisance to somebody .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>VINCENT</speaker>
       <p>And you 'll ask your Union not to take my old woman ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I certainly shall . VINCENT [ rather threateningly ] Very well . Things was more comfortable here before you come from Paris , you know . THÉRÈSE [ quietly ] I 'm sorry .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>VINCENT</speaker>
       <p>And they 'll be more comfortable when you take your hook back .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . That wo n't be for a good while yet .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>VINCENT</speaker>
       <p>I ai n't so damned sure about that ! Good-afternoon .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Good-afternoon . He goes out .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LUCIENNE</speaker>
       <p>You 've made an enemy , my dear .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I do n't care as long as I 'm able to prevent women being driven to work to pay for their husbands ’ idleness and drunkenness . Féliat and Guéret come in . Lucienne goes out .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Tell me , Mademoiselle , if there was a strike here , could you count upon your workwomen ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I 'm sure I could .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Are you certain none of them would go back on you ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Two or three married women might if their husbands threatened them .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Will you try , in a quiet way , to find out about that ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes , certainly . [ She makes a movement to go out</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Look here , it seems that Duriot has just had a visit from two delegates from the Central Committee in Paris , who were sent down to protest against the engagement of women . I 'm afraid we 're going to have trouble here .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . The conditions here are very different from those at Duriot 's .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . All the same , find out what you can .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I will , at once . [ She goes towards the door</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Whatever happens we must send off that Brazilian order . How is it getting on ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . We shall have everything ready in three days . I 'll go and inquire about the other thing .</stage>
      <stage>She goes out</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Good .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Three days is n't the end of the world . I think I can promise you to keep my men as long as that .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . If it 's absolutely necessary , one might make them some little concessions .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . I 'll do all I can .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Yes . And if they 're too exacting , we 'll let them go , and the women shall get the stuff finished up for us . [ There is a knock at the door ] Come in . René comes in .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Hullo !</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . René !</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . You or your ghost ?</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Where do you come from ? Nobody 's heard of you for a hundred years .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Come now , only six months , and you 've had some news .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Where are you from last ?</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . From Tunis .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . And what are you doing here ?</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . I 'll tell you all about it . I want to have a bit of a talk with you .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Well , we 're listening .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . You 're mighty solemn about it .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . It 's extremely serious business .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Do n't be tragic . You 're here safe and sound ; and you 've not lost money , because you 'd none to lose .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . I 've come to marry Thérèse .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Well , I must say you do n't beat about the bush .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . But it 's to your own people you 've got to say that . What the devil —! Thérèse has no more money than she had a year ago . So —</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . I 'll marry her in spite of them .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Well , we 've nothing to do with it .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Yes , but I do n't want to marry her in spite of you .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Nor in spite of herself .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . I 'm certain she wo n't say no .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . But a year ago you solemnly separated ; you both agreed everything was over .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Nothing was over . A year ago I was a fool .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . To the point again .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . And what are you now ?</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . At any rate I am not quite useless any longer . I 'm not a boy now , obliged to do what he 's told because he 's perfectly incapable of doing for himself .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Have you found something to do ?</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . I 'm in phosphates .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . And what the devil are you in phosphates ?</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Representative .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . How do you mean ?</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . A commercial traveller , as father said with great contempt .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Well , it was not with a view to that sort of future that he had you called to the Bar .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . At the Bar I could have earned my own living in about ten years — possibly . When I had to give up marrying Thérèse I saw how useless I was . Thanks to her I found myself out . She gave me a bit of her own courage . She woke up my self-respect . Besides , after that I had something to work for , an aim , and I seemed to understand why I was alive . I worked and read a lot ; my firm noticed me ; they sent me to Tunis . I asked them to let me give up clerk work and have a try on my own . Over there I got into touch with three small firms . I placed their goods . I earn four hundred francs a month . Next year I mean to start a little branch in this district where we will manufacture superphosphates . From now until then I shall travel about the district and try and get customers ; and my wife — and Thérèse — will go on with her work here , if you will be so good as to keep her .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Ouf ! Think of a young man who can talk as long as that , without taking breath , giving up the Bar . What a pity ! FÉLIAT [ to René ] Have you told all that to your people ?</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Yes . They 're not at all proud of my business . And after refusing to let me marry Thérèse because she had no money they wo n't let me marry her now because she works for her living . To be directress of a bindery , even of your bindery , uncle , is not distinguished enough for them .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Well , my boy , you certainly could n't have stood up to things like that a year ago . What d'you want us to do for you ? Thérèse does n't want our consent to marry ; nor do you . While Monsieur Féliat has been speaking , old Mother Bougne has come in from the right . She is a poor old workwoman who walks with difficulty , leaning on a broom , from which one feels that she never parts . She has a bunch of keys at her waistbelt ; her apron is turned up and makes a sort of pocket into which she slips pieces of paper and scraps that she picks up from the floor . René looks at her with surprise .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . You 're looking at Mother Bougne . Good-morning , Mother Bougne .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MOTHER BOUGNE</speaker>
       <p>Good-morning , Monsieur Féliat .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . When does the Committee of your Union sit ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MOTHER BOUGNE</speaker>
       <p>On Wednesday , Monsieur Féliat .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . You wo n't miss it , will you ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MOTHER BOUGNE</speaker>
       <p>I have n't missed one up to now , Monsieur Féliat .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . That 's right . [ She goes out at the back during what follows . Monsieur Féliat turns to René and says ] We call Mother Bougne our Minister of the Interior , because she tries to keep the place tidy . She 's been a weaver near Rouen since she was eight years old ; she 's been stranded here .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . And she 's a member of the Committee of the Union ?</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Yes , she 's a member . Thérèse insisted on it . When Thérèse founded a Woman 's Trade Union here she had the nice idea of including among them this poor old creature , wrecked by misery and hard work . Our Thérèse has ideas like that . [ With a change of tone ] But business , business . What do you want us to do for you ?</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . I 've come to ask you two things . The first is to try to get round my people .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Well , I 'll try . But I know your father . He 's even more obstinate than I am myself . I sha n't make the smallest impression upon him . What else ?</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . I want to have a talk with Thérèse in your presence .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . In our presence ! Now listen , my boy . Our presence will be much more useful in the work rooms . We have our hands full here . You 've dropped in just at the point of a split between workmen and employers . Besides , to tell you the truth , I think I know pretty well what you have to say to Thérèse . I 'll send her to you . And , look here , do n't keep her too long , because she 's got her hands full too . [ To Guéret ] Will you go and telephone to Duriot 's ? GUÉRET [ looking at his watch ] Yes , there might be some news . [ He goes out ] FÉLIAT [ to René ] And I 'll send Thérèse here . He goes out and René is alone for a few moments . Then Thérèse comes in . They advance towards each other quietly .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . How do you do , René ?</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . How are you , Thérèse ? They shake hands , then , giving way to their feelings , they kiss each other tenderly and passionately . THÉRÈSE [ in a low voice ] That 'll do ; do n't , René dear . [ She withdraws gently from his embrace ] Do n't . Let 's talk . Have you seen your people ?</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Yes .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Well ?</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Well , Thérèse , they wo n't come to our wedding .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . They still refuse their consent ?</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . We can do without it .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . But they refuse it ?</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Yes . Forgive me , my dearest , for asking you to take just my own self . Do you love me enough to marry me quite simply , without any relations , since I leave my relations for your sake ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . My dear , we must n't do that ; we must wait .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . No , I wo n't wait . I wo n't lose the best time of my life , and years of happiness , for the sake of prejudices I do n't believe in . Do you remember what you said to me the night we played Barberine ? You were splendid . You said : “ Marry me all the same , in spite of my poverty . ” [ She makes a movement to stop him ] Oh , let me — please let me go on ! I was only a miserable weakling then , I was frightened about the future . But you roused me and set me going . If I 'm a man now , it 's to you I owe it . Thanks to you I know how splendid it is to trust one 's self and struggle , and hope , and succeed . Now I can come to you and say : “ I am the man you wanted me to be , let us marry and live together . ” Oh , together , together ! How splendid it sounds ! Do you remember how you said that night long ago : “ Let us conquer our place in the world together ” ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Oh , René ! René ! We must wait !</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Why ? Why must we wait ? What possible reason can you have for not doing now what you wanted me to do a year ago ? Do n't you believe in me ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Oh yes , yes . It 's not that !</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . What is it then ? Thérèse , you frighten me . It seems as if you were hiding something from me .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . No , no . What an idea !</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Is it — oh , can it be that you do n't love me so much ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Oh , René , no , no . Do n't think that for a moment .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . But you 're not being straight with me . You 're hiding something .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Do n't ask me .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Thérèse !</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Oh , please do n't ask me !</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Now , you know very well that 's impossible . How can there be secrets between us ? You and I are the sort of people who are straight with one another . I must have my share in everything that makes you unhappy .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Well , then , I must tell you . It 's about your father and mother . Oh , how I wish I need n't tell you . René , while you 've been away your people have been dreadful to me . Your father came here to see me . He wanted me to swear never to see you again — never . Of course I would n't . When I refused to give in he said it was through worldly wisdom . He said : “ If he was n't going to inherit my money , you would n't hang on to him like this . ” He dared to say that to me , René — your father whom I have always wanted to respect and love . He thought that of me . And then I swore to him , and I 've sworn to myself , that I 'll never marry you , never , without his consent . I cannot be suspected of that . You understand , do n't you ? The poorer I am the prouder I ought to be . [ She bursts into tears ] My dear — my dear ! How unhappy I am ! How dreadfully unhappy I am !</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . My darling ! [ He kisses her</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Do n't , René ! I could n't help telling you . But you understand , my dearest , that we 've got to wait until he knows me better . RENÉ [ forcibly ] No . We will not wait .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I 'll never break my word .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . What d'you want us to wait for ? A change of opinion that 'll probably never come . And our youth will go , we shall have spoilt our lives . You want to send me back to Paris all alone and unhappy , to spend long silent evenings thinking about you and suffering from not being with you , while you , here , will be suffering in the same way , in the same loneliness . And we love each other , and it absolutely depends only on ourselves whether we shall change our double unhappiness for a double joy . [ Changing his tone ] I can n't stand it , Thérèse . I 've loved you for two years , and all this last year I 've toiled and slaved to win you . [ Low and ardently ] I want you .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Oh , hush , hush !</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . I want you . You 're the one woman I 've loved in my life . My love for you is my life . I can n't give up my life . Listen : I have to be in Paris this evening ; are you going to let me leave you broken-hearted ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Do you think that I 'm not broken-hearted ?</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . I sha n't suffer any the less because I know that you 're suffering too .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . It does n't depend upon us .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . It depends entirely upon us . Look here , if people refuse to let us marry , our love for each other is strong enough to do without marriage . Thérèse , come with me !</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Oh , René , René ! What are you asking me to do ?</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Have you faith in me ? Look at me . Do you think I 'm sincere ? Do you think I 'm an honest man ? Do you think that , if people refuse to let us go through a ridiculous ceremony together , our union will be any the less durable ? Is it the ceremony that makes it real ? Thérèse , come with me . Come this evening ; let 's go together ; let 's love each other . Oh , if you loved me as much as I love you , you would n't hesitate for a second .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Oh , do n't say that , I implore you !</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Then you do n't trust me ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I wo n't do it . I wo n't do it .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . What prevents you ? You 're absolutely alone , you have no relations . You owe nothing to anybody . No one will suffer for your action . You 've already given a year of your life to the foolish prejudices of society . You 've shown them respect enough . First they prevented our marriage because you were poor ; now they want to prevent it because you work . Thanks to you I have been able to assert myself and get free . My father and mother can keep their money . I do n't want it . Come . THÉRÈSE [ in tears ] You 're torturing me . Oh , my dear , you 're making me most unhappy . I could never do that , never . Do n't be angry with me . I love you . I swear that I love you .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . I love you , Thérèse . I swear that I love you . All my life is yours . [ He breaks down ] Do n't make me so unhappy . The more unhappy , the more I love you .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I could n't do it . Monsieur Féliat comes in .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Hullo ! Was it to make her cry like that that you wanted to see her ? Is that what you 've learnt “ in phosphates ” ? [ To Thérèse ] Do n't , my dear . [ In a tone of kindly remonstrance ] You ! Is it you I find crying like a little schoolgirl ? [ Thérèse wipes her eyes ] Oh , I understand all about it . But his father will give in in the end . And you , René , be reasonable , do n't hurry things .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . But I want — FÉLIAT [ interrupting him ] No , no , for goodness ’ sake , not just now . We 'll talk about it later on . Just now we have other fish to fry . We 're in a fix , my young lover . We 've got to face some very serious difficulties . Go along with you . Monsieur Guéret comes in . GUÉRET [ to Monsieur Féliat ] One of the delegates of the Central Committee is outside .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . And what does the brute want ? GUÉRET [ makes a gesture of caution and points to the door ] He wishes to speak to the Chairman of the Women 's Union .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Oh , ask the gentleman in . [ To René ] My boy , you must be off . I 'll see you presently .</stage>
      <stage>RENÉ . Yes , presently . THÉRÈSE [ aside to René ] Be at the station half an hour before the train goes . I 'll be there to say good-bye . René goes out . Monsieur Guéret brings in the delegate and goes out again himself .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Good-morning . What can I do for you ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELEGATE</speaker>
       <p>I am a delegate from the Central Committee in Paris .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . I am Monsieur Féliat , the owner of these works . I 'm at your service .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELEGATE</speaker>
       <p>It 's not to you I wish to speak . This is a question which does n't concern you .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Which does n't concern me !</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELEGATE</speaker>
       <p>Not at present , at any rate . Will you kindly tell me where I can find the person I have come to see ? FÉLIAT<stage>furious</stage>I —<stage>controlling himself</stage>She is here .<stage>He indicates Thérèse</stage>Monsieur Féliat goes out to the right .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELEGATE</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Mademoiselle , I 'm here as the representative of the Central</l>
        <l>Committee in Paris to request you to break up your Women 's Union .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . So that 's it .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELEGATE</speaker>
       <p>That 's it .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . What harm does it do you ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELEGATE</speaker>
       <p>It strengthens you too much against us .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . If I asked you to break up yours for the same reason , what would you say to me ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELEGATE</speaker>
       <p>Our union is to fight the masters ; yours is to fight us .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . It does you no harm whatever .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELEGATE</speaker>
       <p>Your union supports a movement we 've decided to fight .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . What movement ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELEGATE</speaker>
       <p>The movement of the competition of women , the invasion of the labor market by female labor .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Not a very dangerous invasion .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELEGATE</speaker>
       <p>You think not . Listen . I 've just come down from Paris . Who gave me my railway ticket ? A woman . Who did I find behind the counter at the Post Office ? A woman . Who was at the end of the telephone wire ? A woman . I had to get some money ; it was a woman who gave it to me at the bank . I do n't even speak of the women doctors and lawyers . And in industry , like everywhere else , women want to supplant us . There are women now even in the metal-working shops . Everyone has the right to defend himself against competition . The workmen are going to defend themselves .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Without troubling about the consequences . To take away a woman 's right to work is to condemn her to starvation or prostitution . You 're not competitors , you 're enemies .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELEGATE</speaker>
       <p>You 're mistaken . We 're so little the enemies of the women that in asking you to do away with your Union we 're speaking in your own interest .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Bah !</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELEGATE</speaker>
       <p>We do n't want women to take lower wages than ours .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I know the phrase . “ Equal wages for equal work . ”</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELEGATE</speaker>
       <p>That 's absolutely just .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . The masters wo n't give those equal wages .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELEGATE</speaker>
       <p>The women have a means of forcing them to ; they can strike .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . We do n't wish to employ those means .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELEGATE</speaker>
       <p>I beg your pardon , the women would consent at once . It 's you that prevent them , through the Union that you 've started . Is n't that so ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . That is so . But you know why .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELEGATE</speaker>
       <p>No , I do not know why .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Then I will tell you why . It is because the phrase only seems to be just and generous . You know very well that here , at any rate , the owner would not employ any more women if he had to pay them the same wages he pays the men . And if they struck , he 'd replace them by men . Your apparent solicitude is only hypocrisy . In reality you want to get rid of the women .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELEGATE</speaker>
       <p>Well , I admit that . The women are not competitors ; they 're enemies . In every dispute they 'll take the side of the masters .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . How d'you know that ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELEGATE</speaker>
       <p>They 've always done it , because women take orders by instinct . They 're humble , and docile , and easily frightened .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Why do n't you say inferiors , at once ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELEGATE</speaker>
       <p>Well , yes ; inferiors , the majority of them .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . If they 're inferiors , it 's only right that they should take lower wages .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELEGATE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , I did n't mean to say — THÉRÈSE<stage>interrupting him</stage>But it 's not true — they are not your inferiors . If they believe they are , it 's because of the wrongs and humiliations you 've imposed on them for centuries . You men stick together . Why are we not to do the same ? If you start trade unions , why may not we ? As a matter of fact , as regards work , we 're your equals . We need our wages ; and to get hold of the jobs that we 're able to do we offer our work at a cheaper rate than you do . That is competition ; you must protect yourselves from it . If you want no more competition , keep your women at home and support them .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELEGATE</speaker>
       <p>But that 's precisely what we want : “ The man in the workshop , the woman in the home . ”</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . If the mother is not at home nowadays , it 's because the man is in the saloon .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELEGATE</speaker>
       <p>The men go to the saloons because they 're tired of finding the place badly kept and the supper not ready when they go home , and instead of a wife a tired-out factory hand .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . D'you think it 's to amuse themselves the women go to work ? Do n't you suppose they prefer a quiet life in their own homes ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELEGATE</speaker>
       <p>They 've only got to stay there .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . And who 's to support them ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELEGATE</speaker>
       <p>Their husbands !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . First they 've got to have husbands . What about the ones who have no husbands — the girls , the widows , the abandoned ? Is n't it better to give them a trade than to force them to take a lover ? Some of them want to leave off being obliged to beg for the help of a man . Ca n't you see that for a lot of women work means freedom ? Can you blame them for demanding the right to work ? That 's the victory they 're fighting for .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELEGATE</speaker>
       <p>I 'm not at all sure that that victory is a desirable one . Indeed , I 'm sure it is not . When you 've succeeded in giving the woman complete independence through hard work ; when you have taken her children from her and handed them over to a crèche ; when you 've severed her from her domestic duties and also from all domestic happiness and joy , how d'you know she wo n't turn round and demand to have her old slavery back again ? The quietness and peace of her own home ? The right to care for her own husband and nurse her own child ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . But can n't you see that it 's just that that the immense majority of women are demanding now ? We want the women to stay at home just as much as you do . But how are you going to make that possible ? At present the money spent on drink equals the total of the salaries paid to women . So the problem is to get rid of drunkenness . But the middle classes refuse to meet this evil straightforwardly because the votes which keep them in power are in the pockets of the publicans ; and you socialist leaders refuse just as much as the middle classes really to tackle the drink question because you 're as keen for votes as they are . You 've got to look the situation in the face . We 're on the threshold of a new era . In every civilized country , in the towns and in the rural districts , from the destitute and from the poor , from every home that a man has deserted for drink or left empty because men have no longer the courage to marry , a woman will appear , who comes out from that home and will sit down by your side in the workshop , in the factory , at the office , in the counting house . You do n't want her as housewife ; and as she refuses to be a prostitute , she will become a woman-worker , a competitor ; and finally , because she has more energy than you have , and because she is not a drunkard , she will take your places . DELEGATE [ brutally ] Well , before another hour 's gone over our heads you 'll find that she wo n't start that game here . Monsieur Féliat comes in . FÉLIAT [ to the delegate ] My dear sir , a thousand pardons for interrupting you , but as I 've just turned your friend out of my house because he took advantage of being in it to start a propaganda against me , what 's the use of your going on talking to this lady about a course of action she will no more consent to than I shall ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELEGATE</speaker>
       <p>Very well , Monsieur . I shall telephone to Paris for instructions . Probably you will refuse to let me use your instrument .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . I most certainly shall .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELEGATE</speaker>
       <p>So I shall go to the Post Office , and in ten minutes —</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Go , my dear sir , go . But let me tell you in a friendly way that it 'll take you more than ten minutes to get on to Paris .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELEGATE</speaker>
       <p>It takes you more , perhaps , but not me . Good-morning .<stage>The delegate goes out</stage>FÉLIAT<stage>to Thérèse</stage>The low brute ! Things are not going well . What happened at Duriot 's has made a very unfortunate impression here . The news that you were going to open a new workshop for the women has been twisted and distorted by gossip and chatter , and my men have been worked up by the other brute to come and threaten me .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . What d'you mean ?</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . They threaten me with a strike and with blacklisting me if I do n't give up the idea .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . You can n't give up absolutely certain profits .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . If I am too obstinate , it may result in much larger losses which will be equally certain .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . But what then ?</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . I 've had to promise that for the present at any rate there 's no question of taking on any more women .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Oh !</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . What could I do ? Monsieur Guéret comes in . FÉLIAT [ to Guéret ] Well ?</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . They would n't listen .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . I was afraid they would n't . [ To Thérèse ] That 's not all . Your godfather has been trying something else , and I understand he 's not succeeded . I shall have to take the mending away from your workshop .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . The women wo n't agree to that .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Perhaps that would be the best solution of the difficulty . THÉRÈSE [ startled ] Do n't say that . You can n't mean it . Think !</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . What 's more , the men refuse to finish the work the women have begun .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . We 'll finish it .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Then they 'll strike .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Let them strike . Monsieur Féliat , you can fight now and get terms for yourself . Just at this moment we have only one very urgent order . If the men strike , I can find you women to replace them . Every day I am refusing people who want to be taken on . GUÉRET [ suddenly ] I have an idea .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . What 's that ?</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . I know my men ; they 're not bad fellows .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . My workers are splendid women .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Of course they are . As a matter of fact we 're face to face now , not with a fight between men and masters , but with a fight between men-workers and women-workers . The men have their trade union , and the women have theirs . Both unions have a President and two Vice-Presidents . Both have their office . We must have a meeting between the two here at once , in a friendly , sensible way , before they 've all had time to excite themselves ; and let them find some way out that 'll please ‘ em all .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . But , my dear fellow , if you bring them together , they 'll tear one another 's eyes out .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Oh , we know you do n't believe the working classes have any sense . FÉLIAT [ between his teeth ] I do n't . I 've been an employer too long . THÉRÈSE [ to Monsieur Féliat ] Why not try what my godfather suggests ? What do you risk ?</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . I do n't mind . But I will have nothing to do with it personally .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Neither will I .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I 'll go and see if Berthe and Constance are here . [ To Guéret ] You go and fetch your men . [ She goes out to the left</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . I give you my word that , if there 's any possible way out , this is the only chance of getting at it .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Very well , go and fetch them . Guéret goes out . Thérèse comes in with Berthe and Constance . They are wearing large aprons and have scissors attached to their waistbelts . Berthe is a fat , ordinary woman . Constance is tall , dry , and ugly . BERTHE [ respectfully ] Good-morning , Monsieur Féliat . CONSTANCE [ the same ] Good-morning , Monsieur Féliat .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I want Berthe and Constance to tell you themselves whether you can count upon them in case of the men striking .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
       <p>Oh yes , Monsieur Féliat . We 'll do anything you want us to .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BERTHE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , Monsieur Féliat , do n't send us away ! CONSTANCE<stage>imploringly</stage>Oh , Monsieur Féliat , you wo n't send us away , will you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BERTHE</speaker>
       <p>We do want the work so , Monsieur .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
       <p>It 's God 's truth we do .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . I 'll do everything possible on my side , but it all depends on yourselves and the men . Try to come to some understanding .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , Monsieur . BERTHE<stage>lowering her voice</stage>If you can n't pay us quite as much for the mending , we do n't mind taking a little less . You 'd keep it dark , would n't you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . We 'll see about it . Girard , Charpin , Deschaume , and Vincent come in . WORKMEN [ very civil and speaking together ] Good-morning , ladies and gents .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Has my brother explained to you why he asked you to meet the representatives of the Women 's Union and to try to come to an understanding with them ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>Yes , Monsieur Féliat .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CHARPIN</speaker>
       <p>That 's all we want . All friends together , like .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DESCHAUME</speaker>
       <p>That 's the hammer , mate !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Then I 'll go . Do try and keep your tempers . ALL [ speaking together ] Oh yes . To be sure , sir . You need n't trouble , sir . Féliat goes out . The workmen and workwomen left together shake hands all round without any particular courtesy or cordiality .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CHARPIN</speaker>
       <p>Well , what d'you say to a sit down ? DESCHAUME<stage>speaking of Charpin</stage>That lazy swine 's only comfortable when he 's sittin ’ down .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CHARPIN</speaker>
       <p>I ai n't agoing to tire meself for nix , not ‘ arf ! Berthe and Constance have mechanically brought chairs for the workmen , who take them without any thanks , accustomed as they are to be waited upon .

      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>What 's the good of that ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DESCHAUME</speaker>
       <p>We 'd best have you , Girard . You 've education , and you 're up to all the dodges about public meetings .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>It 's not worth while .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DESCHAUME</speaker>
       <p>Well , I only put it forrard because it 's the usual . But have it your own way !<stage>A silence</stage>Only do n't all jaw at once . You 'll see you 'll want a chairman , I tell you that , but I do n't care . It ai n't my show .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CHARPIN</speaker>
       <p>Get a move on you , Girard , and speak up .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>Well , ladies — VINCENT<stage>interrupting</stage>Now look here . I want to get at an understandin ’ .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Monsieur Girard , will you be kind enough to speak for your friends ? We have nothing to say on our part . We 're asking for nothing .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>Well , that 's true . We want to have the mending back .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . And we do n't mean to give it up .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>Well , we expected that . Now , to show you that we 're not such a bad lot as you think , we 'll share it with you on two conditions . The first is that you 're paid the same wages as we are .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DESCHAUME</speaker>
       <p>Look here , that wo n't suit me at all , that wo n't . If my old woman gets as much as me , how am I to keep her under ? Blimey , she 'll think she 's my bloomin ’ equal ! GIRARD<stage>impatiently</stage>Oh , bung her into some other berth . Let me go on . The second condition is that you are n't to have a separate workshop . We 'll all work together as we used to .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Why ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DESCHAUME</speaker>
       <p>You women do a damned sight too much for your ha'pence .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>Yes , it 's all in the interests of the masters . It 's against solidarity .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Will you allow me to express my astonishment that you should make conditions with us when you wish to take something from us ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CHARPIN</speaker>
       <p>We 're ony tellin ’ you our terms for sharing the work with you .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . I quite understand ; but we have no desire to share it with you . We mean to keep it . And I 'm greatly surprised to hear you suggest that we should all work together .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
       <p>Indeed we wo n't .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DESCHAUME</speaker>
       <p>Why not , Mademoiselle ? When we worked together — CONSTANCE<stage>interrupting</stage>When we worked with you before , you played all sorts of dirty tricks on us to make us leave .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DESCHAUME</speaker>
       <p>What tricks ? Did you hear anything about that , Charpin ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CHARPIN</speaker>
       <p>I dunnow what she 's talkin ’ about . D'you Vincent ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>VINCENT</speaker>
       <p>Look here , I only want to get to an understandin ’ .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
       <p>You never stopped sayin ’ beastly things . DESCHAUME AND CHARPIN<stage>protesting together</stage>Oh ! O-ho !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DESCHAUME</speaker>
       <p>Well , if we can n't have a bit of chippin ’ in a friendly way like !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BERTHE</speaker>
       <p>Beastly things like that ai n't jokes . I did n't know where to look meself ; and I 've sat for a sculptor , so I ai n't too particular .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CHARPIN</speaker>
       <p>He ! He ! I thought she was talkin ’ about that old joke of the rats . The men laugh together .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes , you 're laughing about it still ! About shutting up live rats in our desks before we came to work .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>He ! He ! We did n't mean any harm .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . You did n't mean any harm ! The little apprentice was ill for a week , and Madame Dumont had a bad fall . You thought of dozens of things of that kind , like the typists who mixed up all the letters on the women 's desks . When we went away to get our lunch , you came and spoilt our work and made the women lose a great part of their day 's pay or work hours of overtime . We do n't want any more of that . You agreed we should have a separate workshop . We 'll keep it .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>If Monsieur Féliat sticks to you , we 'll have to come out on strike .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . We do n't want Monsieur Féliat to get into trouble because of us .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>Well , what are you going to do about it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . We 'll take your places . CHARPIN [ bringing his fist down with a bang upon the table ] Well , I 'm damned ! DESCHAUME [ threateningly ] If you do , we 'll have to put you through it !</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
       <p>We 'll do it ! GIRARD<stage>to Thérèse</stage>D'you understand now , Mademoiselle , why we socialists do n't want women in the factory or in the workshop ? The woman 's the devil because of the low salary she has to take . She 's a victim , and she likes to be a victim , and so she 's the best card the employer has to play against a strike . The women are too weak , and if I might say so , too slavish —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DESCHAUME</speaker>
       <p>Yes , that 's the word , mate , slavish . BERTHE<stage>very angry</stage>Look at that man there , my husband , and hear what he 's saying before me , his wife , that he makes obey him like a dog . He beats me , he does . You do n't trouble about my being what you call slavish when it 's you that profits by it ! I 'd like to know who taught women to be slavish but husbands like you .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . You 've so impressed it upon women that they 're inferior to men , that they 've ended by believing it .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>Well , maybe there 's exceptions , but it 's true in the main .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DESCHAUME</speaker>
       <p>Let ‘ em stay at home , I says , and cook the bloomin ’ dinner .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BERTHE</speaker>
       <p>And what 'll they cook the days when you spend all your wages in booze .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>It 's the people that started you working that you ought to curse .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BERTHE</speaker>
       <p>I like that ! It was my husband himself that brought me to the workshop .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . She 's not the only one , eh , Vincent ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>VINCENT</speaker>
       <p>But I ai n't sayin ’ nothin ’ , I ai n't . What are you turnin ’ on me for ? I ai n't sayin ’ nothin ’ .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BERTHE</speaker>
       <p>We 'd like nothing better than to stay at home . Why do n't you support us there ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
       <p>It 's because you do n't support us there that you 've got to let us work .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DESCHAUME</speaker>
       <p>We ai n't going to .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BERTHE</speaker>
       <p>We wo n't give in to you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>If you do n't , we 'll turn the job in .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . And I tell you that we shall take your places .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DESCHAUME</speaker>
       <p>Rats ! You can n't do it .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . We could n't at one time , that 's true . But now we 've got the machines . The machines drove the women from their homes . Up to lately one had to have a man 's strength for the work ; now , by just pulling a lever , a woman can do as much and more than the strongest man . The machines revenge us .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DESCHAUME</speaker>
       <p>We 'll smash the things .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>She 's right . By God , she 's right ! It 's them machines has done it . If any one had told my grandfather a time would come when one chap could keep thousands of spindles running and make hundreds of pairs of stockings in a day , and yards and yards of woollen stuff , and socks and shirts and all , why grandfather 'd 've thought everybody 'd have shirts and socks and comforters and shoes , and there 'd be no more hard work and empty bellies . Curse the damned things ! We works longer hours , and there 's just as many bare feet and poor devils shivering for want of clothes . The machines were to give us everything , blast ‘ em ! The workers are rotten fools ! The damned machines have made nothing but hate between them that own them and them that work them . They 've used up the women and even the children ; and it 's all to sell the things they make to niggers or Chinamen ; and maybe we 'll have war about it . They 've made the middle classes rich , and they 're the starvation of all of us ; and after they 've done all that , here are the women , our own women , want to help ‘ em to best us !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MOTHER BOUGNE</speaker>
       <p>You 're right , Girard . When I was a kid , and there was no machines — leastways , not to speak of — we was all better off . Women stayed at home , and they 'd got enough to do . Why , my old grandmother used to fetch water from the well and be out pickin ’ up sticks before it was light of a mornin ’ ! Yes , and women made their own bread , and did their washin ’ , and made their bits of things themselves ! Now it 's machines for everythin ’ , and they say to us : “ Come into the factory and you 'll earn big money . ” And we come , like silly kids ! Why , fancy me , eight years old , taken out of the village and bunged into a spinnin ’ mill ! Then , when I was married , there was me in a workman 's dwellin ’ . You turn a tap for your water , do n't fetch it ; baker 's bread , and your bit of dinner from the cookshop , or preserved meat out of a tin . You do n't make a fire , you turn on the gas ; your stockin 's and togs all fetched out of a shop . There ai n't no need for the women to stay at home no longer , so they cuts down the men 's wages and puts us in the factories . We ai n't got time to suckle our kids ; and now they do n't want young ‘ uns any more ! But when you 're in the factory , they make yer pay through the nose for yer gas and yer water , and baker 's bread and ready-made togs ; and you 've got nothin ’ left out of yer bit of wages , and you 're as poor as ever ; and you 're only a “ hand ” at machines in the damp and smoke , instead of bein ’ in your own house an ’ decent like . What are you fussin ’ about , Girard ? Do n't you see that we can n't go back to the old times now ? A woman ai n't got a house now , only a little room with nothin ’ but a dirty bed to sleep on ! And I tell you , Girard , you 've got to let us earn our livin ’ like that now , because it 's you and the likes of you that 's brought us to it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>Well , after all , we 've got to look after our living . The women want to take it from us .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MOTHER BOUGNE</speaker>
       <p>It 's because they have n't got any themselves , my lad . They 've got to live as well as you , you see .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>And supposing there is n't enough living for everybody ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MOTHER BOUGNE</speaker>
       <p>The strongest 'll get it and the weak ‘ uns 'll be done in .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>Well , we 've not made the world , and we 're not going to have our work taken away from us .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
       <p>And we 're not , either .</p>

       <p>Well , we 've got to live too . The kids has got to live and we 've got to live . One would think we was brute beasts .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
       <p>We say just the same as you . We 've not made the world , it ai n't our fault . During the last few speeches women have appeared at the door to the right and have remained on the threshold , becoming excited by the conversation . A WOMAN<stage>at the door</stage>It ai n't our fault . Some men show themselves at the door at the back .</p>

To protect the right to work . Send for ‘ em . GIRARD<stage>to Monsieur Féliat</stage>If ‘ t was to bully us , you 'd have sent for ‘ em long ago . What are you waiting for ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . I 'm waiting till you kindly allow me to speak . I can n't believe my ears . Is it you , Girard , and you , Deschaume , who want to have the police sent for to save you from a pack of women ? Ha ! Ha !</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CHARPIN</speaker>
       <p>Oh , it makes you laugh , does it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>You defend the cats because they 're against us . Well , we wo n't have it . Duriot 's men came out —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CHARPIN</speaker>
       <p>Yes , and we 'll do the same .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DESCHAUME</speaker>
       <p>We will . Look out for the strike !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>We 're agreed ; ai n't we , mates ? CHARPIN AND DESCHAUME<stage>together</stage>Yes , yes . We 'll strike . Let 's strike .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . You do n't really mean that you 're going on strike ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>Do n't we , though !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . How can you ? I 've given everything you 've asked for . CHARPIN [ growling ] That 's just the reason .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>If you 've given in , that shows we were right . You 'll have to give in some more .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Good God , what d'you want now ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CHARPIN</speaker>
       <p>We want you to sack all the women .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DESCHAUME</speaker>
       <p>No we do n't . We want you to sack Mademoiselle Thérèse .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . You 're mad ! What harm has she done you ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>The harm she 's done us ? Well , she 's on your side .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DESCHAUME</speaker>
       <p>She 's turned the women 's heads . They want to take our places .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CHARPIN</speaker>
       <p>And we wo n't have it .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Come ! Be reasonable . You can n't ask me that .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>We do ask you that .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . It will upset my whole business .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CHARPIN</speaker>
       <p>What 's that to us ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Well , I must have time to think about it .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>There 's nothing to think about . Sack the Paris woman or we go on strike .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . You can n't put a pistol to my head like this . I 've got orders in hand .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>What 's that to us ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Well then , I wo n't give in this time . You demanded that I should not open a new workshop . I gave in . I wo n't go further than that .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>Then out we go .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Well go , and be damned to you . [ Pause ] The women will take your places .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>You think so , do you ? You think it 's as easy as that . Well , try . Just you try to fill up our places . Have you forgot there 's two delegates here from the Central Committee ? A phone to Paris and your bally show is done for .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . It 's damnable .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>And if that does n't choke you off , there 's other things .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CHARPIN</speaker>
       <p>We 'll set the whole bloomin ’ place on fire .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>Do n't you try to bully us .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Well , look here . We wo n't quarrel . I 'll send away Mademoiselle Thérèse . But give me a little time to settle things up .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CHARPIN</speaker>
       <p>No ; out she goes .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Give me a month . I ask only a month .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>An hour , that 's all you 'll get , an hour .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>CHARPIN</speaker>
       <p>An hour , not more .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GIRARD</speaker>
       <p>We 're going off to meet the delegates at the Hotel de la Poste ; you can send your answer there . The Parisian goes out sharp now , or else look out for trouble . Come on , boys , let 's go and tell the others . There 's nothing more to do here .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . But stop , listen — CHARPIN [ to Féliat ] That 's our last word . [ To the others ] Hurry on . The workmen go out . Thérèse has come in a moment before and is standing on the threshold . FÉLIAT [ to Thérèse ] How much did you hear ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Oh , please , please , do n't give in . Do n't abandon these women . It 's dreadful in the workroom . They 're in despair . I 've just been with them , talking to them . They get desperate when they think of their children .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . The men are not asking me now to get rid of them . What they 're asking for is the break-up of your Union , and that you yourself should go .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Oh , they say that now . But if you give in , they 'll see that they can get anything they like from your weakness , and they 'll make you turn out all these wretched women .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . But I can n't help myself ! You did n't hear the brutal threats of these men . If I do n't give in , I shall be blacklisted , and they 'll set the place on fire ; they said so . Where will your women 's work be then ? And I shall be ruined .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Then you mean to give in without a struggle ?</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Would you like to take the responsibility for what will happen if I resist ? There 'll be violence . Just think what it 'll mean . In the state the men are in anything may happen . There 's a wounded man already . How many would there be to-morrow ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . You think only of being beaten . But suppose you win ? Suppose you act energetically and get the best of it .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . My energy would be my ruin . THÉRÈSE [ with a change of tone ] Then you wish me to go ?</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . I have only made up my mind to it to prevent something worse . THÉRÈSE [ very much moved ] It 's impossible you can sacrifice me in this way at the first threat . Look here , Monsieur Féliat ; perhaps it does n't come very well from me , but I can n't help reminding you that you 've said repeatedly yourself that I 've been extremely useful to you . Do n't throw me overboard without making one try to save me .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . It would be no use .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . How can you tell ? It 's your own interest to keep me . The delegate said that if I go they 'll break up the Women 's Union and make the women take the same wages as the men .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . They wo n't do that because they know I would n't keep them .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . You see ! If you give in , it means the break-up of the whole thing and the loss to you of the saving I 've made for you . And you have obligations to these women who have been working for you for years .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . If I have to part with them , I will see they are provided for .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes , for a day — a week , perhaps . But afterwards ? What then ? Little children will be holding out their hands for food to mothers who have none to give them .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . But , good God , what have I to do with that ? Is it my fault ? Do n't you see that I 'm quite powerless in the matter ?</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . No , you 're not quite powerless . You can choose which you will sacrifice , the women who have been perfectly loyal to you , or the men who want to wring from your weakness freedom from competition which frightens them .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . They 're fighting for their daily bread .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes , fighting the woman because she works for lower wages . She can do that because she is sober and self-controlled . Is it because of her virtues that you condemn her ?</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . I know all that as well as you do , and I tell you again the women can go on working just as they were working before you came .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . You 'll be made to part with them .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . We shall see . But at present that 's not the question . The present thing is about you . One of us has to be sacrificed , you or me . I can see only one thing . If I stick to you , my machinery will be smashed and my works will be burned . I 'm deeply sorry this has happened , and I do n't deny for a moment the great value of your services ; but , after all , I can n't ruin myself for your sake . THÉRÈSE [ urgently ] But you would n't be ruined . Defend yourself , take measures . Ask for assistance from the Government .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . The Government can n't prevent the strike .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . But the women will do the work .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . You think of nothing but your women . And the men ? They 'll be starving , wo n't they ? And their women and their children will starve with them . THÉRÈSE [ almost in tears ] And me , you have no pity for me . What 's to become of me ? If you abandon me , I 'm done for . I 'd made a career for myself . I had realized my dreams . I was doing a little good . And I was so deeply grateful to you for giving me my chance . I 'm all alone in the world , you know that very well . Before I came here I tried every possible way to earn my living . Oh , please do n't send me away . Do n't drive me back into that . Try once again , do something . Let me speak to the men . It 's all my life that 's at stake . If you drive me out , I do n't know where to go to . Monsieur Guéret comes in . GUÉRET [ greatly excited ] Féliat , we must n't wait a moment ; we must give in at once . They 're exciting themselves ; they 're mad ; they 're getting worse ; they may do anything . They 've gone to the women 's workroom and they 're driving them out . From the adjoining workshop there comes a crash of glass and the sound of women screaming . THÉRÈSE [ desperately ] Go , Monsieur ! Go quickly ! Do n't let anything dreadful happen . You 're right . I 'll leave at once . Go ! Monsieur Guéret and Monsieur Féliat rush into the women 's workshop . The noise increases ; there is a sound of furniture overthrown and the loud screams of women . THÉRÈSE [ alone , clasping her hands ] Oh , God ! Oh , God ! Thérèse stands as if hypnotized by terror , her eyes wide open and fixed upon the door of the workshop . The noise still increases ; there is a revolver shot , then a silence . Finally the voice of Monsieur Féliat is heard speaking , though the words are not intelligible , and a shout of men 's voices . Then Monsieur Guéret comes in very pale .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Do n't be frightened , it 's all over . The shot was fired in the air . The men have gone out ; there are only the women now — crying in the workshop .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Are you sure nobody is killed ? Is it true , oh , tell me , is it really true ? Monsieur Féliat comes in .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Poor Thérèse ! Do n't be frightened .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Oh , those screams ! Those dreadful screams ! Is it true , really , nobody was hurt ?</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Nobody , I assure you .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . The shot ?</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . Fired in the air , to frighten the women . The men broke in the door , and upset a bench , and made a great row . I got there just in time . As soon as they were promised what they want they were quiet . THÉRÈSE [ after a pause , slowly ] They were promised what they want . So it 's done . [ A silence ] Then there 's nothing left for me but to go .</stage>
      <stage>GUÉRET . Where are you going to ?</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . You need n't go at once .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . Yes , I 'm going at once . [ A silence ] I 'm going where I 'm forced to go .</stage>
      <stage>FÉLIAT . You can leave to-morrow or the day after .</stage>
      <stage>THÉRÈSE . No , I leave by train , this evening , for Paris .</stage>

       <stage>SCENE :— The first inner court of the house of Rheou . At the back between two lofty pylons the entrance leading up from below . Through the columns supporting the hanging garden which stretches across the back can be seen the Nile . A high terrace occupies the left of the scene . Steps lead up to it , and from there to the hanging garden . Along the side of the terrace a small delicately carved wooden statue of Isis stands on a sacrificial table . On the right is the peristyle leading to the inner dwelling of Akhounti . The bases of the columns are in the form of lotus buds , the shafts like lotus stems , the capitals full blown flowers . In the spaces between the columns are wooden statues of the gods .</stage>
       <stage>Delethi is playing a harp . Nagaou dances before her . Nahasi is juggling with oranges , while Mouene sits watching a little bird in a cage . Yaouma reclines on the terrace supporting her head on her elbows and gazing out at the Nile . Zaya is beside her . On a carpet Sitsinit , lying flat upon her stomach with a writing box by her side , is busy painting an ibis on the left hand of Hanou , who lies in a similar attitude .</stage>
      </stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SITSI</speaker>
       <p>Did you not know ? She , on whose left hand a black ibis has been painted , is certain of a happy day .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HANOU</speaker>
       <p>A happy day ! Why then , ‘ tis I , perhaps , who will be chosen to-night ! DELETHI<stage>playing the harp while Nagaou dances before her</stage>More slowly !— more slowly !... you must make them think of the swaying of a lotus flower , that the Nile 's slow-moving current would bear away , and that raises itself to kiss again the waters of the stream .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NAGAOU</speaker>
       <p>Yes , yes .... Begin again ! NAHASI<stage>juggling with oranges</stage>Nagaou would let herself be borne away without a struggle .<stage>She laughs</stage>MOUENE<stage>hopping on one foot</stage>We know that she goes to the bank of the Nile , at the hour when the palm-trees grow black against the evening sky , to listen to a basket maker 's songs . HANOU<stage>to Sitsinit</stage>And this morning I anointed my whole body with Kyphli , mixed with cinnamon and terrabine and myrrh . DELETHI<stage>to Nagaou</stage>‘ Tis well ... you may dance the great prayer to Isis with the rest . NAGAOU<stage>to Mouene</stage>Yes ! I do go to listen to songs at dark . You are still too little for anyone , basket maker or any other , to take notice of you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MOUENE</speaker>
       <p>You think so !... who gave me this little bird ?<stage>She draws the bird from the cage by a string attached to its leg</stage>Who caught thee , flower-of-the-air , who gave thee to me ?<stage>Holding up a finger</stage>Do not tell ! Do not tell .... HANOU<stage>looking at herself in a metal mirror</stage>Sitsinit ... the black line that lengthens this eye is too short ... make it longer with your reed . I think the more beautiful I am , the more chance I shall have to be chosen for the sacrifice .... Is it not so , Zaya ?... What are you doing there without a word ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZAYA</speaker>
       <p>I was watching the flight of a crane with hanging feet , that melted away in the distant blue of heaven .... Do not hope to be chosen by the gods , Hanou .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HANOU</speaker>
       <p>Wherefore should I not be chosen ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZAYA</speaker>
       <p>Neither you nor any who are here . The gods never demand the sacrifice two years together from the same village .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HANOU</speaker>
       <p>Never ?</p>
      </sp>

       <speaker>ZAYA</speaker>
       <p>Rarely .</p>

       <p>I know not .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SITSI</speaker>
       <p>Would it not make you proud ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NAGAOU</speaker>
       <p>Yes . But it makes me proud , too , to lean on the breast of him whose words still the beating of my heart .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELETHI</speaker>
       <p>To be taken by a god ! By the Nile !</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>DELETHI</speaker>
       <p>Yes , but one must leave the country , then .... None of the daughters of Haka-Phtah could bring themselves to that . A pause . YAOUMA<stage>to herself</stage>Perhaps !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NAHASI</speaker>
       <p>What do you say , Yaouma ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>

       <p>Nothing . I was speaking to my soul .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>MOUENE</speaker>
       <p>Yaouma 's eyes weep for weariness because they watch far off for him , who comes not .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>Peace , child . ZAYA<stage>to Delethi</stage>One thing is certain , someone must go upon the sacred barge ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELETHI</speaker>
       <p>Without the sacrifice the Nile would not overflow , and all the land would remain barren .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HANOU</speaker>
       <p>And the corn would not sprout , nor the beans , nor the maize , nor the lotus .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELETHI</speaker>
       <p>And all the people would perish miserably .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HANOU</speaker>
       <p>So that she who dies , sacrificed to the Nile , saves the lives of a whole people . That is a better thing , Nagaou , than to make one man 's happiness . A pause . YAOUMA<stage>to herself</stage>Perhaps .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HANOU</speaker>
       <p>And on the appointed day one is borne from the house of the god to the Nile , surrounded by all the dwellers in the town .... The Pharaoh — health and strength be unto him !...</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELETHI</speaker>
       <p>You do not know , Hanou , you tell us what you do not know .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HANOU</speaker>
       <p>But it is so , is it not , Zaya ? Zaya knows about the ceremony , because last year it was her sister who was chosen .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MOUENE</speaker>
       <p>Tell us , Zaya .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NAHASI</speaker>
       <p>Yes , tell us the manner of it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZAYA</speaker>
       <p>On the fifth day of the month of Paophi ....</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MOUENE</speaker>
       <p>To-day — that is to-day ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NAHASI</speaker>
       <p>Yes . What will happen .... The prayer of Isis .... But afterwards ? Before ? They gather round Zaya .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZAYA</speaker>
       <p>Before the sun has ended his day 's journey , the people , summoned to the terraces by a call from the Temple , will intone the great hymn to Isis , which is sung but once a year . Within the house of the god the assembled priests will await the sign that shall reveal the virgin to be offered to the Nile to obtain its yearly flood . The name of the chosen will be cried from the doorway on high , caught up by those who hear it first , cried out to others , who in turn will cry it running towards the house that Ammon has favored with his choice . Then shall the happy victim of the year stand forth alone , amid her kinsfolk bowed before her , and to her ears shall rise the shoutings of the multitude .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ALL</speaker>
       <p>Oh !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELETHI</speaker>
       <p>And after a month of purification she will be borne to the house of the god !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZAYA</speaker>
       <p>And on the day of Prodigies ....</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NAHASI</speaker>
       <p>Oh , the day of Prodigies !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZAYA</speaker>
       <p>She will be the foremost nearer to the Sanctuary than all the rest . She will pray with the praying crowd , she will behold the lowering of the stone that hides the face of Isis ....</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELETHI</speaker>
       <p>She will behold Isis — face to face ....</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ALL</speaker>
       <p>Oh !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZAYA</speaker>
       <p>She will beg the goddess graciously to incline her head , in sign that , yet another year , Egypt shall be protected . And when the fervor of the crowd 's united prayer is great enough , the head of the Goddess of Stone will bow . That will be the first prodigy .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELETHI</speaker>
       <p>The head of the Goddess of Stone will bow — that will be the first prodigy .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZAYA</speaker>
       <p>And in the crowd there will be blind who shall see , and deaf who shall hear , and dumb who shall speak .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELETHI</speaker>
       <p>Perhaps Mieris , our good mistress , will be cured of her blindness at last .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HANOU</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>And when she who is chosen goes forth from the house of the</l>
        <l>God .... Tell us , Zaya , tell us the manner of her going forth .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZAYA</speaker>
       <p>Three days before the appointed day , in the town and throughout the land , they will begin the preparations for the festival . When the moment comes , the crowd will surge before the temple , guarded by Lybian soldiers . And she , she , the elect , the saviour , will come forth , ringed by the high priests of Ammon in purple and in gold , and aloft on a chariot where perfumes burn , deafened by sound of trumpet and cries of joy , she will behold the people stretch unnumbered arms to her ....</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ALL</speaker>
       <p>Oh !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELETHI</speaker>
       <p>And she will be borne to the Nile ....</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZAYA</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>And she will be borne to the Nile . She will board the barge of</l>
        <l>Ammon ....</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELETHI</speaker>
       <p>And the barge will glide from the bank ....</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZAYA</speaker>
       <p>And the barge will glide from the bank where all the crowd will bow their faces to the dust .<stage>She stops , greatly moved</stage>And when the barge returns she will be gone . ALL<stage>in low tones</stage>And when the barge returns she will be gone .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZAYA</speaker>
       <p>And after two days the waters of the Nile will rise .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ALL</speaker>
       <p>The waters of the Nile will rise ....</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELETHI</speaker>
       <p>And as far as the waters flow they will speak her name , who made the sacrifice , with blessings and with tears .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HANOU</speaker>
       <p>If it were I !... ALL<stage>save Yaouma</stage>If it were I !... Yaouma rises to a sitting posture .</p>

       <p>If it were you , Yaouma ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>Perhaps I should refuse .</p>

       <p>Oh ! MOUENE<stage>mischievously</stage>I know why ! I know why !</p>

       <p>We know why .</p>

       <speaker>MOUENE</speaker>
       <p>She watches for the coming of the galley with twenty oars , bearing the travellers from the North . There is a young priest among them , the potter 's son .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELETHI</speaker>
       <p>A young priest , the potter 's son , who went away two years ago .</p>

       <p>But you know what they say ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ZAYA</speaker>
       <p>They say that on the same boat there comes a scribe who preaches of new gods ....</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>I know .</p>

        <l>The priests will stop the boat , and eight days hence , perhaps ,</l>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>I shall wait . The Steward enters and whispers to Delethi .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELETHI</speaker>
       <p>The mistress sends word the hour is come to go indoors . They go out L , Sitsinit picking up the writing box , Nahasi juggling with oranges , Mouene carrying her cage and dancing about , Delethi plays her harp singing with Hanou and Nagaou . Black is the hair of my love , More black than the brows of the night , Than the fruit of the plum tree . The Steward , who had gone out , returns at once , whip in hand , followed by a poor old man , half naked , and covered with mud , who carries a hod . STEWARD<stage>stopping before the statue of Thoueris</stage>There . Draw near , potter , and look . By some mischance , the horn and the plume of Goddess Thoueris have been broken . The master must not see them when he comes back for the feast of the Nomination . There is the horn — there is the plume . Replace them . PAKH<stage>with terror</stage>I — must I ... to-day when my son is coming home ?</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAKH</speaker>
       <p>I did not know that I must lay hands on the Goddess Thoueris .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>Obey . PAKH<stage>throwing himself on his knees</stage>I pray you ! I pray you ... I should never dare . And then ... my son ... my son who is coming back from a long , long journey ....</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>You shall have twenty blows of the stick for having tired my tongue . If you refuse to obey me you shall have two hundred .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAKH</speaker>
       <p>I pray you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>Bid Sokiti help you . He goes out at the back ; as he passes he gives Sokiti a blow with his whip , making a sign to him to go and join Pakh . Sokiti obeys without manifesting sorrow or surprise .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAKH</speaker>
       <p>He says we must lift down the Goddess . SOKITI . I ?</p>

       <p>You and I . SOKITI<stage>beginning to tremble . After a pause</stage>I am afraid .</p>

       <speaker>PAKH</speaker>
       <p>I too — I am afraid .</p>

       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>If you touch her you die .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAKH</speaker>
       <p>You will die of the stick if you do not obey .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>Why cannot they leave me at my work . I was happy .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAKH</speaker>
       <p>We must — we must tell her that it is in order to repair her crown .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>Yes . We must let her know . They prostrate themselves before the goddess .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAKH</speaker>
       <p>Oh , Mighty One !— thou who hast given birth to the gods , pardon if our miserable hands dare to touch thee ! Thy horn and thy right plume have fallen off . ‘ Tis to replace them .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>We are forced to obey — O breath divine — creator of the universe .... It is to mend thee . PAKH<stage>rising , to Sokiti</stage>Come ! Bitiou , the dwarf , enters ; he is a poor deformed creature . When he sees Pakh and Sokiti touching the statue , he tries to run away . He falls , picks himself up , and hides in a corner . By degrees he watches and draws near during what follows . Pakh and Sokiti take the statue from its pedestal and set it upright on the ground .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>She has not said anything .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAKH</speaker>
       <p>She must be laid on her belly .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>Gently .... They lay her flat . PAKH<stage>giving him the horn</stage>Hold that .<stage>He goes to his hod , takes a handful of cement , and proceeds to mend the statue</stage>Here ... the plume ... so ... there ... we must let her dry . In the meantime let us go look upon the Nile ; we may see the boat that brings my son .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>You will not see him .</p>

       <p>I shall not see him ?</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAKH</speaker>
       <p>He will come here ... because he would see his father and mother once more .</p>

       <p>There is nothing in sight .</p>

       <p>No ....<stage>suddenly</stage>You saw the crocodile ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>Yes .... There is a woman going to the Nile with her pitcher on her head .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAKH</speaker>
       <p>That is my wife , that is Kirjipa , that is mine . She seeks with her eyes the boat that bears her son — Satni .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>She is going into the stream .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>PAKH</speaker>
       <p>How else can she draw clear water ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>But at the very spot where the crocodile plunged .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAKH</speaker>
       <p>What matter ? She wears the feather of an ibis ... and I know a magic spell .<stage>He begins to chant</stage>Back , son of Sitou ! Dare not ! Seize not ! Open not thy jaws ! Let the water become a sheet of flame before thee ! The spell of thirty-seven gods is in thine eye . Thou art bound , thou art bound ! Stay , son of Sitou ! Ammon , spouse of thy mother , protect her ! SOKITI<stage>without surprise</stage>It is gone . PAKH<stage>without surprise</stage>It could not do otherwise . Bitiou , now close to the statue , touches it furtively with a finger tip , then runs , falls , and picks himself up . He comes up to Pakh and Sokiti . SOKITI<stage>pointing to the statue</stage>She is dry now , perhaps ?</p>
      </sp>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAKH</speaker>
       <p>So am I , but come and help me . They replace the statue on its pedestal , then step back to look at it .</p>

       <p>She has done us no harm .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>PAKH</speaker>
       <p>I see him ... the pivot of the gate of Amenti set upon his eye , turns upon his right eye , and turns on that eye whether in opening or in shutting , and his mouth utters loud cries . SOKITI<stage>doubling up with delight</stage>And he who ate so much !... He who ate so much ! He will have his food , bread and water , hung above his head , and he will leap to get it down , whilst others will dig holes beneath his feet to prevent his touching it .</p>

I know thy face , and I can guess thy smile .<stage>She takes some of the flowers which she has laid beside her and lays them one by one on the pedestal of the statue</stage>Behold my daily offering ! I know this for a white lotus flower . It is for thee . I am not wrong , this one , longer , and with the heavier scent , is the pink lotus . It is for thee . And here are yet two more of these sacred flowers . At dawn , they come from out the water , little by little . At midday they open wide . And when the sun sinks they , too , hide themselves , letting the waters of the Nile cover them like a veil . Men say they are fair to see . Alas , I know not the beauty of the gifts I bring ! Here is a typha ... here an alisma ; and by the overpowering perfume , this , I know , is the acacia flower . I have had them tell me how the light , playing through the filmy petals , tints them with color sweet unto the eyes . May the sight gladden thine ! I know not the beauty of the gifts I bring ! But all the days of my life , a suppliant I shall come , and weary not to ply thee with my prayers , until in the end thou absolve me , until thou grant me the boon that all save I enjoy , to behold the rays of the shining God , of Ammon-Ra , the Sun divine . O Isis , remember the cruel blow that did befall me ! I had a little child . Unto him sight was given , and when he first could speak , it was life 's sweetest joy , to hear him tell the color and the form of things . He is dead , Isis ! And I have never seen him — Take thou my tears and my prayer , bid this perpetual night , wherein I scarce can breathe , to cease — And if thou wilt not , deliver me to death — She-who-loves-the-silence , and after the judgment I may go to Amenti , and find my well-beloved child — find him , and there at last behold his face . Isis , I give thee all these flowers .<stage>She rises</stage>Come , Yaouma .<stage>As she is about to go , she stops , suddenly radiant</stage>Stay — I hear — yes ! Go , bring the ewer and the lustral water . It is the master — He is here . Yaouma goes out , but returns quickly . Enter Rheou .</p>

       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>I die to bring the flooding of the Nile — to make fertile all the Egyptian fields . If I answer not to the voices that call me , my name will be a byword wherever the rays of the sun-God fall . Another than I will go clothed in the dazzling robe . Another will hear the shouting of the multitude . Another will be given to the Nile .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Another will die , and you , you will live , for your own joy and for mine .</p>

       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Light the world with your beauty . Live , Yaouma , live with me ! Bright shall your breast be with the flower of the persea , and your tresses anointed heavy with sweet odor .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>The waves of the Nile will be my head-dress . Oh ! fair green robe , with flowers yet more fair .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Yaouma , you loved me —<stage>She bends her head</stage>Remember , remember my going away , but two years since , how you did weep when I embarked . You ran by the bank , you followed the boat that bore me . I see you still , the slim form , the swift lank limbs ; I can hear still the sound of your little naked feet upon the sand . And when the boat grounded — do you remember ? For hours the oarsmen pushed with long poles , singing the while , and you clapping your hands and crying out my name . And when at length we floated , there was laughter and cries of joy — but you , you did stand all on a sudden still , and I knew then that you wept . You climbed to a hillock , and you waved your arms , you grew smaller , smaller , smaller , till we turned by a cluster of palms . Oh , how you promised to wait for me !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>Have I not waited ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>We had chosen the place to build our home . Do you remember ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>Yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>And dreamed of nights when you should sleep with your head upon my breast —<stage>Yaouma bends her head</stage>And now you seek a grave in the slime of the river . YAOUMA<stage>with fervor</stage>The slime of the river is holy , the river is holy . The Nile is nine times holy . It makes grow the pasture that feeds our flocks . It drinks the tears of all our eyes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Listen , Yaouma , I will reveal the truth to you . The Gods who claim your sacrifice — the Gods are false .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>The Gods are true —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>They are powerless .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>It is their power that subdues me — it is stronger than love . Until to-day I loved you more than all the living things upon the earth — the breath of your mouth alone gave life to my heart . Even this very day , I dreaded being chosen of the Gods . But now , who has so utterly transformed me if it be not the Gods ? You are to me as nothing , now . And I who trembled at a scorpion , who wept at the pricking of a thorn , I am all joy at the thought of dying soon . How could this be if the Gods had not willed it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Hear me a little — and I can prove to you —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>

      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>Ah ! Ah ! I will prove you mad — you say there is no hell — But we know , we know that it exists , look there !<stage>Pointing to the sunset</stage>When the sun grows red at evening , is it not because the glow of hell is thrown upon it from below ? You have but to open your eyes .<stage>Laughing</stage>The Gods not exist !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>They do not . In the sanctuaries of our temples is nothing save beasts , unclean , absurd , and lifeless images ; believe me , Yaouma — I love you — I will not see you die . Your sacrifice is useless . Not because you are offered up will the waters of the Nile rise ! Refuse , hide yourself , the waters will still rise . Ah , to lose you for a lie ! To lose you — you ! How can I convince you ?— I know ! Yaouma , you saw me cross the dead scarabs on my path . And yet I live ! Oh ! it angers me to see my words move you not . Your reason , your reason ! Awaken your reason —</p>
      </sp>

      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>I do not understand it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>Nor I , for I know that a certain number of the soldiers have refused to renew the attempt of yesterday —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>They have refused ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>Yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>What did they say ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>That they were afraid .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>Of what — of whom ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>Of Satni .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>Of Satni ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>Yes . They say it was he who caused the miracle of yesterday .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>What — what do they say ? Their words — tell me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>That it was he —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>He , Satni ?—</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>Yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>Who caused the miracle of yesterday ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>Yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>The miracle that prevented them from carrying out the order of the High Priest ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>Yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>The order to come here and seize Yaouma ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>Yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>So that is what they say ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>Every one says it . RHEOU<stage>after some reflection</stage>Come , it is time you learned the truth , that you may repeat it all . In the countries whither he went Satni learned many things — great things . Come hither , lend your ear . He declares there be other gods than the gods of Egypt — and more powerful . If you remember , my father and the Pharaoh Amenotep likewise declared this , and would have made these gods known to us . How they were frustrated you know . It seems — for my own part I know not , ‘ tis Satni says so , ceaselessly , these two months since his return — it seems then , the time is come when these Gods would make them known to us . They have endowed Satni with superhuman power . That I know , and none may doubt it now . Satni is resolved to keep his betrothed , and the Lybian Guards were not deceived , it was he who yesterday called down the thunder and the floods from Heaven upon the soldiers sent here to seize Yaouma .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>The oldest remember but one such prodigy .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>What I have told you , tell to all ; and this , besides , say to them : each time that any would cross the will of Satni — they who dare the attempt will be scattered , even as the guards were scattered yesterday . Add this , that Satni is guided by the spirit of the dead Pharaoh , that I last night beheld my father 's spirit , and that great events will come to pass in Egypt .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>I shall tell them .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Behold , the envoy of the new gods ! Leave me to speak with him .</l>
        <l>Go , repeat my words .</l>
        <l>The Steward goes out .</l>
        <l>Satni enters from the back . Rheou prostrates himself before</l>
        <l>Satni .</l>
        <l>SATNI</l>
        <stage>looking behind him</stage>
        <l>Before which God do you still bow down ?</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>Before you . If you be not a God , you are the spirit of a God .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>I do not understand your words .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>Who can call down thunderbolts from heaven , unless he be an envoy of the Gods ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>I am no —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>‘ Tis well , ‘ tis well . You would have us blind to your power of working miracles . After yesterday you can hide it no more . Henceforth , Satni , you must no longer confine your teaching to Mieris , to me , to your parents , Yaouma , to a few — henceforth you may speak to all , all ears are opened by this miracle .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Let us leave that ! I pray you rise and tell me rather what has befallen Yaouma .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>Yaouma !— Did she not at first interpret the thunderclap as sign of the wrath of Ammon against her ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>She believes still in Ammon , then , despite all I have said to her .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>Happily I undeceived her . I made her understand that ‘ twas you the elements obeyed , that the thunder that frighted her , was but a sign of your power .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Why should you lie to her ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>It was not wholly lying . Besides , it was fortunate I could thus explain the event . Had you but seen her —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>All my efforts of these two months past , in vain !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>You remember when you left us yesterday . You might have thought that all her superstitions were banished at last . She no longer answered you , she questioned you no more , and at your last words her silence confirmed the belief that at length you had won her away from Ammon . Yet after you were gone , at the moment of entering her hiding place , she was swept with sudden fury as though an evil spirit had entered her , wept , cried and tore her hair —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>What said she ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>“ To the temple ! to the temple ! I would go to the temple ! The God has chosen me ! The God awaits me ! Egypt will perish ! ” In short , words of madness . She would have killed herself !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Killed herself !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>We had to put constraint on her . And ‘ twas only when I led her to this terrace , after the thunderbolt , and pointed out the scattered soldiery , that she came to herself , that at length she perceived that your God was the most powerful . “ What , ” she cried , “ ‘ tis he , he , my Satni , who shakes the heavens and the earth for me ! For me ! ” she murmured , “ for me ! ” She would have kissed your sandals , offered you a sacrifice , worshipped , adored you . See where she comes , with Mieris ! Stay .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>No .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>He goes . Rheou accompanies him . Mieris enters , bearing flowers and led by Yaouma . MIERIS [ listening ] Is he there ?</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>No .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>Leave me . Yaouma goes out . Mieris left alone makes several hesitating steps toward the statue of Isis , then goes up to it and touches it . A pause .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>If it be only of wood ! A gesture of disillusion . She draws slowly away from the statue , letting her flowers fall , broken-hearted , and begins to weep . Rheou returns .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>Why , Mieris — do you bring flowers to Isis still ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>It is the last time . Listen , Rheou — We mast ask Satni to heal me . Do not tell me it is not possible ; he has healed Ahmarsti .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>Healed Ahmarsti ? MIERIS , Yes . He made her drink a liquid wherein no doubt a good genius was hidden , and the evil spirit that tormented her was driven forth . RHEOU<stage>credulously</stage>Is't possible ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>Every one saw it . And Kitoui —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>Well ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>Kitoui , the cripple , went this morning to draw water from the Nile , before all her neighbors who marvelled and cried with joy . And she had merely touched the hem of his garment , even without his knowing it . He has healed the child of Riti , too , he knows gods more powerful than ours — younger gods , perhaps , our gods are so old — If it were not so , how could he have walked unscathed the road where the scarabs lay , that day when he came home ? Since then , men have seen him do a thousand forbidden things , have seen him defy our gods by disrespect . Without the protection of a higher power , how could he escape the chastisement whereof another had died ? Who are his gods ? Rheou , he must make them known to you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>He refuses .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>For what reason ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>The reason he gives is absurd — he says there are no gods —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>No gods ! no gods !— he is mocking you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>He is bound to secrecy , perhaps .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>Rheou , know you that this Ahmarsti — these two years now , on the day of Prodigies , have I heard her at my side howling prayers at the goddess that were never answered .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>I know . Satni declares he could have healed all whom the goddess has relieved . MIERIS<stage>to herself</stage>He relieves even those women whom she abandons —<stage>After a pause</stage>He must teach you the words that work these miracles .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>He refuses .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>Force him !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>He says there are none .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>Threaten him with death — he will speak .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>No . MIERIS<stage>with excitement</stage>But you do not understand me !— he has healed Ahmarsti , he has healed Kitoui , wherefore should he not heal me ? RHEOU<stage>sadly</stage>Ah ! Mieris , Mieris , think you I waited for your prayer , to ask him that ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>Well — Well —?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>I could gain nothing but these words from him : “ Could I overcome the evil Mieris suffers from , even now should she rejoice in the splendor of day . ”</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>Nothing is impossible to the gods , even to ours ; how much more then to his !— He did not yield to your prayers !— Insist , order , threaten ! Force him to speak . You have the right to command him . He is but the son of a potter after all . Let him be whipped till he yield . Do anything , have him whipped to the point of death — or better , offer him fields , the hill of date-trees that is ours ; offer him our flocks , and my jewels and precious stones — tell him we know him for a living god — but I would be healed . I would be healed ! I would see ! See !<stage>With anger</stage>Ah ! you know not the worth of the light , you whose eyes are filled with it ! You cannot picture my misery , you who suffer it not ! You grieve for me , I doubt not , but you think you have done enough , having given me pity !— No , no , I am wrong — I am unjust . But forgive me ; this thought that I might be healed has made me mad . Rheou !— Think , Rheou , what it means to be blind , to have been so always , and to know that beside one are those who see — who see !— The humblest of our shepherds , the most wretched of the women at our looms , I envy them . And when , at times , I hear them complain , I curb myself lest I should strike them , wretches that know not their good fortune . I feel that all you , you who see , should never cease from songs of joy , and hymns of thanksgiving to the gods —<stage>With an outburst</stage>I speak of sight ! Think , Rheou , I have not even a clear idea of what it means “ to see . ” To recognize without touch , to know without need to listen . To perceive the sun another way than by the heat of its rays !— They say the flowers are so beautiful !— I would see you , my well-beloved . Oh ! the day when I shall see your eyes !— I would see , that you may show me some likeness of the little child we lost . You shall point out , among the rest , those that are most like to him . This misery — O my beloved !— I do not often speak of it — but I suffer it ! I suffer it !<stage>She is in his arms</stage>They have taken from me the hope that our gods will heal me , if they give me nothing in its place , know you what I shall do ?— I shall go away , alone , one night , touching the walls , and the trees — and the trees , with my arms outstretched ; I shall go down as far as the Nile and there , gently , I shall glide away to death .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>Peace , O my best beloved ! MIERIS<stage>listening</stage>I hear him — he comes . I leave you with him ! Lead him to my door — love me — save me ! She attempts to go out , he leads her . Satni enters followed by Nourm , Sokiti , and Bitiou .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>Yes ! Thou who art mighty !— Yes ! Yes ! Make me rich — I have had blows of the stick so long ! I would be rich to be able to give them in my turn !— You have but to speak the magic words . SATNI<stage>somewhat brutally</stage>Leave me ! I am no magician .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>I , I do not ask for money . Listen not to him ; he is bad . I , I only ask that you make Khames die ; he has taken from me the girl I would have wed .<stage>Satni pushes him away . Sokiti , weeping , clings to his garments</stage>Grant it , I implore you — I implore you !— My life is gone with her — make him die , I pray you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Leave me !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>Hear me . BITIOU<stage>coming between them and striking Sokiti</stage>Begone ! Begone ! He would not hear you !<stage>Sokiti goes out</stage>Listen — listen — you see I made him go . All — all whom you will , I shall beat them for you . Listen — if you could make me tall like you , and steady on my legs — See — here — I have hidden away , safe , three gold rings , that I stole a while since ; I will give them you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Go , take them to the high priest — BITIOU<stage>pitiably</stage>I have given four to him already . Sokiti and Nourm are conferring together . Enter Rheou . They run away , Bitiou follows , falling and picking himself up .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>What do they want of you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>They came here , following me . They believe me gifted with supernatural power , and crave miracles of me , as though I were a God , or a juggler . I am neither , and I work no miracles .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>None the less you have worked two miracles .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Not one .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>And you will work yet one more .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Never . I came hither not to perform miracles , but to prevent them .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>You will heal Mieris .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>No one can heal her , nor I , nor any other .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>Give her a little hope .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>How can I ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>Tell her you will invoke your God , and that some day perhaps —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>I have no God . If there be a god , he is so great , so far from as , so utterly beyond our comprehension , that for us it is as though he did not exist . To believe that one of our actions , to believe that a prayer could act upon the will of God , is to belittle him , to deny him . He is himself incapable of a miracle ; it would be to belie himself . Could he improve his work , he would not then have created it perfect from the first . He could not do it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>Our ancient gods at least permitted hope .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Keep them .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>In the heart of Mieris , you have destroyed them .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Do you regret it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>Not yet .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>What would you say ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>Even if it be true that sight will never be given her , do not tell her so . Far better promise that she will be healed .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>And to all the others , must I promise healing too ? Because in a house I relieved a child , whose illness sprang from a cause I could remove ; because a woman , ill in imagination , did cure herself by touching my garment 's hem ; must I then descend to play the part of sorcerer ? I had behind me there , but now , a rabble of the wretched imploring me , believing me all powerful , begging for them and theirs unrealizable miracles . Should I then cheat them too , all those poor wretches , promising what I know I cannot give ? I came hither to make an end of lies , not to replace them with others . RHEOU<stage>with passion</stage>Ah ! You would not lie . You would not lie to the wretched . You would not lie to Mieris . You would lie to no one , is it so ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>

       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>We shall see !<stage>Calling right</stage>Yaouma !— Let them send Yaouma !<stage>To Satni</stage>Not to her either , then ? Good ; if you speak the truth to her , if you deny that you have supernatural power , if you force her to believe you had no hand in the miracle that saved her yesterday , she will give herself to the priests , or she will kill herself ! What will you do ? Yaouma enters , she tries to prostrate herself before Satni , who prevents her . In the meantime the Steward greatly moved has come to whisper to Rheou . RHEOU<stage>deeply moved</stage>He is there !</p>

       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>You will want nothing more of me , now that you are a god .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Be not afraid : I am not a god .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>Almost . ‘ Tis a daughter of the Pharaoh you will marry now .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>I will marry you .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>You will swear to .</p>

       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Yes .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>By Ammon ?—<stage>Recollecting</stage>By your god ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>My god is not concerned with us .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>Who then is concerned with us ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>No one .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>You do not want to tell me . You treat me as a child — mocking me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Why do you need an oath ? I love you , and you shall be my wife . YAOUMA<stage>radiant</stage>I shall be your wife !— I , little Yaouma , I shall be wife to a man whom the heavens obey !—<stage>A pause</stage>When I think that you loosed the thunder for my sake —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>No , vain child , I did not loose the thunder .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>Yes , yes , yes — I understand . You want no one to know that you have found the book of Thoth — fear not , I know how to hold my peace .<stage>Coaxingly she puts her arms round Satni 's neck and rubs her cheek against his</stage>Tell me , how did you find it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>I have not found the book of magic spells ; besides , it would have profited me nothing .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>Sit — you would not sit ? They say ‘ tis shut up in three caskets , hidden at the bottom of the sea .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>I tell you again I neither sought , nor found it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>What do you do then , to strike fire from heaven ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>I did not strike fire from heaven . YAOUMA<stage>crossly</stage>Oh ! I do not love you now !— Yes , yes , yes , I love you !<stage>A pause</stage>So it pleased you then , when you were going away in the galley , to see me run barefoot on the bank —?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Yes . YAOUMA<stage>angry</stage>But speak ! speak !<stage>Checking herself , then more coaxing still</stage>You wanted to weep ? No ? You said you did . For my part I know not , then , I could see nothing . But the day of your return , when you learned I was chosen for the sacrifice , then , then I saw your eyes — You love me — You said to me you would prevent me going to the Nile . I believed you not — you remember — Why ! even yesterday , yes , yesterday again , in spite of all your words , I was resolved to escape and go to the temple . It needed this proof of your power !— tell me , it was you who shook the heavens and the earth for me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>No .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>Again !— You must think but little of me , to believe I should reveal what you bade me keep secret .<stage>She lays her hands on Satni 's cheeks</stage>It was you , was it not ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>No , no , no ! a thousand times no !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>It was your gods then , your gods whom I know not .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>No .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>Who was it then ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>No one . YAOUMA<stage>out of countenance</stage>No one !<stage>A pause</stage>You possess no power that other men have not ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>No . YAOUMA<stage>the same</stage>You seem as one speaking truth .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>I speak the truth .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>‘ Tis a pity !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Why ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>It would have been more beautiful .<stage>A long grave pause</stage>To go in the barge , on the Nile , that too had been more beautiful . Rheou and the Steward enter RHEOU<stage>agitated</stage>Go in , Yaouma .<stage>To the Steward</stage>Conduct her to her mistress — and make known to her what has passed .<stage>Yaouma and the Steward go out</stage>Satni , terrible news has come to me : the Pharaoh , finding the people 's enmity increase against him , has taken fright , and striking first , the blow has fallen on me . My goods are confiscated . I am sent to exile . The palace Chamberlain , but now , brought me the order to quit my house to-day , and deliver myself to the army leaving for Ethiopia .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Can you do nothing against this order ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>Yes . I can kill those who gave it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Kill !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>Listen . I bring you the means to win the triumph of your ideas , and at the same time serve my cause . I can arm all the dwellers on my lands . We two must lead them . They will follow you , knowing you all powerful . Nay , hear me — wait . The soldiers , who fear you , will not dare resist us , we shall kill the high priest , the Pharaoh if need be — we shall be masters of Egypt .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>I would not kill .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>So be it . Enough that you declare yourself ready to repeat the miracle of yesterday .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>I would not lie .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>If you would neither kill nor lie , you will never succeed in governing men .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>I would fight the priests of Ammon , not imitate them .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>You will never triumph without doing so . Profit by events . Do not deny the power they believe to be yours . Men will not follow you , if you speak only to their reason . You are above the crowd by your learning ; that gives you rights . You would lead them to the summits ; to get there , one must blindfold those who suffer from dizziness .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>I refuse .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>One would think you were afraid of victory !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Rheou , ‘ tis not the victory of my ideas you seek , ‘ tis your own vengeance , your own ambition .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>They wish to rush the people of Egypt into an unjust and useless war . They hesitate ; they feel the people lacking zest , that is why they have delayed the going of the army till the feast of Prodigies . To-morrow they will make the goddess speak , and all those poor creatures will be led away . You can save thousands of lives by sacrificing a few .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>I refuse . The truth will prevail without help from cruelty or falsehood .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>Never . The crowd is not a woman to be won by loud wooing , but one who must be taken by force , whom you must dominate before you can persuade .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Say no more , Rheou , I refuse .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>Blind ! Fool ! Coward ! Mieris enters , led by Yaouma . A moment later some men — Bitiou , Sokiti , Nourm .</p>

       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>You torture me ! No , I will not be credited with power that is not mine ; to stir men up against their fellows — I would not kill , I tell you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>I understand you , Satni — it is wrong to kill !— But look once more upon me — I am poor now , I am going away , will you not consent to heal me ? SATNI<stage>anguished</stage>Mieris — Could I have healed you , would it not be done already ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>You can do it ! I know you can do it ! Work a miracle .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>A miracle ! Show that your god is more powerful than our gods . A MAN<stage>who has just entered</stage>Heal us !</p>
      </sp>

       <p>Work a miracle .</p>

       <p>There are no miracles !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>A MAN</speaker>
       <p>Then your gods are less mighty than ours .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Yours do not exist . THE PEOPLE<stage>terrified at the blasphemy</stage>Oh !</p>

       <speaker>A MAN</speaker>
       <p>Why do you lead us away from our gods , if you have no others to give us ?</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>ANOTHER</speaker>
       <p>You shall not insult our gods !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>

       <p>We will hand you over to the priests lest the gods smite us for hearing you !</p>

       <speaker>ANOTHER</speaker>
       <p>Ammon will chastise us !</p>

       <p>No .</p>

       <p>You demand it ! You demand a miracle . Well , then , you shall have one , I will do this , but in the presence of all ! Go ! go ! go throughout the domains — bring hither those you find bowed on the earth , or hung to poles for drawing water . Go you others , summon the slaves , the piteous workers — call hither the drawers of stones , bid them drop the ropes that flay their shoulders , bid them come .</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>

       <p>Convince them .</p>

       <p>Do you believe them ready ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>

       <p>You are afraid .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>Day comes not suddenly on night , between them is the dawn . Delethi leads Mieris right under the peristyle .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>I would have day , broad daylight — Now , at once , for all ! ‘ Tis a crime to promise them reward for their suffering . How do we know that they will ever be paid ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>They are so miserable —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>The truth — is the truth good only for the rich ? Will you add that injustice to all the others ? Behold them !<stage>Gradually the slaves and workers of all kinds have entered till they fill the stage . Amongst them Pakh , Sokiti , Bitiou the Dwarf</stage>Yes , behold them , the victims , behold the wretched ! I know you all . You , you are shepherd , you are worse nourished than your flocks , and your beasts , at least , are not given blows . They do not beat the cows nor the sheep . You , you sow and you reap ; beneath the sun , tortured by flies , you gather abundant crops . You sleep in a hole . Others eat the corn you made grow , and sleep on precious stuffs . You , you are forever drawing water from the Nile ; betwixt you and the ox they harness to another machine , there is no difference , and yet you are a man . You , you are one of those who drag great stones , to build the monuments of pride . You are a digger in the tombs , you live a month or more without sight of day . To glorify the death of others , you give your life . You are a trainer of lions for war ; your father was eaten — they would have wept had the lion died — How can it be that you accept all this , when you see beside you happiness without work , and abundance without effort ? I will tell you . ‘ Tis because , in the name of the god Ammon-Ra , they have said to you : “ Have patience , this injustice will last but a life-time . ” Fools ! nothing but that ! All the time you are on earth , suffer , produce for others . Content ye with hunger , you who produce food . Content ye with worse usage than the swine , you who have guard of them . Content ye to sleep in the open , you who build palaces and temples . Content ye with all miseries , you carvers of gold , and setters of precious stones . Look without envy , without anger , on the welfare of those who do nothing , all this will last only the whole of your lives ! After , in another world , you shall have the fulness of all the crops , and the joy of all the pleasures . Well , they lied to you : there is no island of souls , there are no happy fields , there is no life of atonement after this .<stage>Loud murmurs</stage>They have set up these gods for your servile adoration ; they have counselled you : “ Bow down , these gods will avenge you . ” They have said : “ Prostrate yourselves , these gods are just . ” They have said : “ Throw yourselves to earth , these gods are good . ” They have declared them all powerful ; shut them in sanctuaries of awful gloom , whence you are shown them once a year , to keep alive your terror of the Gods ; and last , they have made you believe no man may touch these images and live . I tell you they lied — I will show you they lied to you . Behold the most mighty Ammon — the father of the gods — I spit my hate at him ! Thou art but an idol ; I curse thee for evil men have done in thy name ! I curse thee in the name of all the enslaved , in the name of all those they have cheated with hopes of an avenging life ; in the name of all who for thousands of years have groaned and wept ; suffered insult , outrage , blows , death , without thought of revolt , because promises made in thy name had soothed their rage to sleep ! And I curse thee for the sorrow that now fills me , and for the ills that must come even of thy going ! Die !<stage>He throws a stool in the face of the statue</stage>You others do as I . Go , climb their pedestals ! Lay hold of their hands , they are lifeless ! Strike , ‘ tis but an image ! Spit in their faces , they are senseless ! Strike ! Ruin ! All this is nothing but hardened mud ! The crowd which had punctuated the words of Satni with cries and murmurs has approached the statues behind him and followed his example , blaspheming , and howling with fury . The more courageous begin , being hoisted to the pedestals , the rest follow suit . The gods are overthrown .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>Now , let them open my granaries , that each may help himself ; and take from my flocks to sate you all . Cries of joy , they go out slowly . Bitiou in the meantime approaches an overthrown statue and still half-afraid , kicks it . He tries to run , falls , picks himself up , then seeing that decidedly there is no danger , seats himself on the stomach of the goddess Thoueris and bursts into a peal of triumphant bestial laughter .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BITIOU</speaker>
       <p>Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! Then he perceives the little statue of Isis which Mieris shields with her arms , points it out to a couple of men who advance to it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELETHI</speaker>
       <p>Mistress , they would take Isis ! MIERIS<stage>in tears</stage>Let me keep her —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>No , Mieris . MIERIS<stage>letting go</stage>Take her —<stage>Then</stage>Stay !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RHEOU</speaker>
       <p>Wherefore ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>

       <p>Can you part from her , and feel nothing ? Even now , Satni , in denouncing the gods to the fury of the crowd , you did not say everything — You , who can see her , behold this little image , think how many tears were shed before her , in the years since she was made . She has been ours for generations . Call up the countless crowds of those who have fixed their anxious looks upon her eyes , dead even as mine are . It is for all the anguish she has looked upon , we must respect her . Tears make holy . I doubt not you are right : she must be broken too — but not without farewell .<stage>To Yaouma</stage>Where is she , Yaouma ? I would say my last prayer to her .<stage>To the statue</stage>Oh , them who didst not heal , but didst console me ; O thou who hast heard so many entreaties and thanksgivings , thou art but clay ! Yet men have given thee life ; thy life was not in thee , it was in them — and the proof is that thou diest , now they have taken their soul from thee . I give thee over to those who would break thee , but I revere thee , I salute thee , and I thank thee for all the hope thou hast given me ; and I thank thee in the name of all the sorrows that thou hast sent to sleep .<stage>To the men</stage>Take her hence — let them destroy her with respect . They take Isis away .</p>

       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>There is nothing so sad or so great as the death of a god !<stage>A pause . To Yaouma , who comes through the crowd</stage>Behold , Yaouma ! The gods are dead and I live — behold them ! Do you believe me — do you believe me ? Sadly Yaouma looks at the broken statues , then bursts into tears before Satni , who stands amazed .</p>

       <stage>SCENE :— The yard in front of the potter 's hut . On the right from the middle of the back of the scene to the footlights , the walls of the dwelling made of beaten clay . Two unequal doors . The wall is slightly raised supporting a terrace where pottery of all kinds is drying in the sun . Left , a wall of loose stones high enough to lean on . Between the wall and the house an opening leading to an invisible inclined plane that descends to the Nile , the water and opposite bank of which are visible . Behind the house and on the right groups of lofty palms . The whole is abject misery beneath the splendor of a heaven blazing with light .</stage>
       <stage>Kirjipa , crouching down , is grinding corn between a large and a small stone . Satni is seated on the wall dreaming .</stage>

       <p>Satni , I have been seeking you . Since this morning unhappy things have come to pass —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Yaouma is not in danger , or Mieris , of Rheou ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>

       <p>No . All three are safe in the palace .</p>

       <p>Well ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>

       <p>You remember the order the master gave me this morning , after the death of the gods ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>No .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>When I went to obey , to my amazement I beheld the men stand by the door in earnest converse , then without entering they withdrew . This is what happened . They went to the house of the neighboring master , roused his servants and laborers , and strove to force them to overthrow the statues of his gods , and rob him of his corn . They killed his steward . Soldiers came — Nepk had been killed , others too . Then all were scattered . The master sent me to bid you reason with those whom you might find . Look ! there are some who have taken refuge here !<stage>To some men who are outside</stage>Enter — come — Satni would speak with you ! Bitiou , Sokiti , and Nourm appear behind the wall . Bitiou comes in . SATNI<stage>To Bitiou</stage>Whither go you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>Whither go you ? Whence come you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BITIOU</speaker>
       <p>I followed the others —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>Whence come you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BITIOU</speaker>
       <p>I came back with the others , Sokiti and Nourm .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Where are they ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BITIOU</speaker>
       <p>There .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>Bid them enter . SATNI<stage>going to the door</stage>Sokiti , Nourm , come . Sokiti and Nourm enter awkwardly .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>Why do you hide yourselves ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>We do not hide from you , but from the Lybian soldiers .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Why do you fear them ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>Because they are chasing us .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>And why are they chasing you ? The three men look at each other .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Bitiou , answer .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BITIOU</speaker>
       <p>Bitiou knows not . STEWARD<stage>to the others</stage>You know it , you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>They took us for the others .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>What others ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>Perhaps they took us for the servants of the neighboring master .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>They have done mischief , then , the servants of the neighboring master ?<stage>Pause</stage>Answer — you ! NOURM<stage>to Satni</stage>They did that at his house , that you made us do at yours .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>The priests heard of it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>No , but the master sent for the soldiers .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Only for that !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>I know not .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Had there been nothing else , he would not have sent for the Lybian soldiers . He knew our projects — he is with us . There is something else , eh !— Bitiou yawns loudly .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>Yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>What ? SOKITI<stage>to Nourm</stage>Tell .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>They were angered with the master . He was bad , the master .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>He is hard , but he gives much to those who have nothing .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>He gave here , that he might receive hereafter .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>After his death .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>And now he gives no more ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>Nothing .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Ah !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BITIOU</speaker>
       <p>Nothing — and so , all stomachs empty , very much .<stage>He laughs</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>He gives only blows of the stick now . SOKITI<stage>with conviction</stage>One cannot live on that alone .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>And so his servants asked him for corn ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BITIOU</speaker>
       <p>No good — only blows of the stick .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>They took the corn that was refused them ? BITIOU<stage>laughing</stage>Hunger !<stage>A gesture</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>You knew they were going to do that ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>Yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>It was for that you went to join them ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>Yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>Why ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>It came into our heads like this : better not take corn from the good master , but take it from the bad one .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>Justice ! BITIOU<stage>to the Steward</stage>You content . You still got all your corn . He laughs , his comrades laugh with him .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>You , we like you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BITIOU</speaker>
       <p>You — good ! We — good !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>See ! BITIOU<stage>collecting two ideas</stage>Wait : neighboring master bad . They bad .<stage>To the others</stage>Heh ?— Heh ?— you see — Heh ? Heh ?<stage>All three draw themselves up proudly and laugh</stage>And the steward he bad , he dead — well done !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>What would he say ? SOKITI<stage>laughing</stage>They took the steward and then —<stage>Chokes with laughter</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>They gave him back all the blows of the stick they had had from him .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>You saw that ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>Yes . SOKITI<stage>proudly</stage>Me too , me too —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BITIOU</speaker>
       <p>I laugh very much — because — because — Steward , very big , strong , and then when very much beaten , fell down — fell on the ground — like me ! like me ! He , big , he fell down just the same — he like Bitiou — I very glad .<stage>During what follows he plays with his foot</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>What they have done is bad .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>No . The steward had been happy all his life . He was old .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>He was old . So ‘ tis not bad to have killed him — He had finished — He was fat — and he had lost his appetite —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>Only just , he should leave his place to another .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>We must not kill .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>What does that mean ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>Yes , kill a good one , that is bad . But kill a bad one , that is good .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>And if you are mistaken ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>No , he is bad , I kill him .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>What if he be not bad , and you think him so ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>If he were not bad , I should not think it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>You do not understand — Listen , I am not bad , am I ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>But we do not want to kill you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>Let me speak . You remember Kob the black . He thought me bad .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>Yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>And if he had killed me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>We are not blacks —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>You do not understand me . Consider . He thought me bad . I am not bad . What you were saying , would justify him if he had killed me . They consider .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>I understand . You say : If the slave had killed me — no , it is not that .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Human life must be respected . Gravely they make sign of acquiescence , to escape further torment . Nourm picks up a package he had brought and turns to go out unobserved .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>What are you carrying there ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>Nothing , ‘ tis mine —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BITIOU</speaker>
       <p>That is a necklace — show .<stage>Begins to open the package</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>Yes , a necklace .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>From whom did you take it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>From the neighboring master .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Do you think you did well ? NOURM<stage>hesitating</stage>Why — yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>You are wrong .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>Be not afraid , no one saw me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>It is wrong .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>No . What can wrong me , is wrong . Since no one saw me , they will not punish me . So it is not wrong .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Wrong not to you , but to the neighboring master .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>He has many others .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>Has had them for years , he has ! Nourm never had one . Not just . I , I never had , this —<stage>He holds up a bracelet</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>You have taken this bracelet ! SOKITI<stage>delighted</stage>It is mine .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>We are content . They laugh .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>And Bitiou —</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>BITIOU</speaker>
       <p>No woman would come willingly with Bitiou .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>But she escaped from him .</p>

       <p>Yes .<stage>He weeps</stage></p>

       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>You must give back the necklace and this bracelet to the neighboring master .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>Give back , but he has others !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>You cannot make yourself the judge of that . If you were selling perfumes , for instance , would you think it natural that a man should come and take them from you , because you had plenty and he had none ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>You tell me hard things .</p>

       <p>Yes , master .</p>

       <p>Yes , master . A sorrowful pause .</p>

       <p>See , you are sad . You perceive that you did wrong .</p>

       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>Yes , we did wrong —</p>

       <p>Ah !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>We did wrong to tell you what we did , because you are not pleased .</p>

       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>‘ Tis for your sake I am grieved .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>Then you have not told the truth ; there is a hell , and there is an island of souls .</p>

       <p>No .</p>

       <p>If the gods do not punish , and men , not having seen , do not punish either —<stage>Pause</stage>Well — I shall give it back .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>I , I shall not give back . Not stolen . Another , a servant of the neighboring master stole the bracelet , not I !</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>STEWARD</speaker>
       <p>Yet ‘ tis you who have it .</p>

       <p>I took it from the other .</p>

       <p>He let you do it ?</p>

       <speaker>SOKITI</speaker>
       <p>Yes . Could not help it , he was wounded .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>You should have succored him .</p>

       <p>He was a man like you .</p>

       <p>There are plenty of them .</p>

       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>We must do good to others .</p>

       <p>What good will that do to me ?</p>

       <p>I would rather have the bracelet —</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>It is only by refraining from doing one another harm that mankind may hope to gain happiness ; nay more , only by lending one another aid . Do you understand ? SOKITI<stage>gloomily</stage>Yes .</p>

       <p>Why ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>NOURM</speaker>
       <p>Because you are not pleased .</p>

       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>No , we must seek patiently to straighten it .<stage>With feeling</stage>And above all we must keep straight those that are young . Cries are heard outside .</p>

      <sp>

       <p>What cries are those ?</p>

       <p>Women in distress . Yaouma enters , leading Mieris . Both are agitated .</p>

       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>Come , mistress — come — We are at the house of the potter , the father of Satni — Satni help — quick ! quick ! Run ! your father , Satni !</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>We were set upon by some men .</p>

       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>He defended us — But they will kill him — go ! Satni and the Steward seize some arms left by Nourm and run out .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>Nourm ! Run to the palace , bid them send hither those who drive forth the evil spirits —</p>
      </sp>

       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>Alas ! mistress , I do fear — already he has fallen — struck to earth .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>They will save him , they will bear him hither —</p>

       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>Will they bear him hither alive ? MIERIS<stage>to Nourm</stage>Run !— You hear !— Run to the palace , bid those who assist at the last hour be ready to come . If he have died defending us , the same honors shall be paid him as though ourselves were dead ! Go !<stage>Nourm goes out . A pause</stage>Now , Yaouma , lead me out upon the road to the Nile .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>Mistress , you seek to die ? Many then must be your sorrows !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>Alas ! Alas ! Why did you discover my flight ? Why did you seek me , find me , and bring me back —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>Had I not guessed your purpose ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>What have I left to live for ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>You have lived all these years in spite of your affliction , what is there that is changed ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>What is there that is changed ! You ask me what is changed ! Until now I lived in the hope of a miracle .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>Perhaps it would never have come .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>Even at my last hour I should have still looked for it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>Then you would have died believing in a lie — if what they say be true .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>What matter , I had smiled as I died , thinking death but the journey to a land where my lost child was waiting for me . The death of a child ! No mother ever can believe , at heart , in that . It is too unjust — too cruel to be possible . One says to oneself : it is but a separation ! Oh ! Satni , thy doctrines may be the truth . But they declare this separation eternal ; they make the death of our loved ones final , irreparable , horrible , therefore I foretell thee this : Women will never believe them ! What is there that is changed ?— Yesterday , children came playing close to us . You know how their cries and laughter made me glad — the voice of one of them was like the voice of mine . I made him come , I put out my hand , in the old way . I felt , at the old height , tossed hair , and the warmth of a living body . And I did not weep , but my voice spoke in my heart and said : “ Little child , thy years are as many as his , whom she-who-loves-the-silence took from me . But in Amenti , where he is , in the island of souls , he is happier than thou , for he is safe from all the ills that threaten thee . He is happier than thou . He lives beneath a sun of gold , amid flowers of strange beauty , and perfumed baths refresh him . And when she-who-loves-the-silence takes me in my turn , I shall see him , I shall see him for the first time — and I shall fondle him as I fondle thee , and none , then , may put us asunder . Go , little child , the happy ones are not on this side of the earth ! ” Now have I lost the hope of a better life before death , and the hope of a better life beyond as well . If you took both crutches from a cripple , he would fall . Only this twofold hope sustained me . They have taken it from me . And so , it is the end , it is the end — ‘ tis as though I were fallen from a height , I am broken , I have no strength left to bear with life : I tell you , it is the end , it is the end ! YAOUMA<stage>with intense fervor</stage>Mistress , they speak not the truth !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>Our gods , did they exist , would already have taken vengeance .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>Before the outrage , already , they had taken vengeance on you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>Good Yaouma , you would give me back my faith , you who could not keep your own .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>Mistress , I lied to you ; nothing is destroyed in me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>You refuse to give yourself in sacrifice !— Oh , you are right ....</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>I do not refuse .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>You do not ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>No . Know you how I learned , a while ago , that you were gone ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>How ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>I , too , was seeking to escape .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>You ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>To go to the temple , to place myself in hands of the priests , to give to Ammon the victim he has chosen .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>Do you believe in all these fables still ? YAOUMA<stage>in a low voice</stage>Mistress , I have seen Isis .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>Has one of her images been spared then ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>It was not an image that I saw . It was Isis herself , the goddess — I have seen her .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>You — you have seen — what is it ? I know not what you say — to see — that word has no clear sense for me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>She has spoken to me —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>You have heard her voice —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>I have heard her voice .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>How ! How !— You were sleeping — ‘ twas in a dream —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>I did not sleep . I did not dream . I saw her . I heard her . I was alone , and I wept . A great sound filled me with terror . A great light blinded me . Perfumes unknown ravished my senses . And I beheld the goddess , more beauteous than a queen . Then all was gone —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>But her voice —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>The next day she came again , she spoke to me , she called me by name and said to me : “ Egypt will be saved by thee . ”</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>Why did you not speak of it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>I feared they would not believe me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>Oh , Yaouma , how I envy you ! If you but knew the ill they have done me . They have half killed me , killing all the legends and all the memories that were mine . They made me blush at my simplicity . I felt shamed to have been so easily fooled by such gross make-believes . And now , what have I gained by this revelation ? My soul is a house after the burning , black , ruined , empty . Nothing is left but ruins , ruins one might laugh at .<stage>In tears</stage>I am parched with thirst , I hunger , I tremble with cold . They have made my soul blind , too . I cry out for help , for consolation . Oh ! for a lie , some other lie , to replace the one they have taken away from me !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YAOUMA</speaker>
       <p>Why ask a lie ? Why not forget what they have said . Why not recall what you learned at your mother 's knee — Why not , yourself , set up in your heart again , those images which they threw down —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>Yes ! Yes ! I will do it . They have awakened my reason , and killed my faith . I shall kill my reason , to revive our gods . Though I no longer believe , I shall do the actions of believers — and , if my god be false , I shall believe so firmly in him that I shall make him true !— Yes , the lowest , the most senseless superstitions , I venerate them , I exalt — I glory in them ! The ugliest , the most deformed , the most unreal of our gods , I adore them , and I bow down before their impossibility .<stage>She kneels</stage>Oh , I stifle in their petty narrow world , sad as a forest without birds ! Air ! Air ! Singing ! The sound of wings ! Things that fly ! YAOUMA<stage>kneeling</stage>Let me be sacrificed !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>

Kirjipa almost swooning follows , supported by some women who lead her into the house . The Exorcist , who with his two assistants follows Pakh , takes some clay from a coffer carried by one of his men , shapes it into a ball , and begins , then , the incantation .</p>

       <speaker>EXORCIST</speaker>
       <p>Pakh ! Son of Ritii ! Through thy wound an evil spirit has entered thee . I am about to speak the words that shall drive him out : “ The virtues of him who lies there , and who suffers , are the virtues of the father of the gods . The virtues of his brow are the virtues of the brow of Thoumen . The virtues of his eye are the virtues of the eye of Horus , who destroys all creatures . ” A pause .</p>

       <p>All your knowledge , then , is but knowledge of how to destroy — My son !— I pray you — my blood goes out with my life — I do not want to die ! I pray you — give me your hand . I seem to be sinking into night — hold me back — you will not let me die — your father ! I am your father . I gave you life — hold me back — all grows dim around me — But at least do something — speak — say the incantations —<stage>He raises himself</stage>No ! No ! I refuse to die ! I am not old .<stage>Strongly</stage>I will not ! I will not ! Do not let go my hand !

To die — to die —<stage>A long pause</stage>And after ?<stage>Pause</stage>And so this is a poor man 's life ! Work from childhood , blows . Then work , always , without profit . Only for bread . And still work . For others . Not one pleasure . We die . And ‘ tis finished ! You came back to teach me that — Work — blows — misery — the end .<stage>A silence</stage>What did you come here to do ? Is that your work ?<stage>Strongly</stage>Satni , Satni ! Give me back my faith ! I want it ! Ah ! Why were you born a destroyer ? Is that your truth ?

For me , too , at this moment there would have been comfort in a lie — He weeps , kneeling by the body with his arms stretched over it . Kirjipa appears at the door of the house .

      <sp>
       <speaker>THE PHARAOH</speaker>
       <p>He has declared he knows the secret recess , whence one of your priests makes the head of the image move .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>Most like he speaks the truth .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>THE PHARAOH</speaker>
       <p>He declares the miracle will not take place . If the people suffer this disappointment , tell me what chance can there be for the war of conquest I would wage in Ethiopia ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>Why wage a war of conquest in Ethiopia ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>THE PHARAOH</speaker>
       <p>I need gold . I need women . I need slaves . There will be a share of the spoil for your temple .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>I like not bloodshed .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>THE PHARAOH</speaker>
       <p>The treasury is empty . Our whippings are useless now . Our blows no longer bring forth taxes . If the people lose confidence in the gods , what will happen to-morrow ? Who will follow me , unless they believe the gods confirm my orders ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>Satni will not prevent the miracle .</p>

       <speaker>THE PHARAOH</speaker>
       <p>What do you know of it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>I know .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>THE PHARAOH</speaker>
       <p>Is Satni dead ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>He lives . THE PHARAOH<stage>suddenly guessing</stage>You are hiding him !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>Yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>THE PHARAOH</speaker>
       <p>You knew I was about to rid me of him , and you took him to prevent me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>Yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>THE PHARAOH</speaker>
       <p>What do you intend ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>It shall be done with him as I wish , not as you wish .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>THE PHARAOH</speaker>
       <p>His crime is a crime against Egypt .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>A crime against me . That is still more grave . Therefore be satisfied .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>THE PHARAOH</speaker>
       <p>Why then all these ceremonies before you kill him ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>That all may know his faults .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>THE PHARAOH</speaker>
       <p>Satni was one of yours , and you defend him .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>We must not make martyrs — if we can avoid it . In killing Satni you would have killed only a man . If what I dream succeed , I shall kill his work . That is a better thing .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>THE PHARAOH</speaker>
       <p>What will you make of him ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>A priest .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>THE PHARAOH</speaker>
       <p>A priest ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>He was initiated before he went away . He was then a young man , pious and wise . On his travels he lost some piety , and gained some wisdom .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>THE PHARAOH</speaker>
       <p>Have I not always said : “ it is not good to travel . ”</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>I think like you . Travellers learn too much . Yet am I hopeful . I shall bring him back to our gods .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>THE PHARAOH</speaker>
       <p>You will fail .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>He who for long has breathed the air of temples can never wholly clear his breast of it . If he give way , he shall never leave the house of the Gods again , if he be still rebellious , he shall leave to go to his death .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>THE PHARAOH</speaker>
       <p>I order you to give Satni up to me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>I would I might bow to your will . But he is a priest : his life is sacred . And I may not transgress the orders given me by the Gods .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>THE PHARAOH</speaker>
       <p>Prate not of these follies to me — do you take me for one of your priests ? Obey ! I command you !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>Do you take me for one of your soldiers ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>THE PHARAOH</speaker>
       <p>I command it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>The gods forbid .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>THE PHARAOH</speaker>
       <p>I laugh at your gods .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>Beware lest your people hear .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>THE PHARAOH</speaker>
       <p>I would be master , in truth . And more , I refuse to submit to the humiliation that again you put on me a while ago .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>How should that humiliate you ? Before you , the highest bow down .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>THE PHARAOH</speaker>
       <p>Yes . And straightway , then , I must bow me down before you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>You salute , not me , but the god whom I represent .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>THE PHARAOH</speaker>
       <p>I pay homage to the god , it is the priest who receives it . HIGH PRIEST<stage>faintly smiling</stage>Rest assured ! I pass it on to him .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>THE PHARAOH</speaker>
       <p>And you mock me , besides ! Oh ! if I but dared to kill you , hypocrite !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>Vain man !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>THE PHARAOH</speaker>
       <p>You tremble at sight of a sword , coward !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>Being a butcher , you know only how to kill .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>THE PHARAOH</speaker>
       <p>Liar !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>Who made you Pharaoh ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>THE PHARAOH</speaker>
       <p>Beware lest one day I have you thrown to my lions !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>Beware lest one day I strike the crown of the two Egypts from your head , telling the people the god has set his face against you !<stage>A pause</stage>Come , we must work together . We complete each other . To govern men , we have both the reality of the evils you inflict on them , and the hope of the good I promise them . Believe me , we must work together . The day that one of us disappears , the fate of the other will be in jeopardy — I perceive they make sign to me . They think our prayers are long and fervent . The hour is come for you to receive the acclamation of your people , and follow them to the shrine of Isis — when Satni will not prevent the miracle , I pledge my word to that . The cortége comes on and goes out with Pharaoh . Satni is led before the High Priest .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>You know me again ! SATNI<stage>troubled</stage>Yes , you are the High Priest . HIGH PRIEST<stage>with sweet gentleness</stage>I , too , I know you again . Your father is a potter . You were brought up and taught by us . In the crowd of neophytes I singled you out by your gentleness , your great intelligence ; and I saw you destined for the highest dignities . I esteemed you , I was fond of you . We took you from wretchedness . What you know , for the most part , you owe to us . This thing that you have done should anger me — I am only sad , my son .<stage>A pause</stage>You are troubled .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Yes , I looked for threats , for torture . The kindness of your voice unmans me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>Be not distressed . Forget who I am . None hear us . Let us talk together as father and son . Or better , since your learning makes you worthy , as two men . You have proclaimed broadcast that the miracle will not come to pass .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>The goddess is stone . Stone does not move itself . The image will not bow its head unless man intervene .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>That is evident .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>You admit it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>To you , yes . We give to each one the faith he deserves . Had you remained with us , at each step in the priesthood you would have beheld the gods rise with you , become more immaterial , more noble , as you became more learned . We give to the people the gods they can understand . Our god is different . He is the one who exists in essence . The one who lives in substance , the sole procreator who was not engendered , the father of the fathers , the mother of mothers . The one and only . And we crave his pardon for belittling him by miracles . But they are part of that faith which alone contents the simple-minded . You are above them — I admit freely that the miracle could be prevented . You declared it would not take place — you have found the means to make it impossible ? SATNI<stage>suspecting the trap</stage>I said that , left to herself , the goddess would not move .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>To say only that , would not have served you . You intended to prevent the miracle . Come , admit it — it is so .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Perhaps .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>By seizing you , I prevent your committing the sacrilege . Your purpose will not be realized . In an hour the festival of the Prodigy will take place , and you are my prisoner . It follows then , the miracle will be performed — you believe that , do you not ? SATNI<stage>after a pause</stage>Yes , I believe it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>And so your cause is lost .<stage>A pause</stage>Listen to me ; the priests who have taken their final vows are as wise and as little credulous as you . I offer you a place among them . Return to us . A little wisdom banishes the gods — great wisdom brings them back .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>I refuse .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>My son , my son , you will not cause me this sorrow . Think what you will drive me to , if you refuse — Satni , do not force me to send you before the tribunal , whose sentence must be death . Death , for you , so young , whose future is so bright !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>I do not fear death .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>Besides — I mind me — you were betrothed to that little Yaouma whom the god has chosen as victim . You know she may be saved from the sacrifice , if she become the wife of a priest . They guarded her but ill at Rheou 's house , she is here . I have seen her ; she is kind and gentle , and you would lead a happy life with her .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Yaouma ! Yaouma !<stage>He hides his face</stage>HIGH PRIEST<stage>laying a hand on his shoulder</stage>So that on one side is Yaouma 's death and yours ; on the other , happiness with her — and power . Say nothing . I speak as a father might , you can see . I say besides , that you will better serve the crowd in leaving them their gods . I wish to convince you of it , and you will stay with us — weep no more . You will stay , will you not ? Wait ! Hear me , before you answer . You seek happiness for the lower orders ? There is no happiness for them without religion . Already you have seen what they become , when it is taken from them . The riots of yesterday cost your father his life . He suffered much , they tell me . Is it true ? I do not know the details . You saw him die , did you not ? Tell me how it happened .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Ah ! I was right . It was in truth torture that awaited me here . You have guessed you would gain nothing racking my body — you keep your torments for my heart .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>Have I said other than what is true ? The conversions that your preaching made were followed by disorders — was it not then that your father was wounded ? I knew him . He was a man , simple and good . You are the cause of his death , as you will be the cause of Yaouma 's .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Peace ! You would have my sorrows crush my will !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>I shall speak of them no more . But think of the people of Egypt , what evils you would bring on them ! If you take away their religion , what will keep them virtuous ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>What you call their virtue , is only their submission .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>You let loose their vilest instincts , if you remove the fear of the gods .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>The fear of the gods has prevented fewer crimes than were needed to create it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>Be it so . But it exists .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>It is your interest to spread the belief , that the fear of the gods is a restraint . And you know that it is not . You do not leave the punishment of crime to the gods . You have the lash , hard labor in the mines ; you have scaffolds , you have executioners . No one believes sincerely in the happy life beyond the grave . If we believed , we should kill ourselves , the sooner to reach the Island of the Souls , the fields of Yalou .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>By what then are the appetites restrained ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>By the laws , by the need of the esteem of others —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>We have just seen that , in sooth . So then it was virtue that the people showed yesterday , after you made them break their gods ? They seemed to care little for the esteem of others , for they stole , they pillaged , they killed . Do you approve of that ? Have they gained your esteem , those who have done what they have done ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Oh , I know ! I know ! That is your strongest argument . Creatures degraded by centuries of slavery , drunk with the first hours of freedom , commit crimes . You argue from this , that they were meant for slaves . Yes , it is true that if you take a child from the leading strings that upheld it , the child falls down . But you who watch over it , you rejoice at the fall , for then you can assert that the child must go back to its leading strings — and be kept in them till death .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>Then you declare that all supports must be suppressed ?<stage>A pause</stage>Religion is a prop . It soothes — consoles . He does evil who disturbs it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Many religions died before ours . The passing of each caused the sorrows you foresee . Should we then have kept the first , to prevent some suffering ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>Ours is yet young , though so old ; look in the halls of our temples , behold the countless thank-offerings brought there for prayers that were granted .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Your temples could not hold the offerings , unthinkable in number , that those whose prayers were not granted might have made , and who none the less prayed as well as the others .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>Even unanswered their prayers were recompensed . They had hope , and it is likewise a boon to the poor to promise them welfare in the world to come .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>You promise them welfare in the world to come , to make them forget that all the welfare in this world is yours .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>Can you give happiness to all who are on earth ? We are more generous than you ; at least we give them consolation .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>You make them pay dear for it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>In truth the granaries of our temples are full to overflowing . Left to themselves , the people would not think of the lean years , in the years of abundance . We think for them , and they bring us , gladly , what they would refuse did they not believe they gave to the gods . We proclaim the Nile sacred ; it is forbidden to sully its waters . Is that to honor it as a god ? Not so , it is to avoid the plague . And all the animals we deified are those man has need of . You did not learn all things on your travels —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>You would have the peasant remain a child , because you fear the reckoning he would demand of you , if you let him grow up . You know you could not stay him then by showing him the god-jackal , the god-ram , the god-bull , and the rest that do not exist .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>Are you certain they do not exist ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>Know you where you are ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>In the temple .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>In the temple ; where you were brought up . There was a time when you dared not have crossed the first sacred enclosure . You are in the third . Look round ! There is the holy of holies . At my will the stones that mask the entrance will roll back , and the goddess will be unveiled . Except the High Priest and the Pharaoh , no mortal , if he be not priest himself , may look on her and live — save at the hour of the annual Festival of Prodigies , which is upon us now . Do you believe that you can endure to be alone in her presence ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>I do believe it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>We shall see . If you be afraid , call and prostrate yourself . Afterwards you shall go and tell what you have seen , to those whom you deceived . The High Priest makes a sign . Total darkness . A peal of thunder .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Ah !<stage>Terrified , he leaps forward . A faint light returns slowly , the temple is empty</stage>I am alone !<stage>He is terrified , standing erect against a pillar facing the audience</stage>Alone in the temple , within sight of the goddess almost . I know ‘ tis but an image — yet am I steeped in terror , even to the marrow of my bones .<stage>He utters an agonized cry</stage>Ah !— I thought I beheld in the darkness — No — I know that there is nothing — Oh ! coward nature ! Because I was cradled amid tales of religion , because I grew up in the fear of the gods , because my father and my father 's father , and all those from whom I come , were crushed by this terror even from the blackest night of time , I tremble , and my reason totters . All this is false , I know — the god obeys the priest . Yet , from these towering columns , horror and mystery descend upon me —<stage>A thunder clap brings him to his knees . The stones that mask the entrance to the sanctuary roll slowly back . He tries to look</stage>The holy of holies opens — I am afraid — I am afraid —<stage>He mutters words , wipes the sweat from his brow with his hand . He trembles and falls sobbing to the ground . A long pause</stage>‘ Tis the beast in me that is afraid — Ah ! coward flesh !<stage>Biting his hands</stage>I shall conquer thee — I would chastise my weakness . I am shamed — I am shamed — In spite of all I will look her in the face . I have the will ! but I must fight against so many memories , against all the dead whose spirits stir in mine . I shall conquer the dead . My life , and my will — courage ! With great effort and after many struggles he gains the mastery of himself , goes to the shrine and looks upon the goddess . The High Priest reappears touching him on the shoulder .</p>

       <speaker>HIGH PRIEST</speaker>
       <p>Terror does not move you . Let us see if you be proof against pity . Come —<stage>He leads him to the side of the shrine , presses a spring and a door opens , revealing in the interior of the shrine the machinery of the miracle , a lever and cordage</stage>Look ! ‘ Tis by pressing this lever that one of ours , in a little while , will bring about the miracle . I leave you in his place . At my signal the doors of the sacred enclosure will open , and the people draw near the sanctuary . Listen to them . And if you are moved to pity by their prayers , you — you shall give them the consoling lie for which they pray .</p>

You have declared that if you did permit the images of the gods to be thrown down before you , it was because the spells of Satni had clouded your reason . Ammon has proclaimed to me that you are sincere ! You are pardoned , on conditions which I shall presently impart .<stage>Rheou bows and kneels down</stage>Satni !<stage>Satni stands up .

       <p>Curse me . You are right . I am guilty . I had not the strength to persevere ; to lead you , in spite of your tears , to the summits I would lead you to . To still a few sobs , to give hope to some who were stricken , I worked the miracle ; and , beholding that false miracle , you made submission . I have confirmed , I have strengthened the empire of the lie .</p>

       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>I have given back your minds , for another age , to slavery and debasement . I have given back to the priests their power that was endangered . I have given them means to increase your burdens , to take your daughters , to send you to a war , covetous , murderous , and unjust .</p>

       <speaker>A MAN</speaker>
       <p>You are a spy from Ethiopia !</p>

       <p>You are a traitor to your country !</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>ALL</speaker>
       <p>Yes ! a traitor ! Death to the traitor !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>And to defend your tyrants , you will kill men as wretched as yourselves , dupes like you , and like you enslaved .</p>

       <speaker>A MAN</speaker>
       <p>We know you are paid to betray Egypt !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ALL</speaker>
       <p>Yes , we know it ! We know the price of your treason !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ANOTHER</speaker>
       <p>You would sell Egypt , and ‘ tis to weaken us you would overthrow our gods .</p>

       <speaker>ALL</speaker>
       <p>Traitor ! Traitor !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>If I am a traitor , ‘ tis to my own cause ! But a while ago I was proud of my deed , thinking I had sacrificed myself to you . Alas ! I only sacrificed your future to my pity . I wept for you ; to weep for misfortune — what is that but an easy escape from the duty of fighting its cause ? I pitied you . Pity is but a weakness , a submission — To perpetuate the falsehood of the miracle , and the life of atonement to come is to drug misery to sleep .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>A MAN</speaker>
       <p>Misery !— can you give us anything to cure it ? They laugh .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>They have implanted in you , the belief that misery is immortal , invincible . By my falsehood , I too have seemed to admit this ; and thus I have helped those , in whose interest it is that misery should last for ever .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>A MAN</speaker>
       <p>He insults the Pharaoh !</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Had there been no miracle , you would have despaired — you would have sorrowed . I ought to have faced that . I ought to have faced the death of a few , to save the future of all . We go forward only by destroying . What matter blood and pain ! Pain and blood — never a child is born without them ! I would — An angry outburst .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>A WOMAN</speaker>

       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>It is in this world that the wretched must find their paradise , it is here that every one 's good must be sought with a zeal that knows no limit , save respect for the good of others . A burst of laughter .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PEOPLE</speaker>
       <p>He is mad ! He knows not what he says ! He is mad ! Yaouma is borne on right on a litter carried by young girls . She is decked out like an idol ; she stands erect , half in ecstasy .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PEOPLE</speaker>
       <p>Yaouma ! The chosen of Ammon-Ra ! Glory to her who goes to save Egypt ! With jubilant cries the procession goes slowly towards the gates at the back , preceded and surrounded by musicians and dancers .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>Yaouma ! Yaouma ! One word ! One look of farewell ! Yaouma ! ‘ Tis I , Satni ! Look on me ! The acclamations drown his voice . Yaouma is wrapped in her soul 's dream . She passes without hearing Satni 's voice . The crowd follows her . MIERIS<stage>to Delethi who supports her</stage>Lead me to Satni — go —<stage>To Satni</stage>Satni , your words have sunk deep in my heart — Yaouma , they tell me , did not hear your voice . She is lost in the joy of sacrifice . The need to make sacrifice is in us all . If the gods are not , to whom shall we sacrifice ourselves ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATNI</speaker>
       <p>To those who suffer .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>To those who suffer . During this Bitiou has come slowly down behind Satni .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BITIOU</speaker>
       <p>Look ! He too , he will fall down ! He plunges a dagger in Satni 's back . Delethi draws Mieris away . Satni falls . SATNI<stage>raising himself slightly</stage>It was you who struck me , Bitiou —<stage>He looks long and sadly at him</stage>I pity you with all my heart — with all my heart .<stage>He dies</stage>Bitiou looks at the blood on the dagger , and flings it away in horror . Then he crouches down by Satni and begins to cry softly . DELETHI<stage>to Mieris</stage>Mistress , come and pray !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MIERIS</speaker>
       <p>No , I do not believe in gods in whose name men kill . Outside are heard the trumpets and acclamations that accompany Yaouma to the Nile .</p>

       <head type="scene">SCENE I :— A small reception-room in an old house at</head>
       <stage type="setting">
        <stage>Mauleon .</stage>
        <stage>The curtain rises , revealing Madame Vagret in evening dress ; she is altering the position of the chairs to her own satisfaction . Enter Bertha , also in evening dress , a newspaper in her hand .</stage>

        <lg>
         <l>Here 's the local paper , the Journal . I sent the Official</l>
         <l>Gazette to father ; he has just come home from the Court . He 's dressing .</l>
        </lg>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Is the sitting over ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BERTHA</speaker>
        <p>No , not yet . MADAME VAGRET<stage>taking the newspaper</stage>Are they still discussing the case ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BERTHA</speaker>
        <p>As usual .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>One does n't need to search long . There 's a big head-line at the top of the page : “ The Irissary Murder . ” They 're attacking your father now !<stage>She reads</stage>“ Monsieur Vagret , our District Attorney . ”<stage>She continues to read to herself</stage>And there are sub-headings too : “ The murderer still at large . ” As if that was our fault ! “ Justice asleep ! ” Justice asleep indeed ! How can they say such things when your father has n't closed his eyes for a fortnight ! Can they complain that he has n't done his duty ? Or that Monsieur Delorme , the examining magistrate , is n't doing his ? He has made himself quite ill , poor man ! Only the day before yesterday he had a tramp arrested because his movements were ever so little suspicious ! So you see ! No ! I tell you these journalists are crazy !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BERTHA</speaker>
        <p>It seems they are going to have an article in the Basque paper too .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>The Eskual Herria !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BERTHA</speaker>
        <p>So the chemist told me .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>I do n't care a sou for that . The Attorney-General does n't read it .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BERTHA</speaker>
        <p>On the contrary , father was saying the other day that the Attorney-General has translations sent him of every article dealing with the magistracy .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>The Attorney-General has translations sent him ! Oh well , never mind . Anyhow , let 's change the subject ! How many shall we be this evening ? You 've got the list ? BERTHA<stage>She takes the list from the over-mantel</stage>The President of Assizes — the President of the Court —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Yes . Yes , that 's all right ; nine in all , is n't it ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BERTHA</speaker>
        <p>Nine .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Nine ! To have nine people coming to dinner , and not to know the exact hour at which they 'll arrive ! That 's what 's so trying about these dinners we have to give at the end of a session — in honor of the President of Assizes . One dines when the Court rises . When the Court rises ! Well , we 'll await the good pleasure of these gentlemen !<stage>She sighs</stage>Well , child !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BERTHA</speaker>
        <p>Mother ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Are you still anxious to marry a magistrate ? BERTHA<stage>with conviction</stage>I am not !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>But you were two years ago !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BERTHA</speaker>
        <p>I am not now !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Look at us ! There 's your father . Procurator of the Republic — Public Prosecutor — State Attorney ; in a court of the third class , it 's true , because he 's not a wire-puller , because he has n't played the political game . And yet he 's a valuable man — no one can deny that . Since he 's been District Attorney he has secured three sentences of penal servitude for life ! And in a country like this , where crimes are so frightfully rare ! That 's pretty good , do n't you think ? Of course , I know he 'll have had three acquittals in the session that ends to-day . Granted . But that was mere bad luck . And for protecting society as he does — what do they pay him ? Have you any idea ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BERTHA</speaker>
        <p>Yes , I know ; you 've often told me , mother .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>And I 'll tell you again . Counting the stoppages for the pension , he gets altogether , and for everything , three hundred and ninety-five francs and eighty-three centimes a month . And then we are obliged to give a dinner for nine persons in honor of the President of Assizes , a Councillor ! Well , at all events , I suppose everything is ready ? Let 's see . My Revue des Deux Mondes — is it there ? Yes . And my armchair — is that in the right place ?<stage>She sits in it</stage>Yes .<stage>As though receiving a guest</stage>Pray be seated , Monsieur le Président . I hope that 's right . And Monsieur Dufour , who was an ordinary magistrate when your father was the same , when we were living at Castelnaudery , he 's now President of the second class at Douai , and he was only at Brest before he was promoted !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BERTHA</speaker>

         <l>Really !</l>

         <stage>searching for a book on the over-mantel</stage>
         <l>Look in the</l>

       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BERTHA</speaker>
        <p>I 'll take your word for it .</p>

        <p>You may ! The Judicial Year Book . I know it by heart !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BERTHA</speaker>
        <p>But then father may be appointed Councillor any day now .</p>

        </lg>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BERTHA</speaker>
        <p>But it 's as good as settled now . He was promised the first vacancy , and Monsieur Lefévre has just died .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>I hope to God you are right . If we fail this time , we 're done for . We shall be left at Mauleon until he 's pensioned off . What a misfortune it is that they can n't put their hands on that wretched murderer ! Such a beautiful crime too ! We really had some reason for hoping for a death sentence this time ! The first , remember !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BERTHA</speaker>
        <p>Do n't worry , motherkins . There 's still a chance .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>It 's easy for you to talk . You see the newspapers are beginning to grumble . They reproach us , they say we are slack . My dear child , you do n't realize — there ‘ s a question of sending a detective down from Paris ! It would be such a disgrace ! And everything promised so well ! You can n't imagine how excited your father was when they waked him up to tell him that an old man of eighty-seven had been murdered in his district ! He dressed himself in less than five minutes . He was very quiet about it . But he gripped my hands . “ I think , ” he said , “ I think we can count on my nomination this time ! ”<stage>She sighs</stage>And now everything is spoilt , and all through this ruffian who wo n't let them arrest him !<stage>Another sigh</stage>What 's the time ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BERTHA</speaker>
        <p>It has just struck six .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Write out the menus . Do n't forget . You must write only their titles — his Honor the President of Assizes , his Honor the President of the High Court of Mauleon , and so forth . It 's the preamble to the menu . Do n't forget . Here is your father . Go and take a look round the kitchen and appear as if you were busy .<stage>Bertha leaves the room . Vagret enters in evening dress</stage></p>

        <p>We have n't a chance .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>My dearest ! Come , come , you are wrong there . MADAME VAGRET<stage>still tearful</stage>My poor darling ! I know very well it is n't your fault ; you do your best . Your only failing is that you are too scrupulous , and I am not the one to reproach you for that . But what can you expect ? It 's no use talking ; everybody gets ahead of us . Soon you 'll be the oldest District Attorney in France .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Come , come ! Where 's the Year Book ? MADAME VAGRET<stage>still in the same tone</stage>It 's there — the dates , the length of service . See further on , dear . VAGRET<stage>throwing the Year Book aside</stage>Do n't cry like that ! Remember I 'm chosen to succeed Lefévre .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>I know that .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>I 'm on the list for promotion .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>So is everybody .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>And I have the Attorney-General 's definite promise — and the presiding judge 's too .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>It 's the deputy 's promise you ought to have .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>What ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Yes , the deputy 's . Up to now you 've waited for promotion to come to you . My dear , you 've got to run after it ! If you do n't do as the others do , you 'll simply get left behind .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>I am still an honest man .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>It is because you are an honest man that you ought to try to get a better appointment . If the able and independent magistrates allow the others to pass them by , what will become of the magistracy ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>There 's some truth in what you say .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>If , while remaining scrupulously honest , you can better our position by getting a deputy to push you , you are to blame if you do n't do so . After all , what do they ask you to do ? Merely that you should support the Ministry .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>I can do that honestly . Its opinions are my own .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Then you 'd better make haste — for a ministry does n't last long ! To support the Ministry is to support the Government — that is , the State — that is , Society . It 's to do your duty .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>You are ambitious .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>No , my dear — but we must think of the future . If you knew the trouble I have to make both ends meet ! We ought to get Bertha married . And the boys will cost us more and more as time goes on . And in our position we are bound to incur certain useless expenses which we could very well do without ; but we have to keep up appearances ; we have to “ keep up our position . ” We want Georges to enter the Polytechnique , and that 'll cost a lot of money . And Henri , if he 's going to study law — you 'd be able to help him on all the better if you held a better position . VAGRET<stage>after a brief silence</stage>I have n't told you everything .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>What is it ? VAGRET<stage>timidly</stage>Cortan has been appointed Councillor at Amiens . MADAME VAGRET<stage>exasperated</stage>Cortan ! That idiot of a Cortan ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Yes .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>This is too much !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>What can you expect ? The new Keeper of the Seals is in his department . You can n't fight against that !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>There 's always something — Cortan ! Wo n't she be making a show of herself — Madame Cortan — who spells “ indictment ” i-n-d-i-t-e ? She 'll be showing off her yellow hat ! Do n't you remember her famous yellow hat ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>No .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>It 's her husband who ought to wear that color !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Rosa , that 's unjust . MADAME VAGRET<stage>painfully excited</stage>I know it — but it does me good !</p>
       </sp>
       <stage>Enter Catialéna .</stage>
       <stage>CATIALÉNA . Madame , where shall I put the parcel we took from the linen-closet this morning ?</stage>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>What parcel ?</p>
       </sp>
       <stage>CATIALÉNA . The parcel — you know , Madame — when we were arranging the things in the linen-closet . MADAME VAGRET [ suddenly ] Oh — yes , yes . Take it to my room .</stage>
       <stage>CATIALÉNA . Where shall I put it there ?</stage>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Oh well , put it down here . I will put it away myself .</p>
       </sp>
       <stage>CATIALÉNA . Very good , Madame . [ She leaves the room ] MADAME VAGRET [ snipping at the parcel and speaking to herself ] It 's no use stuffing it with moth-balls — it 'll all be moth-eaten before ever you wear it .</stage>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>What is it ? MADAME VAGRET<stage>placing the parcel on the table and opening the wrapper</stage>Look !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Ah , yes — my red robe — the one you bought for me — in advance — two years ago .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Yes . That time it was Gamard who was appointed instead of you .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>What could you expect ? Gamard had a deputy for his brother-in-law ; there 's no getting over that . The Ministry has to assure itself of a majority .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>And to think that in spite of all my searching I have n't been able to discover so much as a municipal councillor among our relations !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Well — hide this thing . It torments me .<stage>He returns the gown , which he had unfolded , to his wife</stage>In any case I dare say it would n't fit me now .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Oh , they fit anybody , these things !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Let 's see —<stage>He takes off his coat</stage></p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>And it means a thousand francs more a year !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>It is n't faded .<stage>At this moment Bertha enters . Vagret hides the red gown</stage>What is it ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BERTHA</speaker>
        <p>It 's only me .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>You startled me . BERTHA<stage>catching sight of the gown</stage>You 've been appointed ! You 've been appointed !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Do be quiet ! Turn the key in the door !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BERTHA</speaker>
        <p>Papa has been appointed !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Do as you 're told ! No , he has n't been appointed .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>It 's really as good as new .<stage>He slips it on</stage></p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Well , I should hope so ! I took care to get the very best silk .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Ah , if I could only wear this on my back when I 'm demanding the conviction of the Irissary murderer ! Say what you like , the man who devised this costume was no fool ! It 's this sort of thing that impresses the jury . And the prisoner too ! I 've seen him unable to tear his eyes from the gown of the State Attorney ! And you feel a stronger man when you wear it . It gives one a better presence , and one 's gestures are more dignified : “ Gentlemen of the court , gentlemen of the jury ! ” Could n't I make an impressive indictment ? “ Gentlemen of the court , gentlemen of the jury ! In the name of society , of which I am the avenging voice — in the name of the sacred interests of humanity — in the name of the eternal principles of morality — fortified by the consciousness of my duty and my right — I rise —<stage>He repeats his gesture</stage>I rise to demand the head of the wretched man who stands before you ! ”</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>How well you speak ! Vagret , with a shrug of the shoulders and a sigh , slowly and silently removes the gown and hands it to his wife .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Here — put it away .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>There 's the bell .</p>

        <speaker>DELORME</speaker>
        <p>No .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Well , then ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>DELORME</speaker>
        <p>Well , I beg you to give the brief to someone else .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Is that final ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>DELORME</speaker>
        <p>Yes . You see , my dear fellow , I 'm too old to adapt myself to the customs of the day . I 'm a magistrate of the old school , just as you are . I inherited from my father certain scruples which are no longer the fashion . These daily attacks in the press get on my nerves .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>They would cease at the news of an arrest .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>DELORME</speaker>
        <p>Precisely . I should end by doing something foolish . Well , I have done something foolish already . I should not have arrested that man if I had not been badgered as I was .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>He was a tramp . You gave him shelter for a few days . There 's no great harm done there .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>DELORME</speaker>
        <p>All the same —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>You let yourself be too easily discouraged . To-night or to-morrow something may turn up to put you on a new scent .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>DELORME</speaker>
        <p>Even then — Do you know what they are saying ? They are saying that Maître Plaçat , the Bordeaux advocate , is coming to defend the prisoner .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>I do n't see what he has to gain by that .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>DELORME</speaker>
        <p>He wants to come forward at the next election in our arrondissement — and he counts on attacking certain persons in his plea , so as to gain a little popularity .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>How can that affect you ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>DELORME</speaker>
        <p>Why , he can be present at all the interrogations of the accused . The law allows it — and as he is ravenous for publicity , he would tell the newspapers just what he pleased , and if my proceedings did n't suit him , I 'd be vilified in the papers day after day .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>You are exaggerating .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>DELORME</speaker>
        <p>I 'm not . Nowadays an examination takes place in the market-place or the editorial offices of the newspapers rather than in the magistrate 's office .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>That is true where notorious criminals are concerned . In reality the new law benefits them and them only — you know as well as I do that for the general run of accused persons —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>DELORME</speaker>
        <p>Seriously , I beg you to take the brief back .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Come ! You can n't imagine that Maître Plaçat , who has a hundred cases to plead , can be present at all your interrogations . You know what usually happens . He 'll send some little secretary — if he sends anyone .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>DELORME</speaker>
        <p>I beg you not to insist , my dear Vagret . My decision is irrevocable .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Then —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>DELORME</speaker>
        <p>Allow me to take my leave . I do n't want to meet my colleagues who are dining with you .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Then I 'll see you to-morrow . I 'm sorry —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>DELORME</speaker>
        <p>Good-night . He goes out . Madame Vagret at once enters by another door .</p>

        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>He will be a little late . He wants to get away early to-morrow morning , and he has a mass of documents to sign . You must remember the Court has barely risen . When we saw that we should be sitting so late we sent for our evening clothes , and we changed while the jury was deliberating ; then we put our robes on over them to pronounce sentence .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>

       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>Now , my dear Madame Vagret , you must n't worry yourself . She leads her up the stage . BUNERAT<stage>to Vagret</stage>Yes , my dear colleague , an acquittal . That makes three this session . MOUZON<stage>a man of forty , whiskered and foppish</stage>Three prisoners whom we have had to set at liberty because we could n't hold them for other causes .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>

        <p>A regular run on the black ! LA BOUZOLE<stage>a man of seventy</stage>My dear colleagues would prefer a run on the red .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>La Bouzole , you are a cynic ! I do not understand how you can have the courage to joke on such a subject .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>I should n't joke if your prisoners were condemned .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>I 'm not thinking of our prisoners — I 'm thinking of ourselves . If you imagine we shall receive the congratulations of the Chancellery , you are mistaken .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>He does n't care a straw if the Mauleon Court does earn a black mark in Paris .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>You have said it , Bunerat ; I do n't care a straw ! I have nothing more to look for . I shall be seventy years old next week , and I retire automatically . Nothing more to hope for ; I have a right to judge matters according to my own conscience . I 'm out of school !<stage>He gives a little skip</stage>Do n't get your backs up — I 've done — I see the Year Book over there ; I 'm going to look out the dates of the coming vacation for you .<stage>He takes a seat to the left</stage></p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>Well , there it is .<stage>To Vagret</stage>The President of Assizes is furious .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>It wo n't do him any good either .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>And my substitute ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>You may well say “ your substitute ” !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>It 's all his fault . He pleaded extenuating circumstances . He !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>Where does the idiot hail from ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>He 's far from being an idiot , I assure you . He was secretary to the Conference in Paris ; he is a doctor of laws and full of talent .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>Talent !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>I assure you he has a real talent for speaking .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>So we observed .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>He 's a very distinguished young fellow . BUNERAT<stage>with emphasis</stage>Well ! When a man has such talent as that he becomes an advocate ; he does n't enter the magistracy . MADAME VAGRET<stage>to La Bouzole , who approaches her</stage>So really , Monsieur La Bouzole , it seems it 's the fault of the new substitute .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>Tell us all about it .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>It was like this .<stage>He turns towards the ladies and continues in a low tone . Bertha , who has entered the room , joins the group , of which Vagret also forms one</stage>MOUZON<stage>to Bunerat</stage>All this wo n't hasten our poor Vagret 's nomination . BUNERAT<stage>smiling</stage>The fact is he has n't a chance at the present moment , poor chap !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Is it true that they were really seriously thinking of him when there is a certain other magistrate in the same court ? BUNERAT<stage>with false modesty</stage>I do n't think I — Of whom are you speaking ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Of yourself , my dear President .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>They have indeed mentioned my name at the Ministry .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>When you preside at Assizes the proceedings will be far more interesting than they are at present .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>Now how can you tell that , my dear Mouzon ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Because I have seen you preside over the Correctional Court .<stage>He laughs</stage></p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>Why do you laugh ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>I just remembered that witty remark of yours the other day . BUNERAT<stage>delighted</stage>I do n't recall it .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>It really was very witty !<stage>He laughs</stage></p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>What was it ? Did I say anything witty ? I do n't remember .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Anything ? A dozen things — a score . You were in form that day ! What a figure he cut — the prisoner . You know , the fellow who was so badly dressed . Cock his name was .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>Ah , yes ! When I said : “ Cock , turn yourself on and let your confession trickle out ! ” MOUZON<stage>laughing</stage>That was it ! That was it ! And the witness for the defence — that idiot . Did n't you make him look a fool ? He could n't finish his evidence , they laughed so when you said : “ If you wish to conduct the case , only say so . Perhaps you 'd like to take my place ? ”</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>Ah , yes ! Ladies , my good friend here reminds me of a rather amusing anecdote . The other day — it was in the Correctional Court — THE MANSERVANT<stage>announcing</stage>Monsieur Gabriel Ardeuil .</p>
       </sp>
      </div>
      <div type="scene" n="6">
       <head type="scene">SCENE VI :— The same , with Ardeuil .</head>
       <stage type="setting">
        <stage>ARDEUIL [ to Madame Vagret ] I hope you 'll forgive me for coming so late . I was detained until now .</stage>
       </stage>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>I will forgive you all the more readily since I 'm told you have had such a success to-day as will make all the advocates of the district jealous of you . Ardeuil is left to himself . LA BOUZOLE<stage>touching him on the shoulder</stage>Young man — come , sit down by me — as a favor . Do you realize that it wo n't take many trials like to-day 's to get you struck off the rolls ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ARDEUIL</speaker>
        <p>I could n't be struck off the rolls because —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>Hang it all — a man does himself no good by appearing singular .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ARDEUIL</speaker>
        <p>Singular ! But you yourself — Well , the deliberations are secret , but for all that I know you stand for independence and goodness of heart in this Court .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>Yes , I 've permitted myself that luxury — lately .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ARDEUIL</speaker>
        <p>Lately ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>Yes , yes , my young friend , for some little time . Because for some little time I 've been cured of the disease which turns so many honest fellows into bad magistrates . That disease is the fever of promotion . Look at those men there . If they were n't infected by this microbe , they would be just , kindly gentlemen , instead of cruel and servile magistrates .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ARDEUIL</speaker>
        <p>You exaggerate , sir . The French magistracy is not —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>It is not venal — that 's the truth . Among our four thousand magistrates you might perhaps not find one — you hear me , not one — even among the poorest and most obscure — who would accept a money bribe in order to modify his judgment . That is the glory of our country 's magistracy and its special virtue . But a great number of our magistrates are ready to be complaisant — even to give way — when it is a question of making themselves agreeable to an influential elector , or to the deputy , or to the minister who distributes appointments and favors . Universal suffrage is the god and the tyrant of the magistrate . So you are right — and I am not wrong .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ARDEUIL</speaker>
        <p>Nothing can deprive us of our independence .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>That is so . But , as Monsieur de Tocqueville once remarked , we can offer it up as a sacrifice .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ARDEUIL</speaker>
        <p>You are a misanthrope . There are magistrates whom no promise of any kind —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>Yes , there are . Those who are not needy or who have no ambitions . Yes , there are obscure persons who devote their whole lives to their professions and who never ask for anything for themselves . But you can take my word for it that they are the exceptions , and that our Court of Mauleon , which you yourself have seen , represents about the average of our judicial morality . I exaggerate , you think ? Well ! Let us suppose that in all France there are only fifty Courts like this . Suppose there are only twenty — suppose there is only one . It is still one too many ! Why , my young friend , what sort of an idea have you got of the magistracy ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ARDEUIL</speaker>
        <p>It frightens me .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>You are speaking seriously ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ARDEUIL</speaker>
        <p>Certainly .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>Then why did you become a substitute ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ARDEUIL</speaker>

        </lg>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Three acquittals — and the Irissary murder . A deplorable record ! A pretty pickle we 're in .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>You know , my dear Vagret , I 'm a plain speaker . No shilly-shallying about me . When I hunt the boar I charge right down on him . I speak plainly — anyone can know what 's in my mind . I 'm the son of a peasant , I am , and I make no bones about it . Well , it seems to me that your Bar — I know , of course , that you lead it with distinguished integrity and honesty — but it seems to me — how shall I put it ?— that it 's getting weak . Mouzon , you will remember , said the same thing when he was consulting the statistics .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>It really is a very bad year .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>You know it was a question of making ourselves an exception to the general rule — of getting our Court raised to a higher class . Well , Mauleon wo n't be raised from the third class to the second if the number of causes diminishes .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>We should have to prove that we had been extremely busy .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>And many of the cases you settled by arrangement might well have been the subject of proceedings .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Just reflect that this year we have awarded a hundred and eighteen years less imprisonment than we did last year !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>And yet the Court has not been to blame . We safeguard the interests of society with the greatest vigilance .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>But before we can punish you must give us prisoners .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>I have recently issued the strictest orders respecting the repression of smuggling offences , which are so common in these parts .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>Well , that 's something . You understand the point of view we take . It 's a question of the safety of the public , my dear fellow .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>We are falling behind other Courts of the same class . See , I 've worked out the figures .<stage>He takes a paper from his pocket-book and accidentally drops other papers , which La Bouzole picks up</stage>I see —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>You are dropping your papers , Mouzon . Is this yours — this envelope ?<stage>He reads</stage>“ Monsieur Benoît , Officer of the Navy , Railway Hotel , Bordeaux . ” A nice scent — MOUZON<stage>flurried , taking the letter from La Bouzole</stage>Yes — a letter belonging to a friend of mine .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>And this ? The Irissary murder ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Ah , yes — it 's — I was going to explain — it 's — oh , the Irissary murder , yes — it 's the translation Bunerat gave me of the article which appeared in the Eskual Herria to-day . It is extremely unpleasant . They say Mauleon is a sort of penal Court — something like a Biribi of the magistracy .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>But , after all , I can n't invent a murderer for you just because the fellow is so pig-headed that he wo n't allow himself to be taken ! Delorme has sent the description they gave us to the offices of all the magistrates .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Delorme ! Shall I tell you what I think ? Well , our colleague Delorme is making a mistake in sticking to the idea that the criminal is a tramp .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>But there is a witness .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>The witness is lying , or he 's mistaken .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>A witness who saw gipsies leaving the victim 's house that morning .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>I repeat , the witness is lying , or he is mistaken .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Why so ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>I 'm certain of it .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>Why ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Because I 'm certain the murderer was n't a gipsy .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>But explain —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <lg>
         <l>It 's of no use , my dear friend . I know my duty to my colleague</l>
         <l>Delorme too well to insist . I 've said too much already .</l>
        </lg>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Not at all .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>By no means .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>It was with the greatest delicacy that I warned our colleague Delorme — he was good enough to consult me and show me day by day the information which he had elicited — I warned him that he was on a false scent . He would listen to nothing ; he persisted in searching for his tramp . Well , let him search ! There are fifty thousand tramps in France . After all , I am probably wrong . Yet I should be surprised , for in the big towns in which I have served as magistrate , and in which I found myself confronted , not merely now and again , but every day , so to speak , with difficulties of this sort , I was able to acquire a certain practice in criminal cases and a certain degree of perspicacity .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Obviously . As for Delorme , it is the first time he has had to deal with such a big crime .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>In the case of that pretty woman from Toulouse , at Bordeaux , a case which made a good deal of stir at the time , it was I who forced the accused to make the confession that led her to the guillotine . BUNERAT<stage>admiringly</stage>Was it really ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>My dear friend , I ask you most seriously — and if I am insistent , it is because I have reasons for being so — between ourselves , I beg you to tell us on what you base your opinion .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Well , I do n't want to hide my light under a bushel — I 'll tell you .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>We are listening .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Recall the facts . In a house isolated as are most of our Basque houses they find , one morning , an old man of eighty-seven murdered in his bed . Servants who slept in the adjacent building had heard nothing . The dogs did not bark . There was robbery , it is true , but the criminal did not confine himself to stealing hard cash ; he stole family papers as well . Remember that point . And I will call your attention to another detail . It had rained on the previous evening . In the garden footprints were discovered which were immediately attributed to the murderer , who was so badly shod that the big toe of his right foot protruded from his boot . Monsieur Delorme proceeds along the trail ; he obtains a piece of evidence that encourages him , and he declares that the murderer is a vagrant . I say this is a mistake . The murderer is not a vagrant . Now the house in which the crime was committed is an isolated house , and we know that within a radius of six to ten miles there was no tramp begging before the crime . So this tramp , if there was one , would have eaten and drunk on the scene of the crime , either before or after striking the blow . Now no traces have been discovered which permit us to suppose that he did anything of the kind . So — here is a man who arrives in a state of exhaustion . He begs ; he is refused . He then hides himself , and , when it is night , he robs and assassinates . There is wine and bread and other food at hand ; but he goes his way without touching them . Is this probable ? No . Do n't tell me that he was disturbed and so ran off ; it is not true ; their own witness declares that he saw him in the morning , a few yards from the house , whereas the crime was committed before midnight . If Monsieur Delorme , in addition to his distinguished qualities , had a little experience of cases of this kind , he would realize that empty bottles , dirty glasses , and scraps of food left on the table constitute , so to speak , the sign manual which the criminal vagrant leaves behind him on the scene of his crime .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>True ; I was familiar with that detail . LA BOUZOLE<stage>under his breath to Ardeuil</stage>That fellow would send a man to the scaffold for the sake of seeming to know something .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Go on — go on .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Monsieur Delorme ought to have known this also : in the life of the vagrant there is one necessity which comes next to hunger and thirst — it is the need of footwear . This is so true that they have sometimes been known to make this need a pretext for demanding an appeal , because the journey to the Court of Appeal is generally made on foot , so that the administration is obliged to furnish shoes , and , as these are scarcely worn during the period of detention , they are in good condition when the man leaves prison . Now the supposed vagrant has a foot very nearly the same size as that of his victim . He has — you yourself have told us — boots which are in a very bad condition . Well , gentlemen , this badly shod vagrant does not take the good strong boots which are in the house ! I will add but one word more . If the crime had been committed by a passing stranger — by a professional mendicant — will you tell me why this remarkable murderer follows the road which passes in front of the victim 's house — a road on which he would find no resources — a road on which houses are met with only at intervals of two or three miles — when there is , close at hand , another road which runs through various villages and passes numbers of farmhouses , in which it is a tradition never to refuse hospitality to one of his kind ? One word more . Why does this vagrant steal family papers which will betray him as the criminal the very first time he comes into contact with the police ? No , gentlemen , the criminal is not a vagrant . If you want to find him , you must not look for a man wandering along the highway ; you must look for him among those relatives or debtors or friends , who had an interest in his death .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>This is very true .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>I call that admirably logical and extremely lucid .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Believe me , the matter is quite simple . If I were intrusted with the examination , I guarantee that within three days the criminal would be under lock and key .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Well , my dear colleague , I have a piece of news for you . Monsieur Delorme , who is very unwell , has returned me his brief this afternoon , and it will be intrusted to you . Henceforth the preliminary examination of the Irissary murder will be in your hands .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>I have only to say that I accept . My duty is to obey . I withdraw nothing of what I have said ; within three days the murderer will be arrested .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>Bravo !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>

        <p>I thank you for that promise in the name of all concerned . I declare that you relieve us of a great anxiety .<stage>To his wife</stage>Listen , my dear . Monsieur Mouzon is undertaking the preliminary examination , and he promises us a result before three days are up .</p>

       <sp>

        <p>We shall be grateful , Monsieur Mouzon .</p>

        <stage>MONDOUBLEAU [ speaking with a strong provincial accent ] I was passing the Law Courts , and I thought I 'd look in and say how do . I am not disturbing you , I hope ?</stage>
        <stage>MOUZON [ smiling and closing his brief ] My dear deputy , an examining magistrate , as you know , is always busy . But it gives one a rest — it does one good — to see a welcome caller once in a while . Sit down , I beg you . Yes , please !</stage>
       </stage>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>I can stop only a minute .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>But that 's unkind of you !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>Well , what 's the latest about the Irissary murder ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>So far there 's nothing new . I 've questioned the accused — an ugly-looking fellow and a poor defence . He simply denied everything and flew into a temper . I had to send him back to the cells without getting anything out of him .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>Are you perfectly sure you 've got the right man ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Certain — no ; but I should be greatly surprised if I were mistaken .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>I saw Monsieur Delorme yesterday . He 's a little better .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>So I hear . He thinks the murderer was a tramp . Now there , my dear sir , is one of the peculiarities to which we examining magistrates are subject . We always find it the very devil to abandon the first idea that pops into our minds . Personally I do my best to avoid what is really a professional failing . I am just going to examine Etchepare , and I am waiting for the results of a police inquiry . If all this gives me no result , I shall set the man at liberty and look elsewhere for the culprit — but I repeat , I firmly believe I am on the right scent .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>Monsieur Delorme is a magistrate of long experience and a very shrewd one , and I will not deny that the reasons he has given me are —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>I know my colleague is extremely intelligent . And , once more , I do n't say that he 's wrong . We shall see . At present I am only morally certain . I shall be materially certain when I know the antecedents of the accused and have established an obvious motive for his action . At the moment of your arrival I was about to open my mail . Here is a letter from the Court of Pau ; it gives our man 's judicial record .<stage>He takes a paper-knife in order to open the envelope</stage></p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>A curious paper-knife .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>That ? It 's the blade of the knife that brought the pretty Toulouse woman to the guillotine at Bordeaux . Pretty weapon , eh ? I had it made into a paper-knife .<stage>He opens the envelope</stage>There — there you are ! Four times sentenced for assaulting and wounding . You see —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>Really , really ! Four times !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>This is getting interesting . Besides this — I have neglected nothing — I have learned that his wife , Yanetta Etchepare —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>Is that the young woman I saw in the corridor just now ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>I have called her as witness . I shall be hearing her directly .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>She looks a very respectable woman .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Possibly . But , as I was about to tell you , I have learned that she used to live in Paris — before her marriage — I have written asking for information . Here we are .<stage>He opens the envelope and smiles</stage>Aha ! Well , this young woman who looks so respectable was sentenced to one month 's imprisonment for receiving stolen goods . Now we will hear the police lieutenant who is coming , very obligingly , to give me an account of the inquiry with which I intrusted him , and which he will put in writing this evening . I shall soon see —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>Do you suppose he will have anything new for you ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Does this interest you ? I will see him in your presence .<stage>He goes to the door and makes a sign . He returns to his chair</stage>Understand , I assert nothing . It is quite possible that my colleague 's judgment has been more correct than mine .<stage>The officer enters</stage></p>

       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
        <p>You will see . In the first place there have been four convictions already .</p>

       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
        <p>Then fifteen years ago he bought , from Daddy Goyetche , the victim , a vineyard , the payment taking the form of a life annuity .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Well !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
        <p>He professed to have made a very bad bargain , and he used to abuse old Goyetche as a swindler .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Excellent !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
        <p>Five years ago he sold this vineyard .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>So that for five years he has been paying an annuity to the victim , although the vineyard was no longer his property .</p>

        <p>That 's always the way .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
        <p>I have heard a witness , the girl Gracieuse Mendione , to whom Etchepare used the words , “ It is really too stupid to be forced to pay money to that old swine . ”</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>

       <sp>
        <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
        <p>Etchepare told him , about two months ago , in speaking of old Goyetche , “ It 's more than one can stand — the Almighty 's forgotten him . ” MOUZON<stage>writing</stage>“ The Almighty has forgotten him . ” Excellent . Is this all you can tell me ?</p>

        <p>A week after Ascension Day .</p>

        <p>Yes , your worship . MOUZON<stage>to Mondoubleau</stage>Singular coincidence !<stage>To the officer</stage>Was he comfortably off , this Etchepare ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
        <p>He was pressed for money . Three months ago he borrowed eight hundred francs from a Mauleon cattle-dealer .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>And what do the neighbors say ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
        <p>They say Etchepare was a sly grasping fellow , and they are n't surprised to hear that he 's the murderer . All the same , they all speak very highly of the woman Yanetta Etchepare . They say she is a model mother and housekeeper .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>How many children ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
        <p>Two — Georges and — I can n't remember the name of the other now .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>And the woman 's moral character ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
        <p>Irreproachable .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Good .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
        <p>I was forgetting . One of my men , one of those who effected the arrest , informs me that when Etchepare saw him coming he said to his wife , “ They 've got me . ”</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>“ They 've got me . ” That is rather important .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
        <p>And then he told his wife , in Basque , “ Do n't for the world let out that I left the house last night ! ”</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>He said this before the gendarme ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
        <p>No , your worship — the gendarme was outside — close to an open window . Etchepare did n't see him .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>You will have him cited as witness .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
        <p>Yes , your worship . Then there 's that witness for the defence too — Bridet .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Ah , yes — I have read the deposition he made in your presence . It 's of no importance . Still , if he 's there I 'll hear him . Thank you . Well , draw up a report for me , in full detail , and make them give you the summonses for the witnesses .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
        <p>Yes , your worship .<stage>He salutes and goes out</stage></p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>Monsieur Delorme is a fool . MOUZON<stage>laughing</stage>Well , I do n't say so , my dear deputy .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>It 's wonderful , your faculty of divination .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Wonderful — no , no . I assure you —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>Now how did you come to suspect this Etchepare ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Well , you know , it is partly a matter of temperament . The searching for a criminal is an art . I may say that a good examining magistrate is guided less by the facts themselves than by a kind of inspiration .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>Wonderful . I repeat it 's wonderful . And this witness for the defence ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>He may be a false witness .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>What makes you think that ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Because he accuses the gipsies ! Moreover , he had business dealings with Etchepare . The Basque , you know , still look on us rather as enemies , as conquerors , and they think it no crime to deceive us by means of a false oath .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>Then you were never inclined to accept the theory of your predecessor ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Tramps — the poor wretches ! I know what an affection you have for the poor , and I feel with you that one should not confine oneself to suspecting the unfortunate — people without shelter , without bread even .</p>

        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>What can you expect , my dear sir ? The paper is hostile to you , and as I do not scruple openly to support your candidature they make the magistrate pay for the opinions of the citizen .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>I feel ashamed — and I thank you with all my heart , my dear fellow . Go on as you are doing — but be prudent — eh ? The Keeper of the Seals was saying to me only a couple of days ago , “ I look to you to see that there is no trouble in your constituency . No trouble — above all no scandal of any kind ! ” I ought to tell you that Eugène is the subject of many attacks at the present moment .</p>

        <p>Au revoir .<stage>The deputy goes out . Mouzon is alone</stage>I do n't think our deputy is getting such a bad idea of me .<stage>Smiling</stage>The fact is it was really clever of me to suspect Etchepare . Now the thing is to make him confess the whole business , and as quickly as possible — The doorkeeper enters , a telegram in his hand .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>

        <p>Just now one could n't keep you quiet ; now when I ask you to speak you have nothing to say . What interest have you in defending Etchepare ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BRIDET</speaker>
        <p>What interest ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Yes . Do n't you understand your own language ?</p>

        <p>Yes , Monsieur . Why , no interest .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>No interest ? Is that the truth ? Eh ? None ? Come , I want very much to believe you .<stage>Very sternly</stage>However , I remind you that Article 361 of the Penal Code punishes false evidence with imprisonment . Now that you know the risk you run in not telling the truth I will listen to you . BRIDET<stage>confused</stage>I was going to say that old Goyetche was murdered by gipsies who came from over the frontier , down the mountain .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>You are sure of that ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BRIDET</speaker>
        <p>I believe it 's so .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>You are not here to say what you believe . Tell me what you saw or heard . That is all that 's asked of you .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BRIDET</speaker>
        <p>But one 's always meeting them , these gipsies . The other day they robbed a tobacconist 's shop . There were three of them . Two of them went inside . I must tell you they had looked the place over during the day —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>

        <p>No , Monsieur .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>That 's as well , for such a thing wo n't answer — you understand ? Do you hear ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BRIDET</speaker>
        <p>Yes , Monsieur .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Is that all you have to say ?</p>

        <speaker>BRIDET</speaker>
        <p>No , Monsieur .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Well , then , go on ! Confound it ! Do n't waste my time in this way ! Do you think I 've nothing to do but listen to your gossip ? Come now , tell me .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BRIDET</speaker>
        <p>Well , the day after Ascension Day — that is , on the Monday — no , on the Friday —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Was it Monday or Friday ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BRIDET</speaker>
        <p>Friday — it was like a Monday , you see , because it was the day after the holiday . Well , the day they found old Goyetche murdered I saw a troop of gipsies leaving his house .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Then you were quite close to the house ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BRIDET</speaker>
        <p>No , I was passing on the road .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Did they close the door behind them ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BRIDET</speaker>
        <p>I do n't know , Monsieur .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Then why do you say you saw them come out of the house ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BRIDET</speaker>
        <p>I saw them come out of the meadow in front of the house .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>And then ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BRIDET</speaker>
        <p>That 's all . MOUZON<stage>throwing himself back in his chair</stage>And you 've come here to bother me for this , eh ? Answer . For this ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BRIDET</speaker>
        <p>But , your worship — I beg your pardon — I thought — I beg your pardon —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Listen . How many gipsies were there ? Think well . Do n't make a mistake .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BRIDET</speaker>
        <p>Five .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Are you certain of that ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BRIDET</speaker>
        <p>Yes , Monsieur .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Yes . Well , in the presence of the gendarmes you said there were five or six . So you are more certain of a fact at the end of a month than you were on the day on which you observed it . On the other hand , you no longer know whether the fact occurred on a Monday or a Friday , nor whether the gipsies were leaving the house or merely crossing the fields .<stage>Sternly</stage>Tell me , are you acquainted with the accused ? Etchepare — do you know him ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BRIDET</speaker>
        <p>Yes , Monsieur .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>You have business relations with him ? You used to sell him sheep ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BRIDET</speaker>
        <p>Yes , Monsieur .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>That 's enough for me . Get out !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BRIDET</speaker>
        <p>Yes , Monsieur .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>And think yourself lucky that I let you go like this .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BRIDET</speaker>
        <p>Yes , Monsieur .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>In future , before asking to be heard as a witness for the defence in a trial at law , I recommend you to think twice .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BRIDET</speaker>
        <p>Rest your mind easy , Monsieur . I swear they 'll never get me again !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Sign your interrogatory and be off . If there were not so many easy-going blunderers of your sort , there would be less occasion to complain of the law 's delays and hesitations for which the law itself is not responsible .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BRIDET</speaker>
        <p>Yes , Monsieur . MOUZON<stage>to the recorder</stage>Send for Etchepare . RECORDER<stage>returning immediately</stage>Your worship .</p>

        <p>Yes , your honor . He would like to see you before the interrogatory .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Well , show him in , then ! What are you waiting for ? Be off — and come back when I send for the accused . The recorder goes out as Plaçat enters .</p>

Before me , Mouzon , examining magistrate , in the presence of — and so on — the Sieur Etchepare Jean-Pierre was brought to our office , his first appearance being recorded in the report of — and so on . We may mention that the accused , having consented to interrogation in the absence of his advocate —<stage>To Etchepare</stage>You do consent , do n't you ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>I am innocent . I do n't need any advocate . MOUZON<stage>resumes his stuttering</stage>We dispensed therewith . In consequence of which we have immediately proceeded as below to the interrogation of the said Sieur Etchepare Jean-Pierre .<stage>To Etchepare</stage>Etchepare , on the occasion of your first appearance you refused to reply , which was n't perhaps very sensible of you , but you were within your rights . You lost your temper and I was even obliged to remind you of the respect due to the law . Are you going to speak to-day ? ETCHEPARE<stage>disturbed</stage>Yes , your worship .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>

        <p>No . I 've been thinking . I want to get out of this as quickly as possible .</p>

        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Well , well , for my part , I ask nothing more than to be able to set you at liberty . So far we understand each other excellently . Let us hope it 'll last . Sit down . And first of all I advise you to give up trying to father the crime onto a band of gipsies . The witness Bridet , who has business relations with you , has endeavored , no doubt at your instigation , to induce us to accept this fable . I warn you he has not succeeded .</p>

        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Oh , really ! I thought you had to pay him a life annuity . ETCHEPARE<stage>after a moment 's hesitation</stage>Yes , Monsieur .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Then you had an interest in his death ?<stage>Silence</stage>Eh ! You do n't answer ? Well , let us continue . You said to a witness , the young woman — the young woman Gracieuse Mendione — “ It is really too stupid to be forced to pay money to that old swine . ” ETCHEPARE<stage>without conviction</stage>That 's not true .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>It 's not true ! So the witness is a liar , eh ?</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>I do n't know .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>You do n't know .<stage>A pause</stage>You thought that Goyetche had lived too long ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>No , Monsieur .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>No , Monsieur . Then why did you say to another witness , Piarrech Artola , why did you say , in speaking of your creditor , “ It 's too much , the Almighty has forgotten him ” ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>I did n't say that .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>You did n't say that . So this witness is a liar too ! Answer me . Is he a liar ?<stage>Silence</stage>You do n't answer . It 's just as well . Come now , Etchepare , why do you persist in these denials — eh ? Is n't it all plain enough ? You are avaricious , interested , greedy for gain —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>It 's so hard to make a living .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>You are a man of violent temper — from time to time you get drunk , and then you become dangerous . You have been four times convicted for assault and wounding — you are over-ready with your knife . Is that the truth or is n't it ? You were tired of paying — for nothing — a biggish annual sum to this old man . The time for payment was approaching ; you were pressed for money ; you felt that Goyetche had lived too long , and you killed him . It 's so obvious — eh ? Is n't it true ? ETCHEPARE<stage>gradually recovering himself</stage>I did not murder him .</p>

        <p>We wo n't juggle with words . Did you pay anyone else to kill him ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>I had nothing to do with his death . You yourself say I was pressed for money . So how could I have paid anyone to kill him ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Then you did it yourself .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>That 's a lie .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Listen , Etchepare — you will confess sooner or later . Already you are weakening in your defence .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>If I was to shout , you 'd say I was play-acting .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>I tell you sooner or later you will change your tune . Already you admit facts which constitute a serious charge against you .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>That 's true ; I said it without thinking of the consequences .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Ah , but you ought to think of the consequences ; for they may be peculiarly serious for you .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>I 'm not afraid of death .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>The death of others —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>Nor my own .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>So much the better . But you are a Basque ; you are a Catholic . After death there is hell .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>I 'm not afraid of hell ; I 've done nothing wrong .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>There is the dishonor that will fall on your children . You love your children , do you not ? Eh ? They will ask after you — they love you — because they do n't know — yet — ETCHEPARE<stage>suddenly weeping</stage>My poor little children ! My poor little children !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Come , then ! All good feeling is n't extinct in you . Believe me , Etchepare , the jury will be touched by your confession , by your repentance — you will escape the supreme penalty . You are still young — you have long years before you in which to expiate your crime . You may earn your pardon and perhaps you may once again see those children , who will have forgiven you . Believe me — believe me — in your own interests even , confess !<stage>Mouzon has approached Etchepare during the foregoing ; he places his hands on the latter 's shoulders ; he continues , with great gentleness</stage>Come , is n't it true ? If you can n't speak , you 've only to nod your head . Eh ? It 's true ? Come , since I know it 's true . Eh ? I can n't hear what you say . It was you , was n't it ? It was you ! ETCHEPARE<stage>still weeping</stage>It was not me , sir ! I swear it was not me ! I swear it ! MOUZON<stage>in a hard voice , going back to his desk</stage>Oh , you need n't swear . You have only to tell me the truth .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>I am telling the truth — I am — I can n't say I did it when I did n't !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Come , come ! We shall get nothing out of you to-day .<stage>To the recorder</stage>Read him his interrogatory and let him be taken back to his cell . One minute — Etchepare !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>Monsieur ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>There is one way to prove your innocence , since you profess to be innocent . Prove , in one way or another , that you were elsewhere than at Irissary on the night of the crime , and I will set you at liberty . Where were you ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>Where was I ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>I ask you where you were on the night of Ascension Day . Were you at home ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>Yes .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Is that really the truth ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>Yes . MOUZON<stage>rising , rather theatrically , pointing at Etchepare</stage>Now , Etchepare , that condemns you . I know that you went out that night . When you were arrested you said to your wife , “ Do n't for the world admit that I went out last night . ” Come , I must tell you everything . Someone saw you — a servant . She told the gendarmes that as she was saying good-night to a young man from Iholdy , with whom she had been dancing , at ten o'clock at night , she saw you a few hundred yards from your house . What have you to say to that ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>It is true — I did go out . MOUZON<stage>triumphantly</stage>Ah ! Now , my good man , we 've had some trouble in getting you to say something . But I can read it in your face when you are lying — I can read it in your face in letters as big as that . The proof is that there was no witness who saw you go out — neither your servant nor anyone else ; and yet I would have sworn to it with my head under the knife . Come , we have made a little progress now .<stage>To the recorder</stage>Have you put down carefully his first admission ? Good .<stage>To Etchepare</stage>Now think for a moment . We will continue our little conversation .<stage>He goes towards the fireplace , rubbing his hands , pours himself a glass of spirits , swallows it , gives a sigh of gratification , and returns to his chair</stage>FIRST GENDARME<stage>to his comrade</stage>A cunning one , he is !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>SECOND GENDARME</speaker>
        <p>You 're right !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Let us continue . Come , now that you 've got so far , confess the whole thing ! Here are these good gendarmes who want to go to their grub .<stage>The gendarmes , the recorder , and Mouzon laugh</stage>You confess ? No ? Then tell me , why did you insist on saying that you remained at home that night ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>Because I 'd told the gendarmes so and I did n't want to make myself out a liar .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>And why did you tell the gendarmes that ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>Because I thought they 'd arrest me on account of the smuggling .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Good . Then you did n't go to Irissary that night ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>No .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Where did you go ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>Up the mountain , to look for a horse that had got away the night before , one of a lot we were taking to Spain .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Good . Excellent . That is n't badly thought out — that can be maintained . You went to look for a horse lost on the mountain , a horse which escaped from a lot you were smuggling over the frontier on the previous night . Excellent . If that is true , there is nothing for it but to set you at liberty before we are much older . Now to prove that you 've simply to tell me to whom you sold the horse ; we shall send for the purchaser , and if he confirms your statement , I will sign your discharge . To whom did you sell the horse ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>I did n't sell it .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>You gave it away ? You did something with it !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>No — I did n't find it again .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>You did n't find it again ! The devil ! That 's not so good . Come ! Let 's think of something else . You did n't go up the mountain all alone ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>Yes , all alone .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Bad luck ! Another time , you see , you ought to take a companion . Were you out long ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>All night . I got in at five in the morning .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>A long time .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>We are n't well off , and a horse is worth a lot of money .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Yes . But you did n't spend the whole night on the mountain without meeting someone — shepherds or customs officers ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>It was raining in torrents .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Then you met no one ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>No one .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>I thought as much .<stage>In a tone of disappointed reproach , with apparent pity</stage>Tell me , Etchepare , do you take the jurymen for idiots ?<stage>Silence</stage>So that 's all you 've been able to think of ? I said you were intelligent just now . I take that back . But think what you 've told me — a rigmarole like that . Why , a child of eight would have done better . It 's ridiculous I tell you — ridiculous . The jurymen will simply shrug their shoulders when they hear it . A whole night out of doors , in the pouring rain , to look for a horse you do n't find — and without meeting a living soul — no shepherds , no customs officers — and you go home at five in the morning — although at this time of the year it 's daylight by then — yes , and before then — but no , no one saw you and you saw no one . So everybody was stricken with blindness , eh ? A miracle happened , and everyone was blind that night . You do n't ask me to believe that ? No ? Why not ? It 's quite as probable as what you do tell me . So everybody was n't blind ?<stage>The recorder bursts into a laugh ; the gendarmes imitate him</stage>You see what it 's worth , your scheme of defence ! You make the gaolers and my recorder laugh . Do n't you agree with me that your new method of defence is ridiculous ? ETCHEPARE<stage>abashed , under his breath</stage>I do n't know .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Well , if you do n't know , we do ! Come now ! I have no advice to give you . You repeat that at the trial and see what effect you produce . But why not confess ? Why not confess ? I really do n't understand your obstinacy . I repeat , I really do not understand it .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>Well , if I did n't do it , am I to say all the same that I did ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>So you persist in your story of the phantom horse ? You persist in it , do you ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>How do I know ? How should I know what I ought to say ? I should do better not to say anything at all — everything I say is turned against me !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Because the stories you invent are altogether too improbable — because you think me more of a fool than I am in thinking that I am going to credit such absurd inventions . I preferred your first method ; at least you had two witnesses to speak for you — two witnesses who were not worth very much , it 's true , but witnesses all the same . You 've made a change ; well , you are within your rights . Let us stick to the lost horse .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>Well , then ?<stage>A long pause</stage></p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Come ! Out with it ! ETCHEPARE<stage>without emphasis , hesitation , gazing at the recorder as though to read in his eyes whether he was replying as he should</stage>Well , I 'm going to tell you , Monsieur . You are right — it is n't true — I did n't go up into the mountain . What I said first of all was the truth — I did n't go out at all . Just now I was all muddled . At first I denied everything , even what was true — I was so afraid of you . Then , when you told me — I do n't remember what it was — my head 's all going like — I do n't know — I do n't remember — but all the same I know I am innocent . Well , just now , I almost wished I could admit I was guilty if only you 'd leave me in peace . What was I saying ? I do n't remember . Ah , yes — when you told me — whatever it was , I 've forgotten — it seemed to me I 'd better say I 'd gone out — and I told a lie . But<stage>sincerely</stage>what I swear to you is that I am not the guilty man . I swear it , I swear it !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>I repeat , I ask nothing better than to be able to believe it . So now it 's understood , is it , that you were at home ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>Yes , Monsieur .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>We shall hear your wife directly . You have no other witnesses to call ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>No , Monsieur .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Good . Take the accused away — but remain in the Court . I shall probably need him directly for a confrontation . His interrogatory is n't finished . The gendarmes lead Etchepare away .</p>

        <p>Yes , that brought tears to one 's eyes . It made one feel one wanted to confess even though one had n't done anything !</p>

        <p>Did n't it ? Ah , if I had n't got this headache !<stage>A pause</stage>I did a stupid thing just now .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>I did . I was wrong to show him how improbable that new story of his was . It is so grotesque that it would have betrayed him — while , if he goes on asserting that he never left the house , if the servant insists he did n't , and if the wife says the same thing , that 's something that may create a doubt in the mind of the jury . He saw that perfectly , the rascal ! He felt that of the two methods the first was the better . That 's one against me , my good Benoît .<stage>To himself</stage>That must be set right . Let me think . Etchepare is the murderer , there 's no doubt about that . I am as certain of that as if I 'd been present . So he was n't at home on the night of the crime and his wife knows it . After the way he hesitated just now — if I can get the wife to confess that he was absent from home till the morning , we get back to the ridiculous story of the lost horse , and I catch him twice in a flagrant lie , and I 've got him . Come , we must give the good woman a bit of a roasting and get the truth out of her . It 'll be devilish queer if I do n't succeed .<stage>To the recorder</stage>What did I do with the police record of the woman Etchepare that was sent from Paris ?</p>

       <stage>SCENE IX :— Mouzon , recorder , Yanetta .</stage>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Step forward . Now , Madame , I shall not administer the oath to you , since you are the wife of the accused . But none the less I beg you most urgently to tell the truth . I warn you that an untruth on your part might compel me to accuse you of complicity with your husband in the crime of which he is accused and force me to have you arrested at once .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>I 'm not afraid . I can n't be my husband 's accomplice because my husband is n't guilty .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>That is not my opinion . I will say further : you know a great deal more about this matter than you care to tell .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>I ? That 's infamous .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Come , come , no shouting ! I do n't say you took a direct part in the murder , I say it is highly probable that you knew of the murder , perhaps advised it , and that you have profited by it . That would be enough to place you in the dock beside your husband at the assizes . My treatment of you will depend on the sincerity of your answers to my questions . As you do or do not tell me the truth I shall either set you at liberty or have you arrested . Now you can n't say that I have n't warned you ! And now , if you please , inform me whether you persist in your first statement , in which you affirm that Etchepare stopped at home on the night of Ascension Day .</p>

        <p>Wait a moment . You have two children , whom you adore . You are an excellent mother . One hears of your almost heroic behavior at the time your eldest child was ill — Georges , I think .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>Yes , it was Georges . But what has that to do with the charge against my husband ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Have patience . You will see presently .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>Very well .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>It is all the more to your credit that you are what you are , for your husband does not give us an example of the same virtues . He occasionally gets drunk .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>No , he does n't .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Come — everyone knows that . He is violent .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>He 's not violent .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>So violent that he has been convicted four times for assault and battery .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>That 's possible ; at holiday times , in the evening , men get quarrelling . But that was a long time ago . Now he behaves better , and I 'm very happy with him .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>That surprises me .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>Anyhow , does that prove he murdered old Goyetche ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Your husband is very grasping .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>Poor people are forced to be very grasping or else to die of starvation .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>You defend him well .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>Did you suppose I was going to accuse him ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Have you ever been convicted ? YANETTA<stage>anxious</stage>Me ?</p>
       </sp>
       <stage>Mouzon . Yes , you . YANETTA [ weakly ] No , I 've never been convicted .</stage>
       <stage>Mouzon . That is curious because there was a girl of your name in Paris who was sentenced to a month 's imprisonment for receiving stolen property . YANETTA [ weakly ] For receiving stolen property —</stage>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>You are not quite so bold now — you are disturbed . YANETTA<stage>as before</stage>No —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>You are pale — you are trembling — you are feeling faint . Give her a chair , Benoît .<stage>The recorder obeys</stage>Pull yourself together !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>My God , you know that ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Here is the report which has been sent me . “ The woman Yanetta X — was brought to Paris at the age of sixteen as companion or lady 's maid by Monsieur and Madame So-and-so , having been employed by them in that capacity at Saint-Jean-de-Luz . ” Is that correct ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>Yes .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Here is some more . “ Illicit relations were before long formed between the girl Yanetta and the son of the family , who was twenty-three years of age . Two years later the lovers fled , taking with them eight thousand francs which the young man had stolen from his father . On the information of the latter the girl Yanetta was arrested and condemned to one month 's imprisonment for receiving stolen property . After serving her sentence she disappeared . It is believed that she returned to her own district . ” Are you the person mentioned here ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>Yes . My God , I thought that was all so long ago — so completely forgotten . It is all true , Monsieur , but for ten years now I 've given every minute of my life to making up for it , trying to redeem myself . Just now I answered you insolently ; I beg your pardon . You have not only my life in your hands now , but my husband 's , and the honor of my children .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Does your husband know of this ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>No , Monsieur . Oh , you are n't going to tell him ! I beg you on my knees ! It would be wicked , I tell you , wicked ! Listen , Monsieur — listen . I came back to the country ; I hid myself ; I would rather have died ; I did n't want to stay in Paris — you understand why — and then in a little while I lost mother . Etchepare was in love with me , and he bothered me to marry him . I refused — I had the courage to go on refusing for three years . Then — I was so lonely , so miserable , and he was so unhappy , that in the end I gave way . I ought to have told him everything . I wanted to , but I could n't . It would have hurt him too much . For he 's a good man , Monsieur , I swear he is .<stage>Mouzon makes a gesture</stage>Yes , I know , sometimes when he 's been drinking , he 's violent . I was going to tell you about that . I do n't want to tell you any more untruths . But it 's very seldom he 's violent now .<stage>Weeping</stage>Oh , do n't let him know , Monsieur , do n't let him know . He 'd go away — he 'd leave me — he 'd take my children from me .<stage>She gives a despairing cry</stage>Ah , he 'd take my children from me ! I do n't know what to say to you — but it is n't possible — you can n't tell him — now you know all the harm it would do . You wo n't ? Of course I was guilty — but I did n't understand — I did n't know . I was n't seventeen , sir , when I went to Paris . My master and mistress had a son ; he forced me almost — and I loved him — and then he wanted to take me away because his parents wanted to send him away by himself . I did what he asked me . That money — I did n't know he had stolen it — I swear I did n't know —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>That 's all right ; control yourself .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>Yes , Monsieur .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>We 'll put that on one side for the moment .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>Yes , Monsieur .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Now your husband —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>Yes , Monsieur . MOUZON<stage>with great sincerity</stage>You will have need of all your courage , my poor woman . Your husband is guilty .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>It 's impossible ! It 's impossible ! MOUZON<stage>with great sincerity</stage>He has not confessed it , but he is on the point of doing so . I myself know what happened that night after he left your house — witnesses have told me .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>No ! No ! My God , my God ! Witnesses ? What witnesses ? It is n't true !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Well , then , do n't be so obstinate ! In your own interest , do n't be so stubborn ! Shall I tell you what will be the end of it ? You will ruin your husband ! If you insist on contradicting the evidence , that he passed the night away from the house , you 'll ruin him , I tell you . On the other hand , if you will only tell me the truth , then if he is not the murderer , he will tell us what he did do and who his companions were .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>He had n't any .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Then he went out alone ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>Yes .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>At ten o'clock ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>At ten .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>He returned alone at five in the morning ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>Yes , all alone .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>But perhaps you are thinking of some other night . It was really the night of Ascension Day when he went out alone ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>Yes .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Benoît , have you got that written down ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>RECORDER</speaker>
        <p>Yes , your worship .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Madame , I know how painful this must be to you , but I beg you to listen to me with the greatest attention . Your husband was pressed for money , was he not ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>No .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Yes .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>I tell you no .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Here is the proof . Three months ago he borrowed eight hundred francs from a cattle-dealer of Mauleon .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>He never told me about it .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Moreover , he owed a considerable sum to Goyetche .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>I 've never heard of that either .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Here is an acknowledgment written by your husband . It is in his handwriting ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>Yes , but I did n't know —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>You did n't know of the existence of this debt ? That tends to confirm what I know already — your husband went to Irissary .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>No , sir ; he tells me everything he does .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>But you see very well that he does n't , since you did n't know of the existence of this debt . He went to Irissary . Do n't you believe me ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>Yes , Monsieur , but he did n't kill a man for money ; it 's a lie , a lie , a lie !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>It 's a lie ! Now how am I to know that ? Your husband begins by denying everything , blindly , and then he takes up two methods of defence in succession . You yourself begin by a piece of false evidence . All this , I tell you again , will do for the man .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>I do n't know about that , but what I do tell you again is that he did n't kill a man for money .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Then what did he kill him for ? Perhaps after all he is n't as guilty as I supposed just now . Perhaps he acted without premeditation . This is what might have happened . Etchepare , a little the worse for drink , goes to Goyetche in order to ask him once more to wait for the payment of this debt . There is a dispute between the two men ; old Goyetche was still a strong man ; there may have been provocation on his part , and there may have been a struggle , with the tragic result you know of . In that case your husband 's position is entirely different — he is no longer a criminal premeditating a crime ; and the sentence pronounced against him may be quite a light one . So you see , my good woman , how greatly it is in your interest to obtain a complete confession from him . If he persists in his denials , I am afraid the jury will be extremely severe upon him . There is no doubt that he killed Goyetche ; but under what conditions did he kill him ? Everything depends on that . By persistently trying to pass for a totally innocent man he risks being thought more guilty than he is . Do you understand ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>Yes , Monsieur .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Will you speak to him as I suggest ? Shall I send for him ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>Yes , Monsieur .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p><stage>to the recorder</stage>Bring in the accused . Tell the gendarmes I shall not need them . Etchepare enters .</p>
       </sp>
       <stage>SCENE X :— The same , Etchepare .</stage>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>Pierre ! To see you here — my Pierre — a prisoner — like a thief ! My poor husband — my poor husband ! Oh , prove you have n't done anything ! Tell his worship — tell him the truth . It 'll be best . I beg you tell him the truth .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>It 's all no good . I know , I can feel , I 'm done for . All that I can do or say would be no use . Every word I do say turns against me . The gentleman wants me to be guilty . I must be guilty , according to him . So you see ! What would you have me do , my poor darling ? I 've got no strength to go on struggling against him . Let them do what they like with me ; I sha n't say anything more .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>Yes , yes , you must speak . You must defend yourself . I beg of you , Pierre . I beg of you , defend yourself .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>What 's the use ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>I beg you to in the name of your children . They do n't know anything yet — but they cry because they see me crying — because , you see , I can n't hide it , I can n't control myself always in front of them . I can n't be cheerful , can I ? And then they love me , so they notice it . And they ask me questions , questions . If you only knew ! They ask me about you . André was asking me again this morning , “ Where 's father ? Are you going to look for him ? Tell me , are you going to fetch him ? ” I told him “ yes ” and I ran away . You see you must defend yourself so as to get back to them as soon as possible . If you 've anything to reproach yourself with , even the least thing , tell it . You are rough sometimes — so — I do n't know . But if you went to Irissary , you must say so . Perhaps you had a quarrel with the poor old man . If that was it , say so , say so . Perhaps you got fighting together and you — I 'm saying perhaps you did — I do n't know — you understand — but his worship promised me just now that if it was like that they would n't punish you — or not very much . My God , what am I to say to you ? What 's to be done ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>So you believe I 'm guilty — you too ! Tell me now ! Do you believe me guilty too ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>I do n't know ! I do n't know ! ETCHEPARE<stage>to Mouzon</stage>Ah , so you 've managed that too ; you 've thought of that too , to torture me through my wife — and it was you put it into her head to speak to me about my children . I do n't know what you can have told her , but you 've almost convinced her that I 'm a scoundrel , and you hoped she 'd succeed in sending me to the guillotine in the name of my children , because you know I worship them and they are everything to me . You are right ; I dare say there is n't another father living who loves his little ones more than I love mine .<stage>To Yanetta</stage>You know that , Yanetta ! You know that ! And you know too that with all my faults I 'm a true Christian , that I believe in God , in an almighty God . Well , then , listen ! My two boys — my little Georges , my little André — I pray God to kill them both if I 'm a criminal ! YANETTA<stage>with the greatest exultation</stage>He is innocent ! I tell you he 's innocent ! I tell you he 's innocent !<stage>A pause</stage>Ah , now you can bring your proofs , ten witnesses , a hundred if you like , and you might tell me you saw him do it — I should tell you : It 's not true ! It 's not true ! You might prove to me that he had confessed to it himself , and I would tell you it was n't true ! Oh , you must feel it , your worship . You have a heart — you know what it is when one loves one 's children — so you must be certain , you too , that he 's innocent . You are going to give him back to me , are n't you ? It 's settled now and you will give him back to me ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>If he is innocent , why did he lie just now ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>It was you who lied — you ! You told me you had witnesses who saw me leave my house that night — and you had n't anyone !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>If I had no one at that moment , I have someone now . Yes , there is a witness who has declared that you were not at home on the night of the crime , and that witness is your wife ! ETCHEPARE<stage>to Yanetta</stage>You ! MOUZON<stage>to the recorder</stage>Give me her interrogatory . While Mouzon looks through his papers Yanetta gazes for some time at her husband , then at Mouzon . She is reflecting deeply . Finally she seems to have made up her mind .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>There . Your wife has just told us that you left the house at ten o'clock and did not return until five in the morning . YANETTA<stage>very plainly</stage>I did not say that . It is not true .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>You went on to say that he returned alone .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>I did not say that .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>I will read your declaration .<stage>He reads</stage>Question : Then he went out alone ? Reply : Yes . Question : At ten o'clock ? Reply : At ten o'clock .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>I did not say that .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Come , come ! And I was careful to be precise . I said to you , “ But perhaps you are thinking of another night ? It was really on the night of Ascension Day that he went out alone ? ” And you replied , “ Yes . ”</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>It 's not so !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>But I have it written here !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>

        <p>Ah , you are angry , are n't you — furious — because you have n't got your way ! Although you 've done everything , everything you possibly could , short of killing us by inches ! You pretend to be kind . You spoke kindly to us . You wanted to make me send my husband to the scaffold !<stage>Mouzon has taken up his brief and affects to be studying it with indifference</stage>It 's your trade to supply heads to the guillotine . You must have criminals , guilty men , you must have them at any cost . When a man falls into your clutches he 's a dead man . They come in here innocent and they 've got to go out again guilty . It 's your trade ; it 's a matter of vanity with you to succeed ! You ask questions which do n't seem to mean anything in particular , and yet they may send a man to the next world ; and when you 've forced the poor wretch to condemn himself you 're delighted , like a savage would be ! MOUZON<stage>to the gendarmes</stage>Take her away — be quick !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>Yes , a savage ! You call that justice !<stage>To the gendarmes</stage>You do n't take me like that , I tell you !<stage>She clings to the furniture</stage>You 're a butcher ! You are as cruel as the people in history who broke one 's bones to make one confess !<stage>The gendarmes have dragged her free ; she lets herself fall to the ground and shouts the rest of her speech while the men drag her to the door at the back</stage>Brute ! Savage brute ! No , you do n't think so — you think yourself a fine fellow , I have n't a doubt , and you 're a butcher —</p>

        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>

        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>They tell me , Madame , that you wished to see one of the gentlemen of the Bar .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLD MADAME ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>Yes , sir .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>You wish to be present at the trial ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLD MADAME ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>No , sir . I know so well that they cannot condemn my son that what they say in there does n't interest me in the least . I am waiting for him . I have come because they have turned us out of our house .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>They have turned you out ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLD MADAME ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>The bailiffs came .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>Then your son owed money ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLD MADAME ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>Since they arrested him all our men have left us . We could n't get in the crops nor pay what was owing . But of course I know they 'll make all that good when my son is acquitted . LA BOUZOLE<stage>aside</stage>Poor woman !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLD MADAME ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>I 'm so thankful to see the end of all our troubles . He 'll come back and get our house and field again for us . He 'll make them give up our cattle . That 's why I wanted to see one of these gentlemen .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>Will you explain ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLD MADAME ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>A fortnight after the gendarmes came to arrest my boy , Monsieur Claudet turned the waste water from his factory into the brook that passes our house where we water the beasts . That was one of the things that ruined us too . If Etchepare finds things like that when he gets back , God knows what he 'll do ! I want the law to stop them doing us all this harm .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>The law ! Ah , my good woman , it would be far better for you to have nothing to do with the law .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLD MADAME ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>But why ? There is justice , and it 's for everybody alike .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>Of course .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLD MADAME ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>Has Monsieur Claudet the right —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>Certainly not .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLD MADAME ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>Then I want to ask the judge to stop him .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>It is not so simple as you suppose , Madame . First of all you must go to the bailiff .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLD MADAME ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>Good .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>He will make a declaration .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLD MADAME ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>What about ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>He will declare that your water supply is contaminated .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLD MADAME ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>There is no need to trouble a bailiff , sir . A child could see that .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>It is the law .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLD MADAME ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>Well , and then ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>Then you must go to a lawyer and get a judgment .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLD MADAME ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>Very well , if there ‘ s no other way of doing it —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>That is not all . If Monsieur Claudet contests the facts , the President will appoint an expert who will visit the site and make a report . You will have to put in a request that the President will grant a speedy hearing on grounds of urgency . Your case being finally put on the list of causes , it would be heard in its turn — after the vacations .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLD MADAME ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>After the vacations !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>And that is not all . Monsieur Claudet 's lawyer might default , in which case judgment would be declared in your favor . But Monsieur Claudet might defend the case , or enter some kind of plea and obtain a judgment on that plea , or appeal against the judgment before the matter would be finally settled . All this would cost a great deal of money .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLD MADAME ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>Who would pay it ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>You , naturally , and Monsieur Claudet .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLD MADAME ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>It 's all one to him ; he 's rich ; but for us , who have n't a penny left !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>Then you would have to apply for judicial assistance .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLD MADAME ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>That would take still more time ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>That would take much longer .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLD MADAME ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>But , sir , I 've always been told that justice was free in France .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>Justice is gratuitous , but the means of obtaining access to justice are not . That is all .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLD MADAME ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>And all that would take — how long ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>If Monsieur Claudet were to appeal , it might last two years .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLD MADAME ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>It is n't possible ! Is n't the right on my side ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>My poor woman , it 's not enough to have the right on your side — you must have the law on your side too .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLD MADAME ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>I understand . Justice is a thing we poor people can know only when it strikes us down . We can know it only by the harm it does us . Well — we must go away — it does n't matter where — and I sha n't regret it ; people insult us ; they call out to us as they pass . Etchepare would n't put up with that .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>In that respect the law protects you . Register a complaint and those who insult you will be prosecuted .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLD MADAME ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>I do n't think so . I have already registered a complaint , as you say , but they 've done nothing to the man who injured us . So he goes on .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>Is he an inhabitant of your commune ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLD MADAME ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>Yes . A neighbor , a friend of Monsieur Mondoubleau , the deputy . Labastide .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>Good . I will do what I can , I promise you .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLD MADAME ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>Thank you , sir .<stage>A pause</stage>Then I will go and wait till they give me back my boy .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>

        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>What has happened , Madame Bunerat ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>It 's that advocate ! What talent ! What a heart ! What feeling ! What genius ! I feel quite shaken — quite upset —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>It 's an acquittal ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>They hope so — MADAME VAGRET<stage>entering</stage>Well , my dear Monsieur La Bouzole , you have heard this famous advocate ! What a ranter !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>It seems he has touched the jury . That means an acquittal .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>I 'm very much afraid it does .</p>

        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>Do you know what they tell me ? The Attorney-General is here !</p>

       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>It is true enough . He brings Monsieur Mouzon his appointment to the Court of Appeal at Pau .</p>

        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>Mouzon !</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET AND MADAME BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>And my husband ! We had a definite promise ! The President of Assizes enters , wearing a red gown .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <lg>
         <l>Good-day , gentlemen . You have not seen the</l>
         <l>Attorney-General , have you ?</l>
        </lg>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>No , your honor — but if you will wait —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>No . Tell me , La Bouzole — you are an old stager — were you in Court ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>From the balloting for the jurymen to the plea for the defence .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>Did you notice if I let anything pass that would make an appeal to the Court of Cassation possible ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>I am sure you did n't .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>It 's my constant fear — I am thinking of nothing else all the time counsel are speaking . I always have the Manual of the President of Assizes wide open in front of me ; I 'm always afraid , nevertheless , of forgetting some formality . You see the effect of being in the Chancellery — I never have a quiet conscience until the time-limit has expired .<stage>A pause</stage>They tell me there were journalists here from Toulouse and Bordeaux .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>And one from Paris .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>One from Paris ! Are you sure ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>He was standing near the prisoner 's bench .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>He was left to stand ! A journalist from Paris and he was left to stand !<stage>Catching sight of the recorder</stage>You knew that , Monsieur the recorder , and you did n't warn me ? Is that how you perform your duties ? Go at once and express my regret and find him a good seat ; do you hear ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>RECORDER</speaker>
        <p>Yes , your honor .<stage>He turns to go</stage>THE PRESIDENT<stage>running after him</stage>Here !<stage>Aside to the recorder</stage>Find out if he 's annoyed .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>And then —<stage>He encounters Madame Bunerat at the door . Pardon , Madame . He goes out , running , lifting up his gown</stage></p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>LA BOUZOLE</speaker>
        <p>When I was at Montpellier I knew an old tenor who was as anxious as that at his third début — Enter Mouzon . Frigid salutations . MADAME BUNERAT<stage>after a pause</stage>Is it true , Monsieur Mouzon —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>That the Attorney-General —</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>Has arrived ? MOUZON<stage>haughtily</stage>Quite true .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>They say he brings a councillor 's appointment .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>They say so .</p>

       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>I am waiting for your explanation . MOUZON<stage>as before</stage>You have been young , your honor —</p>

        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>Not to that extent , Monsieur !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>I admit I overstepped the mark a trifle . ATTORNEY-GENERAL<stage>reading</stage>“ Being in a state of intoxication , together with the woman Pecquet and two other women of bad character who accompanied him , the aforesaid Mouzon used insulting and outrageous language to the police , whom he threatened with dismissal . ” Is that what you call overstepping the mark a trifle ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Perhaps the expression is a little weak .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>And you allow the name of a magistrate to be coupled in a police report with that of the woman Pecquet ?</p>

        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>She told me her name was Diane de Montmorency .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p><stage>continuing</stage>“ Questioned by us , the commissary of police , on the following morning , as to the rank of officer in the navy which he had assumed ” —<stage>The Attorney-General gazes at Mouzon . Another pause</stage>MOUZON<stage>still smiling</stage>Yes , it 's on account of my whiskers , you know .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>Really ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>When I — oh , well — when I go to Bordeaux I always assume the rank of naval officer , in order to safeguard the dignity of the law .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>You seem to have been a little tardy in considering it .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>I beg you to note , your honor , that I endeavored to safeguard it from the very first , since I took care to go out of the arrondissement and even the judicial division — in order to —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>I will continue . “ Monsieur Mouzon then informed us of his actual position as examining magistrate , and invoked that quality in requesting that we would stop proceedings . ”</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>The ass . He has put that in his report ? Oh , really — that 's due to his lack of education . No , it 's a political affair — the commissary is one of our opponents — I asked him — After all — I wanted to avoid scandal . Anyone would have done the same in my place .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>Is that the only explanation you have to give me ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Explanation ? The truth is , Monsieur , that if you insist on maintaining , in this conversation , the relations between a superior and a subordinate , I can give you no further explanation . But if you would be so good as to allow me for a moment to forget your position , if you would agree to talk to me as man to man , I should tell you that this was a fault of youth , regrettable , no doubt , but explained by the profound boredom which exudes from the very paving-stones of Mauleon . Come , come ! I had dined too well . Every night of the year a host of decent fellows find themselves in the same case . It 's a pecadillo which does n't affect one 's personal honor .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>Monsieur , when one has the honor to be a magistrate — when one has accepted the mission of judging one 's fellows , one is bound more than all others to observe temperance and to consider one 's dignity in all things . What may not affect the honor of the private citizen does affect the honor of the judge . You may take that for granted .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>As you refuse to discuss the matter otherwise than in an official manner , nothing remains for me but to beg you to inform me what you have decided to do .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>Cannot you guess ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>I am an examining magistrate . You will make me an ordinary magistrate . It means my income will be diminished by five hundred francs a year . I accept .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>It is unfortunately impossible for me to content myself with such a simple measure . To speak plainly , I must inform you that Monsieur Coire , the director of the newspaper which attacks us so persistently , is acquainted with the whole of the facts of the accusation brought against you and will not give his word not to publish them unless by the end of the month you have left the Mauleon Court . I therefore find myself in the unhappy necessity of demanding your resignation .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>I shall not resign .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>You will not resign ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>I am distressed to oppose any desire of yours , but I am quite decided . I shall not resign .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>But really — you cannot know —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>I know everything . ATTORNEY-GENERAL . Very well , sir , we shall proceed against you .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Proceed .<stage>He rises</stage></p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>Are you not alarmed at the scandal which would result from your appearance in court and your probable conviction ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Conviction is less probable than you think . I shall be able to defend myself and to select my advocate . As for the scandal , it would n't fall on me . I am a bachelor , with no family ; I know no one or next to no one in Mauleon , where I am really in exile . My friends are all in Bordeaux ; they belong to the monde ou l'on s'amuse , and I should not in the least lose caste in their eyes on account of such a prosecution . You think I ought to leave the magistracy ? Fortunately I have sufficient to live on without the thirty-five hundred francs the Government of the Republic allows me annually .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>That is enough , Monsieur . Good-day .</p>

        <p>Is there a movement in preparation ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>There is . As for Monsieur Ardeuil , the Minister confined himself to saying that he had confidence in your firmness and zeal .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>The Keeper of the Seals may rely on me . I shall have to show considerable severity in several directions here , and I shall lack neither determination nor zeal , I can assure you .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>Yes , but above all , tact ! Eugène repeated a dozen times , “ Above all , no prosecutions , no scandals . At the present moment less than ever . We are being watched . So everything must be done quietly . ”</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>You need n't be alarmed . There 's the matter of Mouzon .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>Mouzon ! Mouzon the examining magistrate !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>Yes .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>Of Mauleon ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>Precisely .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>You are n't thinking of — One of my best friends — very well disposed — a capital fellow — an excellent magistrate , full of energy and discernment . I mentioned his name to Eugène in connection with the vacant post of Councillor .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p><stage>offering him the report</stage>You 've picked the wrong man . I am going to show you a document about him . Besides , the post is promised to Monsieur Vagret .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>What is wrong ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <lg>
         <l>Here . I shall have to report him to the Superior</l>
         <l>Council of the Magistracy or proceed against him in the Court of Appeal .</l>
        </lg>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>What has he done ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>Read it . MONDOUBLEAU<stage>after casting a glance over the document which the other has handed to him</stage>Of course . But really — there 's nothing in that . If you keep quiet about it , no one will know anything . No scandal . The magistracy is suffering from too many attacks already just now , without our providing our enemies with weapons .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>Unfortunately Coire knows of it , and he threatens to tell the whole story in his paper unless Monsieur Mouzon is sent away from Mauleon .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>The devil !<stage>He begins to laugh</stage></p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>What are you laughing at ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>Nothing — an extravagant idea , a jest .<stage>He laughs</stage>Tell me — but you wo n't be annoyed ?— it 's only a joke —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>Well ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>I was thinking — I tell you , it 's a grotesque idea . But after all — after all , if you propose Mouzon for the Councillor 's chair at Pau , you will be pleasing everyone !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>My dear deputy —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>A joke — of course , merely a joke — but what 's so amusing about it is that if you did so it would please Coire , it would please me , it would please Mouzon , and it would please Eugène , who does n't want any scandal .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>But it would be a —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>No , no . In politics there can be no scandal except where there is publicity .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>But really —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>I agree with you — I know all that could be said — I repeat , I am only chaffing . And do you realize — it 's very curious — when one reflects — this fantastic solution is the only one that does not offer serious disadvantages — obvious disadvantages . That is so . If you leave Mouzon here , Coire tells everything . If you proceed against him , you give a certain section of the press an opportunity it wo n't lose — an opportunity of sapping one of the pillars of society . Those gentry are not particular as to the means they employ . They will confound the whole magistracy with Mouzon . It wo n't be Mouzon who will be the rake , but the Court , the Court of Appeal . There will be mud on all — on every robe .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>But you can n't seriously ask me —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>Do you know what we ought to do ? Let us go and talk it over with Rollet the senator — he is only a step from here .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>I assure you —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>Come — come . You will put in a word as to your going to Orléans at the same time . What have you to risk ? I tell you my solution is the best . You will come to it , I assure you ! I 'll take you along .<stage>He takes his arm</stage></p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <lg>
         <l>Well , well , I had certainly something to say to</l>
         <l>Rollet .</l>
         <l>The doorkeeper enters .</l>

        <p>Where are they ? The verdict —?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>DOORKEEPER</speaker>
        <p>Not yet . Monsieur Vagret has been making a reply .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>Is the jury in the withdrawing room ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>DOORKEEPER</speaker>
        <p>No , your honor . They were going out when Monsieur Vagret asked for an adjournment .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MONDOUBLEAU</speaker>
        <p>What an idea ! Really ! Well , my friend , let us go . I tell you , you 'll come round ! ATTORNEY-GENERAL<stage>weakly</stage>Never ! Never !</p>
       </sp>
       <stage>SCENE VII :— Recorder , then the doorkeeper , then Madame Vagret , the President of Assizes , Bunerat , Madame Bunerat , and Vagret . RECORDER [ much moved ] Admirable ! DOORKEEPER [ half opening the door at the back ] Monsieur Benoît ! What 's the news ?</stage>
       <sp>
        <speaker>RECORDER</speaker>
        <p>Splendid ! Our Prosecutor was admirable — and that Etchepare is the lowest swine .</p>
       </sp>
       <stage>Enter Madame Vagret , greatly moved . The recorder goes up to her . The doorkeeper disappears .</stage>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Ah ! My God !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>RECORDER</speaker>
        <p>Madame Vagret , I am only a simple clerk , but allow me to say it was admirable ! Wonderful !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Wonderful !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>RECORDER</speaker>
        <p>As for the counsel from Bordeaux , Monsieur Vagret had him absolutely at his mercy !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Had n't he ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>RECORDER</speaker>
        <p>He 's certain enough , now , to be condemned to death !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Certain !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>RECORDER</speaker>
        <p>Madame , the jurymen were looking at that fellow Etchepare , that thug , in a way that made my blood run cold . As Monsieur Vagret went on with his speech you felt they would have liked to settle his hash themselves — the wretch !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>I saw that —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>RECORDER</speaker>
        <p>I beg your pardon , Madame — I am forgetting myself — but there are moments when one is thankful , yes , so gratified , that social differences do n't count .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>You are right , my dear man .</p>
       </sp>
       <stage>Enter the President of Assizes and Bunerat .</stage>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>Madame , I congratulate you ! We 've got it , the capital sentence !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>We have it safely this time , have n't we , Monsieur ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>That is certain . But where is our hero ? Magnificent — he was magnificent — was n't he , Bunerat ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>Oh , sir , but the manner in which you presided prepared the way so well —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>Well , well , I do n't say I count for nothing in the result , but we must do justice to Vagret .<stage>To Madame Vagret</stage>You ought to be greatly gratified — very proud and happy , my dear Madame —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Oh , I am , your honor —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>But what a strange idea to demand an adjournment ! Is he unwell ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Oh , dear !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>No . Here he is .</p>
       </sp>
       <stage>Enter Vagret . He is anxious .</stage>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Ah , my dear !<stage>She takes his hand in hers . She can say no more , being choked by tears of joy</stage></p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>It was wonderful !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>I can n't restrain myself from congratulating you too .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Really , you confuse me . The whole merit is yours , Monsieur .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>Not at all . Do you know what carried them all away ?<stage>He lights a cigarette</stage></p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>No !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>It was when you exclaimed , “ Gentlemen of the jury , you own houses , farms , and property ; you have beloved wives , and daughters whom you tenderly cherish . Beware — ” You were splendid there !<stage>Resuming</stage>“ Beware , if you leave such crimes unpunished ; beware , if you allow yourselves to be led astray by the eloquent sentimentality of the defence ; beware , I tell you , if you fail in your duty as the instrument of justice ; beware , lest those above you snatch up the sword which has fallen from your feeble hands , when the blood that you have not avenged will be spilt upon you and yours ! ” That was fine ! Very fine ! And it produced a great effect .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>But you , my dear President , you moved them even more noticeably when you recalled the fact , very appropriately , that the accused loved the sight of blood .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>Ah , yes , that told a little !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ALL</speaker>
        <p>What ? What was that ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>The President put this question : “ On the morning of the crime did you not slaughter two sheep ? ” “ Yes , ” replied the accused . And then , looking him straight in the eyes —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>Yes , I asked him : “ You were getting into practice , were n't you ? ”<stage>To Vagret</stage>But after all , if I have to a certain extent affected the result , the greater part of the honor of the day is yours .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>You are too kind .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>Not at all ! And your peroration !<stage>With an artist 's curiosity</stage>You were really , were you not , under the stress of a great emotion , a really great emotion ? VAGRET<stage>gravely</stage>Yes , I was under the stress of a great emotion , a really great emotion .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>You turned quite pale when you faced the jury — when you added , in a clear voice , “ Gentlemen , I demand the head of this man ! ” VAGRET<stage>his eyes fixed</stage>Yes .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>Then you made a sign to the advocate .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Yes . I thought he would have something else to say .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>But why delay the verdict ? You had won the victory .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Precisely .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>What do you mean ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>During my indictment a fact came to light that worried me .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>A fact ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Not a fact — but — in short —<stage>A pause</stage>I beg your pardon — I am very tired —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>I can very well understand your emotion , my dear Vagret . One always feels — on the occasion of one 's first death sentence — but — you will see one gets used to it .<stage>Going out , to Bunerat</stage>Indeed , he does look very tired .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>I fancy he is feeling his position too keenly .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>As I was leaving the Court I met the Attorney-General . I begged him urgently to give me a moment 's conversation . I wanted to speak with him alone — and with you , Monsieur le Président .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>As you wish .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>I am afraid you are unwell , my dear . I shall wait there . I will come back directly these gentlemen have gone .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Very well . MADAME BUNERAT<stage>going out , to her husband</stage>There 's a man ready to do something stupid .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>BUNERAT</speaker>
        <p>That does n't concern us . They go out .</p>

        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>

        <p>The jury will decide . We can do no more , all of us , than bow to its verdict .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Let me tell you , sir , how my convictions have been shaken .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>I do not wish to know . All that is a matter between yourself and your conscience . You have the right to explain your scruples to the jury . You know the proverb : “ The pen is a slave , but speech is free . ”</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>I shall follow your advice .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>I do not give you any advice .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>I shall explain my doubts to the jury .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>It will mean acquittal .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>What would you have ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>Do as you wish ; but I should like to tell you one thing . When a man plans a startling trick of this kind and has the courage to accomplish it entirely of his own accord , he must have the courage to accept the sole responsibility of the blunders he may commit . You are too clever ; you want to discover some means by which you need not be the only one to suffer from the consequences of your vacillations .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Clever ? I ? How ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>Come , come ! We are not children , and I can perfectly well see the trap into which you have lured me . You are sheltering yourself behind me . If the Chancellery should complain of your attitude , you will say that you consulted your superior , and I shall be the victim . And then I shall have a quarrel with the Chancellery on my hands . You do n't care , you do n't think of my position or my interests , of which you know nothing . Some silly idea gets into your head , and against my will you want to make me responsible for it . I say again , it is extremely clever , and I congratulate you , but I do n't thank you .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>You have misunderstood me , sir . I have no wish to burden you with the responsibilities I am about to assume . I should hardly choose the moment when I am on the point of being appointed Councillor to perpetrate such a blunder . I told you of my perplexity , and I asked your advice . That was all .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>Are you certain one way or the other ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>If I were certain , should I ask advice ?<stage>A pause</stage>If we only had a cause for cassation , a good — THE PRESIDENT<stage>enraged</stage>What 's that you say ? Cause for cassation ? Based on an error or on an oversight on my part , no doubt ! Really , you have plenty of imagination ! You are attacked by certain doubts , certain scruples — I do n't know what — and in order to quiet your morbidly distracted conscience you ask me kindly to make myself the culprit ! Convenient , in truth , to foist on others who have done their duty the blunders one may have committed oneself ! ATTORNEY-GENERAL<stage>quietly</stage>It is indeed .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>And at the Chancellery , when they mention me , they 'll say , “ Whatever sort of a councillor is this , who has n't even the capacity to preside over an Assize Court at Mauleon ! ” A man whom we 've taken such trouble to get condemned ! And to make me , me , the victim of such trickery ! No , no ! Think of another way , my dear Monsieur ; you wo n't employ that , I can assure you .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Then I shall seek other means ; but I shall not leave matters in their present state .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>ATTORNEY-GENERAL</speaker>
        <p>Do what you like , but realize that I have given you no advice in one direction or another .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>I realize that .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>When you have decided to resume the hearing you will notify us .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>I will notify you . ATTORNEY-GENERAL<stage>to the President</stage>Let us go . They leave the office .</p>

       <stage>SCENE IX :— Vagret , Madame Vagret .</stage>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>What is it ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Nothing .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Nothing ? You are so depressed — and yet you 've just had such a success as will tell on your career .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>It is that success which alarms me .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Alarms you ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Yes , I 'm afraid —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Afraid of what ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Of having gone too far .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Too far ! Does n't the murderer deserve death ten times over ? VAGRET<stage>after a pause</stage>Are you quite certain , yourself , that he is a murderer ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Yes . VAGRET<stage>in a low voice</stage>Well — for myself —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>You ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>I — I do n't know . I know nothing .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>My God !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>A dreadful thing happened to me in the course of my indictment . While I , the State Attorney , the official prosecutor , was exercising my function , another self was examining the case calmly , in cold blood ; an inner voice kept reproaching me for my violence and insinuating into my mind a doubt , which has gone on increasing . A painful struggle has been going on in my mind , a cruel struggle — and if , as I was finishing , I labored under that emotion of which the President was speaking , if when I demanded the death penalty my voice was scarcely audible , it was because I was at the end of my struggle ; because my conscience was on the point of winning the battle , and I made haste to finish , because I was afraid it would speak out against my will . When I saw the advocate remain seated and that he was not going to resume his speech in order to tell the jury the things I would have had him tell them — then I was really afraid of myself , afraid of my actions , of my words , of their terrible consequences , and I wanted to gain time .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>But , my dear , you have done your duty ; if the advocate has not done his , that does not concern you .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Always the same reply . If I were an honest man I should tell the jury , when the hearing is resumed , of the doubts that have seized me . I should explain how those doubts arose in me ; I should call their attention to a point which I deliberately concealed from them , because I believed the counsel for the defence would point it out to him .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>You know , my dear , how thoroughly I respect your scruples , but allow me to tell you all the same that it wo n't be you who will declare Etchepare guilty or not guilty ; it will be the jury . If anyone ought to feel disturbed , it is Maître Plaçat , not you —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>But I ought to represent justice !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Here is a prisoner who comes before you with previous convictions , with a whole crushing series of circumstances establishing his guilt . He is defended by whom ? By one of the ornaments of the Bar , a man famed for his conscience as much as for his ability and his oratorical skill . You expound the facts to the jury . If the jury agrees with you , I cannot see that your responsibility as a magistrate is involved .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>I do n't think about my responsibility as a magistrate — but my responsibility as a man is certainly involved ! No ! No ! I have not the right . I tell you there is a series of circumstances in this case of which no one has spoken and the nature of which makes me believe in the innocence of the accused .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>But — these circumstances — how was it you knew nothing of them until now ? VAGRET<stage>his head drooping</stage>Do you think I did know nothing of them ? My God ! Shall I have the courage to tell you everything ? I am not a bad man , am I ? I would n't wish anyone to suffer for a fault of mine — but — oh , I am ashamed to admit it , to say it aloud , even , when I have admitted it to myself ! Well , when I was studying the brief , I had got it so firmly fixed in my mind , to begin with , that Etchepare was a criminal , that when an argument in his favor presented itself to my mind , I rejected it utterly , shrugging my shoulders . As for the facts of which I am speaking , and which gave rise to my doubts — at first I simply tried to prove that those facts were false , taking , from the depositions of the witnesses , only that which would militate against their truth and rejecting all the rest , with a terrible simplicity of bad faith . And in the end , in order to dissipate my last scruples , I told myself , just as you told me , “ That is the business of the defence ; it is n't mine ! ” Listen , and you 'll see to what point the exercise of the magistrate 's office distorts our natures , makes us unjust and cruel . At first I had a feeling of delight when I saw that the President , in his cross-examination , was throwing no light whatever on this series of little facts . It was my profession speaking in me , my profession , do you see ? Oh , what poor creatures we are , what poor creatures !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Perhaps the jury wo n't find him guilty ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>It will find him guilty .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Or it may find there are extenuating circumstances .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>No . I adjured them too earnestly to refuse to do so . I was zealous enough , was n't I ? Violent enough ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>That 's true . Why did you make your indictment so passionately ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Ah , why , why ? Long before the hearing of the case it was so clearly understood by everybody that the prisoner was the criminal ! And then it all went to my head , it intoxicated me — the way they talked . I was the spokesman of humanity , I was to reassure the countryside , I was to restore tranquillity to the family , and I do n't know what else ! So then — I felt I must show myself equal to the part intrusted to me . My first indictment was relatively moderate — but when I saw the celebrated counsel making the jurymen weep , I thought I was lost ; I felt the verdict would escape me . Contrary to my habit , I replied . When I rose to my feet for the second time I was like a man fighting , who has just had a vision of defeat , and who therefore fights with the strength of despair . From that moment Etchepare , so to speak , no longer existed . I was no longer concerned to defend society or sustain my accusation ; I was contending against the advocate ; it was a trial of orators , a competition of actors ; I had to be the victor at all costs . I had to convince the jury , resume my hold on it , wring from it the double “ yes ” of the verdict . I tell you , Etchepare no longer counted ; it was I who counted , my vanity , my reputation , my honor , my future . It 's shameful , I tell you , shameful . At any cost I wanted to prevent the acquittal which I felt was certain . And I was so afraid of not succeeding that I employed every argument , good and bad , even that of representing to the terrified jurymen their own houses in flames , their own flesh and blood murdered . I spoke of the vengeance of God falling on judges without severity . And all this in good faith — or rather unconsciously , in a burst of passion , in an access of anger against the advocate , whom I hated at that moment with all my might . My success was greater than I hoped ; the jury is ready to obey me ; and I , my dear , I have allowed myself to be congratulated , I have grasped the hands held out to me . That is what it is to be a magistrate !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MADAME VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Never mind . Perhaps there are n't ten in all France who would have acted otherwise .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>You are right . Only — if one reflects — it 's precisely that that 's so dreadful . RECORDER<stage>entering</stage>Monsieur le Procureur , the President is asking when the sitting can be resumed .</p>
       </sp>

       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Ah , I assure you that I am moderate ! If I were to speak what is in my mind , you would hear very unpleasant things . THE PRESIDENT<stage>in shirt sleeves</stage>Are you forgetting to whom you are speaking ? I am a Councillor of the Court , Monsieur le Procureur .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Once again , I am not speaking to you merely ; the disagreeable things I might say would condemn me equally . I am thinking of those poor people .

       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>They are acquitted , true ; but they are condemned , all the same . They are sentenced to misery for life .</p>

       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>And through your fault , Monsieur . THE PRESIDENT<stage>stopping in his task of folding his gown</stage>My fault !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>And what is so particularly serious is that you did n't know it , you did n't see , you have n't seen the harm you did .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>What harm ? I have done no harm ! I ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>When you informed Etchepare that his wife had long ago been condemned for receiving stolen goods , and that she had been seduced before his marriage with her . When you did that you did a wicked thing .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>You are a Don Quixote . Do you suppose Etchepare did n't know all that ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>If you had noticed his emotion when his wife , on your asking her if the facts were correct , replied that they were , you would be certain , as I am , that he knew nothing . THE PRESIDENT<stage>packing his gown in its box</stage>Well , even so ! You attribute to people of that sort susceptibilities which they do n't possess .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Your honor , “ people of that sort ” have hearts , just as you and I have .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>Admitted . Did n't my duty force me to do as I did ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>I know nothing about that . THE PRESIDENT<stage>still in shirt sleeves</stage>It 's the law that is guilty , then , eh ? Yes ? Well , Monsieur , if I did my duty — and I did — you are lacking in your duty in attacking the law , whose faithful servant you should be , the law which I , for one , am proud to represent .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>There 's no reason for your pride .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>Monsieur !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>It 's a monstrous thing , I tell you , that one can reproach an accused person , whether innocent or guilty , with a fault committed ten years ago , and which has been expiated . Yes , Monsieur , it is a horrible thing that , after punishing , the law does not pardon . THE PRESIDENT<stage>who has put on his jacket and hat</stage>If you think the law is bad , get it altered . Enter Parliament .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Alas , if I were a deputy , it is probable that I should be like the rest ; instead of thinking of such matters I should think of nothing but calculating the probable duration of the Government . THE PRESIDENT<stage>his box under his arm</stage>In that case — is the doorkeeper — VAGRET<stage>touching a bell</stage>He will come . Then it 's Monsieur Mouzon who is appointed in my place ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>It is Monsieur Mouzon .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Because he 's the creature of a deputy , a Mondoubleau —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <lg>
         <l>I cannot allow you to speak ill of Monsieur</l>
         <l>Mondoubleau — before my face .</l>
        </lg>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>You think you may perhaps have need of him .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE PRESIDENT</speaker>
        <p>Precisely .<stage>The doorkeeper appears</stage>Will you carry that to my hotel for me ? The hotel by the station . You will easily recognize it ; my sentry is at the door .<stage>He hands the doorkeeper his boxes</stage>Au revoir , my dear Vagret — no offence taken .</p>
       </sp>
       <stage>He goes . Vagret puts on his hat and also makes ready to go . Enter recorder and Etchepare .</stage>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE RECORDER</speaker>
        <p>You are going , your honor ?</p>

        <p>Yes .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>THE RECORDER</speaker>
        <p>You wo n't have any objection , then , if I bring Etchepare in here ? He 's in the corridor , waiting for the formalities of his release — and he complains he 's an object of curiosity to everyone .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Of course !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE RECORDER</speaker>
        <p>I 'll tell them to bring his wife here too when she leaves the record office .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>THE RECORDER</speaker>
        <p>She 's detained in connection with another case . She 's charged with abusing a magistrate in the exercise of his duty .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>VAGRET</speaker>
        <p>Is that magistrate Monsieur Mouzon ?</p>

        <p>Yes , Monsieur .</p>

        <p>I will try to arrange that .</p>

        <p>Yes , they 've just been telling me .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>For ten years I 've lived with that thief — that wretched woman ! How she lied ! Ah ! When I heard that judge say to her , “ You were convicted of theft and complicity with your lover , ” and when , before all those people , she owned to it — I tell you , mummy , I thought the skies were falling on my head — and when she admitted she 'd been that man 's mistress — I do n't know just what happened — nor which I would have killed soonest — the judge who said such things so calmly or her who admitted them with her back turned to me . And then I was on the point of confessing myself guilty — I , an innocent man — in order not to learn any more — to get away — but I thought of you and the children !<stage>A long pause</stage>Come ! We 've got to make up our minds what we 're going to do . You left them at home ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>THE MOTHER</speaker>
        <p>No . I had to send them to our cousin at Bayonne . We 've no longer got a home — we 've nothing — we are ruined . Besides , I 've got a horror of this place now . The women edge away and make signs to one another when I meet them , and in the church they leave me all alone in the middle of an empty space . Already — I had to take the children away from school .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>THE MOTHER</speaker>
        <p>No one would speak to them . One day Georges picked a quarrel with the biggest , and they fought , and as Georges got the better of it , the other , to revenge himself , called him the son of a gallows-bird .</p>

        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>
        <p>That 's what we 'll do . Go away . We 'll go and fetch them . To-morrow or to-night I shall be with you again . There are emigration companies there — boats to America — they 'll send all four of us — they 'll give us credit for the voyage on account of the children .</p>

        <p>If you are suffering you 've deserved it ! You have n't suffered enough yet . But what had I ever done to you that you should choose me for your victim ? What did I ever do that I should have to bear what I 'm suffering ? You 've made me a coward — you 've lowered me almost to your own level — I ought to have been able to put you out of my mind and my heart already ! And I can n't ! And I 'm suffering torture , terrible torture — for I 'm suffering through the love I once had for you . You — you were everything to me for ten years — my whole life . You 've been everything , everything ! And now the one hope left me is that I may forget you !</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>ETCHEPARE</speaker>

YANETTA<stage>changing her tone</stage>Ah , no , not that , not that ! The children ! No , you are wrong there ! You can deprive me of everything — you can put every imaginable shame upon me — you can force me to beg my bread — I 'll do it willingly . You need n't look at me — you need n't speak to me except to abuse me — you can do anything , anything you like . But my children , my children — they are mine , the fruit of my body — they are still part of me — they are blood of my blood and bone of my bone forever . You might cut off one of my arms , and my arm would be a dead thing , and no part of myself any more , but you can n't stop my children being my children .</p>

        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>Unworthy ! What has unworthiness to do with it ? Have I ever failed in my duty to them ? Have I been a bad mother ? Answer me ! I have n't , have I ? Well then , if I have n't been a bad mother , my rights over them are as great as ever they were ! Unworthy ! I might be a thousand times more guilty — more unworthy , as you call it — but neither you , nor the law , nor the priests , nor God himself would have the right to take them from me . I have been to blame as a wife , it 's possible , but as a mother I 've nothing to reproach myself with . Well then — well then — no one can steal them from me ! And you , who could think of such a thing , you 're a wretch ! Yes , it 's to avenge yourself that you want to part me from them ! You 're just a coward ! Just a man ! There 's no fatherhood left in your heart — you do n't think of them . Yes — you are lying — I tell you , you are lying ! When you say I 'm not worthy to bring them up you 're lying ! It 's only a saying — only words . You know it is n't true — you know I 've nourished them , cared for them , loved them , consoled them , and I have taught them to say their prayers every night , and I would go on doing so . You know that no other woman will ever fill my place — but that makes no difference to you . You forget them — you want to punish me , so you want to take them from me . I 'm justified in saying to you that it 's an act of cowardly wickedness and a vile piece of vengeance ! Ah ! The children ! You want to gamble with them now . No — to take them away from me — think , Pierre , think ; it is n't possible , what you are saying !</p>

        <p>You are right ; I am revenging myself ! What you think an impossibility is done already . My mother has taken the children and gone away with them .</p>

        <p>Ah , she 's there . Monsieur Vagret has been speaking of her . Well , I withdraw my complaint ; I ask nothing better than that she shall be set at liberty . Now that I am a Councillor I do n't want to be coming back from Pau every week for the examination . Proceed with the necessary formalities .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Well — in consideration of the time you have been in custody , I am willing that you should be set at liberty — provisional liberty . I may , perhaps , even withdraw my complaint if you express regret for having insulted me . YANETTA<stage>calmly</stage>I do not regret having insulted you .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Do you want to go back to prison ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>My poor man , if you only knew how little it matters to me whether I go to prison or not !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Why ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>Because I have nothing left , neither house , nor home , nor husband , nor children .<stage>She looks at him</stage>And — I think — I think —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>You think ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>I think it is you who are the cause of all the trouble .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>You are both acquitted , are n't you ? What more do you ask ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>We have been acquitted , it is true . But all the same , I am no longer an honest woman — neither to my husband , nor to my children , nor to the world .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>If anyone reproaches you with the penalty inflicted upon you formerly , if anyone makes any illusion to the time you have spent in custody under remand , you have the right to prosecute the offender in the courts . He will be punished .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>Well ! It is because someone reproached me with that old conviction that my husband has taken my children from me . That someone is a magistrate . Can I have him punished ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>No .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>Why not ? Because he is a magistrate ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>No . Because he is the law .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>The law !<stage>Violently</stage>Then the law is wicked , wicked !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>Come , no shouting , no insults , please .<stage>To the recorder</stage>Have you finished ? Then go to the office and have an order made out for her discharge .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>I 'm no scholar ; I 've not studied the law in books , like you , and perhaps for that very reason I know better than you what is just and what is not . And I want to ask you a plain question : How is the law going to give me back my children and make up to me for the harm it 's done me ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>The law owes you nothing .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>The law owes me nothing ! Then what are you going to do — you , the judge ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>A magistrate is not responsible .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>Ah , you are not responsible ! So you can arrest people just as you like , just when you fancy , on a suspicion or even without a suspicion ; you can bring shame and dishonor on their families ; you can torture the unhappy , ferret into their past lives , expose their misfortunes , dig up forgotten offences , offences which have been atoned for and which go back to ten years ago ; you can make use of your skill , your tricks and lies , and your cruelty to send a man to the foot of the scaffold , and worse still , you can drive people into taking a mother 's children away from her — and after that you say , like Pontius Pilate , that you are n't responsible ! Not responsible ! Perhaps you are n't responsible in the eyes of this law of yours , since you tell me you are n't , but in the eyes of pure and simple justice , the justice of decent people , the justice of God , before that I swear you are responsible , and that is why I am going to call you to account ! She sees on Mouzon 's desk the dagger which he uses as a paper-knife . He turns his back on her . She seizes the knife and puts it down again .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>I order you to get out of here .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>Listen to me . For the last time I ask you — what do you think you can do to make up to me — to give me back all I 've lost through your fault ; what are you going to do to lessen my misery , and how do you propose to give me back my children ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MOUZON</speaker>
        <p>I have nothing to say to you . I owe you nothing .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>YANETTA</speaker>
        <p>You owe me nothing ! You owe me more than life — more than everything . My children I shall never see again . What you 've taken from me is the happiness of every moment of the day — their kisses at night — the pride I felt in watching them grow up . Never , never again shall I hear them call me “ mother . ” It 's as though they were dead — it 's as though you had killed them .<stage>She seizes the knife</stage>Yes ! That 's your work ; it 's you bad judges have done it ; you have nearly made a criminal of an innocent man , and you force an honest woman , a mother — to become a criminal ! She stabs him . He falls .</p>
