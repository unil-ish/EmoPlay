     <stage type="setting">
      <stage>Front room on ground floor at 126 Redcliffe Gardens . An apartment furnished richly but in an old-fashioned way . Fine pictures . Large furniture . Sofa near centre . General air of neglect and dustiness . Carpet half-laid . Trunks and bags lying about in corners , some opened . Men 's wearing apparel exposed . Mantelpiece , R ., in disorder . At back double doors ( ajar ) leading to another room . Door , L ., leading to hall and front door .</stage>
     </stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TIME</speaker>
      <p>— Evening in August . ALBERT SHAWN is reclining on the sofa , fully dressed , but obviously ill : an overcoat has been drawn over his legs . A conspicuous object is a magnificent light purple dressing-gown thrown across a chair . Door bangs off . Enter ILAM CARVE in his shirt sleeves , hurriedly . SHAWN feebly tries to get up .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Now , do n't move . Remember you 're a sick man , and forget you 're a servant .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>SHAWN shivers . CARVE , about to put on his dressing-gown , changes his mind , and wraps it round SHAWN as well as he can . CARVE then puts on an oldish coat .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHAWN</speaker>
      <p><stage>Feebly .</stage>You 've been very quick , sir .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I found a red lamp only three doors off . He 'll be along in half a minute .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHAWN</speaker>
      <p>Did you explain what it was , sir ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Genially .</stage>How could I explain what it was , you fool , when I do n't know ? I simply asked to see the doctor , and I told him there was a fellow-creature suffering at No . 126 , and would he come at once . “ 126 ? ” he said , “ 126 has been shut up for years . ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHAWN</speaker>
      <p><stage>Trying to smile .</stage>What did you say , sir ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I said<stage>articulating with clearness</stage>a hundred and twenty-six — and ran off . Then he yelled out after me that he 'd come instantly .... I say , Shawn , we 're discovered . I could tell that from his sudden change of tone . I bet the entire street knows that the celebrated Me has arrived at last . I feel like a criminal already , dashed if I do n't ! I wish we 'd gone to a hotel now .<stage>Walks about .</stage>I say , did you make up the bed ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHAWN</speaker>
      <p>I was just doing it , sir .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>But what about sheets and so on ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHAWN</speaker>
      <p>I bought some this morning , ready hemmed , sir — with those and the travelling rug ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Well , do n't you think you could work your passage out to the bed ? With my help ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHAWN</speaker>
      <p>Me in your bed , sir !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Genially bullying .</stage>Keep on in that tone — and I 'll give you the sack on the spot . Now then . Try — before the doctor comes .<stage>Bell rings .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHAWN</speaker>
      <p>The bell , sir — excuse me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Confound ——</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Exit CARVE .</stage>
     <stage>SHAWN coughs and puts a handkerchief to his mouth . CARVE returns immediately with DR. PASCOE .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Glancing round quickly .</stage>This the patient ?<stage>Goes to SHAWN , and looks at him . Then , taking a clinical thermometer from his pocket and wiping it ; with marked respect .</stage>Allow me to put this under your tongue for half a minute .<stage>Having done so , he takes SHAWN 'S wrist and , looking at his watch , counts the patient 's pulse . Then turning to CARVE , in a low curt voiced</stage>When did this begin ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Just now . That is , he only began to complain about six o'clock . We arrived in London this morning from Madrid .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Reading thermometer .</stage>Temperature 104-1 / 2 . Pulse is 140 — and weak . I must have some boiling water .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>At a loss .</stage>What for ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>What for ? For a poultice .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Helplessly .</stage>But there is n't any ... we 've nothing except this spirit-lamp .<stage>Pointing to lamp on table .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>No women in the house ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>With humour that the doctor declines to see .</stage>Not one .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Controlling his exasperation .</stage>Never mind . I 'll run round to the surgery and get my hypodermic .<stage>To SHAWN , reassuringly and deferentially .</stage>I shall be back at once , Mr . Carve .<stage>To CARVE , near door .</stage>Keep your master well covered up — I suppose you can do that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Exit .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Shawn , my poor fellow , he takes you for the illustrious Ilam Carve . This is what comes of me rushing out in shirt sleeves .<stage>Gesture of despair .</stage>I can n't explain it to him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHAWN</speaker>
      <p>But ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>It 's all right . You 'll be infinitely better looked after , you know , and I shall be saved from their infernal curiosity .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SHAWN</speaker>
      <p>It 's only this , sir . I was half-expecting a young lady to-night , sir<stage>very feebly</stage>At least , I believe she 's young .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Shawn , I 've always suspected you were a bad lot . Now I know . I also know why you were so devilish anxious to put me to bed early . What am I to say to this young lady on your behalf ?</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>SHAWN worse , too ill to answer . Pause . Re-enter DR. PASCOE , very rapidly , with a large tumbler half-full of hot liquid .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>You may say I 've been quick .<stage>As he bends down to SHAWN , addressing CARVE .</stage>Get me a wine glass of clean cold water .<stage>To SHAWN .</stage>Now , please . I want you to drink a little brandy and water .<stage>SHAWN makes no response .</stage>By Jove !<stage>The doctor pours some of the brandy and water down SHAWN 'S throat .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Who has been wandering about vaguely .</stage>I do n't think we 've got a wine glass . There 's a cup , but I suppose that is n't medical enough .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Taking a syringe from his pocket and unscrewing it .</stage>Pour some water in it .<stage>CARVE obeys .</stage>Now , hold it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Indicating syringe .</stage>What is this device ? PASCOE . This device ? I 'm going to get some strychnine into him by injection . Steady with that cup , now !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Pascoe drops a tablet into the syringe and screws it up again , draws a little water up into the syringe and shakes the syringe . Then he goes to SHAWN to make the injection , on the top side of the patient 's forearm . CARVE still holds the cup out mechanically .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>I 've done with that cup .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Putting the cup down .</stage>Might I ask what 's the matter with him ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Pneumonia is the matter .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Noise of some one in the hall .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Startled .</stage>Surely that 's some one in the hall .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Keep perfectly calm , my man . It 's my assistant . I left the door open on purpose for him . He 's got the poultice and things .<stage>In a loud voice as he finishes the injection .</stage>Come along , come along there . This way .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Enter EDWARD HORNING with poultice , lint , bandages , etc . ) PASCOE . Found the antiphlogistine ?</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EDWARD</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>Yes .</l>
       <stage>He looks at patient , and exchanges a glance with PASCOE .</stage>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Where 's the bedroom ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>There 's one there .<stage>Pointing to double doors .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>To HORNING .</stage>We 'll get him into bed now .<stage>To CARVE .</stage>Bed ready ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Yes . I — I think he was just making it up .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Startled .</stage>Does he make up his own bed ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Perceiving the mistake , but resuming his calm .</stage>Always .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Controlling his astonishment ; looking through double doors and opening them wider . To HORNING .</stage>Yes , this will do . Put those things down here a minute while we lift him .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>PASCOE and HORNING then carry the inanimate form of SHAWN into the room behind , while CARVE hovers about uselessly .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Can I do anything ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Indicating a chair furthest away from the double doors .</stage>You see that chair ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I see it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Go and sit on it .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Exeunt PASCOE and HORNING , back , closing double door 's .</stage>
     <stage>After walking about , CARVE sits down on another chair . A bell rings twice . He pays no attention . Then enter JANET CANNOT , L. CARVE jumps up , but is inarticulate , though very favourably interested .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Smiling sympathetically .</stage>I rang twice .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>The bell must be out of order .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>I could n't be sure , but I do n't think it 's the bell that 's out of order .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Oh ! You think I 'm out of order .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>No . I was thinking that you 'd only just come into the house — all you famous folk — and you had n't quite got it straight yet — as it were .<stage>Looking vaguely at room .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>All we famous folk ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Well — I do n't know myself about that sort of thing .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>What sort of thing ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Picture-painting , is n't it ? I mean real pictures done by hand , coloured —— CARVE . Ah — yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>After a slight pause .</stage>It struck me all of a sudden , while I was waiting at the door , that it might have been left open on purpose .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>The front door ? On purpose ? What for ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Oh — for some one particular to walk in without any fuss . So in I stepped .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>You 're the young lady that Mr. Shawn 's expecting ——<stage>Going towards passage .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Stopping him .</stage>It 's shut now . You do n't want everybody walking in , do you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Looking at JANET with pleasure .</stage>So you 're the young lady — Mrs .— Miss ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Ignoring his question .</stage>Was it a message you had for me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>No , no . Not a message .... But — the fact is , we 're rather upset here for the moment .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Yes . Illness .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Now , if it is n't an indiscreet question , how did you know that there was illness ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>I was standing looking at this house and wondering whether I should n't do better to go right back home there and then . But “ No , ” I said , “ I 've begun , and I 'll go through with it . ” — Well , I was standing there when what should I see but a parlour maid pop up from the area steps next door , and she says to me over the railings , “ The doctor 's just been . ” Just like that , excited . So I said , “ Thank you , miss . ” I hope it 's nothing serious ?</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Pneumonia .</p>

      <p>Pneumonia . What a mercy !</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Mercy ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>If you look at it sensibly it 's about the best illness anybody could have in hot weather like this . You 've got to keep them warm . The weather does it for you . If it was typhoid now , and you 'd got to keep them cool — that would be awkward . Not but it passes me how anybody can catch pneumonia in August .</p>

      <p>Oh ! the Continent . It 's not Mr. Shawn that 's ill ?</p>

      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>And who told you that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Well !<stage>waves her hand to indicate the state of the room , smiling indulgently</stage>I always feel sorry for gentlemen when they have to manage for themselves , even if they 're well and hearty . But when it comes to illness — I can n't bear to think about it . Still , everybody has their own notions of comfort . And I 've no doubt he 'll very soon be better .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>You think he will ?</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Blandly cheerful .</stage>As a general rule , you may say that people do get better . That 's my experience . Of course sometimes they take a longish time . And now and then one dies — else what use would cemeteries be ? But as a general rule they 're soon over it . Now am I going to see Mr. Shawn , or shall I ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Well , if you could call again ——</p>

      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>On the contrary , I should like him to be treated with every care . He 's invaluable to me .</p>

      <p>Nervousness — nothing but nervousness . I 'm very nervous . And then — you know the saying — like master , like man .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Oh , very . Always was . Ever since I 've known him . You remember his first picture at the Academy ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>No , not exactly .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Either you remember it exactly or you do n't remember it at all . Life-size picture of a policeman blowing his whistle .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Yes ; it must have been odd , that must .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Not a bit . The oddness of the fellow ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>What ‘ fellow ’ — your governor ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Nods .</stage>His oddness came out in this way — although the thing had really a great success , from that day to this he 's never painted another life-size picture of a policeman blowing his whistle .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>I do n't see anything very odd there ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Do n't you ? Well , perhaps you do n't go in for art much . If you did , you 'd know that the usual and correct thing for a painter who has made a great success with a life-size picture of a policeman blowing his whistle , is to keep on doing life-size pictures of a policeman blowing his whistle for ever and ever , so that the public can always count on getting from him a life-size picture of a policeman blowing his whistle .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>I observe you are one of those comic valets . Nervousness again , no doubt .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Smiling and continuing .</stage>Seeing the way he invariably flouted the public , it 's always been a mystery to me how he managed to make a name , to say nothing of money .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Money ! He must make pots . You say I do n't go in for art much , but I always read the big sales at Christie 's . Why , was n't it that policeman picture that Lord Leonard Alcar bought for 2000 guineas last year ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>No , not Alcar . I think the bobby was last bought by Texel .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Texel ? Who 's Texel ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Collector — United States — one of their kings , I 'm told .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Oh , him ! Controls all the ink in the United States .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Really ! That 's what I should call influence . No . It was the “ Pelicans feeding their Young ” that Alcar bought . Four thousand . You 're getting mixed up .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Perhaps I am . I know I 'm constantly seeing Mr . Carve 's name in connection with Lord Leonard Alcar 's . It 's a nice question which is the best known of the two .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Then the — governor really is famous in England ? You see we never come to England .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Famous — I should think he was . Are n't they always saying he 's the finest colourist since Titian ? And look at his prices !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Yes . I 've looked at his prices . Titian 's prices are higher , but Titian is n't what you 'd call famous with the general public , is he ? What I want to know is — is the governor famous among the general public ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>No , it is n't . Is he as famous as — er — Harry Lauder ?</p>

      <p>Is he as famous as Harry Vardon ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Never heard of him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>I only see these names in the papers . Is he as famous as Bernard</l>
       <l>Shaw ?</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Yes , I should say he was .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Oh , well that 's not so bad . Better than I thought ! It 's so difficult to judge where one is — er — personally concerned . Especially if you 're never on the spot .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>So it 's true Mr . Carve never comes to England ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Why should he come to England ? He is n't a portrait painter . It 's true he owns this house , but surely that is n't sufficient excuse for living in a place like England ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Of course , if you look at it like that , there 's no particular attractiveness in England that I 've ever seen . But that answer would n't satisfy Redcliffe Gardens . Redcliffe Gardens is persuaded that there must be a special reason .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Well , there is .</p>

      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Really ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Well , you see we 're more like brothers — been together so long . He gives me his best suits too . Look at this waistcoat .<stage>Motions the hypnotised PASCOE to take a chair . They light their cigarettes .</stage></p>

     <stage>Enter HORNING .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Somewhat impatient .</stage>He 's not worse already ?</p>

     </sp>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>To Carve with renewed eagerness .</stage>So there is a special reason why you keep out of England .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Yes — shyness .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>How — shyness ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Just simple shyness . Shyness is a disease with the governor , a perfect disease .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>But everyone 's shy . The more experience I get the more convinced</l>
       <l>I am that we 're all shy . Why , you were shy when you came to fetch me !</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Did you notice it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Of course . And I was shy when I came in here . I was thinking to myself , “ Now I 'm going to see the great Ilam Carve actually in the flesh , ” and I was shy . You 'd think my profession would have cured me of being shy , but not a bit . Nervous disease , of course ! Ought to be treated as such . Almost universal . Besides , even if he is shy , your governor — even if he 's a hundredfold shy , that 's no reason for keeping out of England . Shyness is not one of those diseases you can cure by change of climate .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Pardon me . My esteemed employer 's shyness is a special shyness . He 's only shy when he has to play the celebrity . So long as people take him for no one in particular he 's quite all right . For instance , he 's never shy with me . But instantly people approach him as the celebrity , instantly he sees in the eye of the beholder any consciousness of being in the presence of a toff — then he gets desperately shy , and his one desire is to be alone at sea or to be buried somewhere deep in the bosom of the earth .<stage>PASCOE laughs .</stage>What are you laughing at ?<stage>CARVE also laughs .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Go on , go on . I 'm enjoying it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>No , but seriously ! It 's true what I tell you . It amounts almost to a tragedy in the brilliant career of my esteemed . You see now that England would be impossible for him as a residence . You see , do n't you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Quite .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Why , even on the Continent , in the big towns and the big hotels , we often travel incognito for safety . It 's only in the country districts that he goes about under his own name .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>So that he 's really got no friends ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>None , except a few Italian and Spanish peasants — and me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Well , well ! It 's an absolute mania then , this shyness .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Slightly hurt .</stage>Oh , not so bad as that ! And then it 's only fair to say he has his moments of great daring — you may say rashness .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>All timid people are like that .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Are they ?<stage>Musing .</stage>We 're here now owing to one of his moments of rashness .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Indeed !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Yes . We met an English lady in a village in Andalusia , and — well , of course , I can n't tell you everything — but she flirted with him and he flirted with her .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Under his own name ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Yes . And then he proposed to her . I knew all along it was a blunder .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Ironic .</stage>Did you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Yes . She belonged to the aristocracy , and she was one of those amateur painters that wander about the Continent by themselves — you know .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>And did she accept ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Oh yes . They got as far as Madrid together , and then all of a sudden my esteemed saw that he had made a mistake .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>And what then ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>We fled the country . We hooked it . The idea of coming to London struck him — just the caprice of a man who 's lost his head — and here we are .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>After a pause .</stage>He does n't seem to me from the look of him to be a man who 'd — shall we say ?— strictly avoided women .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Startled , with a gesture towards back .</stage>Him ?<stage>PASCOE nods .</stage>Really ! Confound him ! Now I 've always suspected that ; though he manages to keep his goings-on devilish quiet .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Rising .</stage>It occurs to me , my friend , that I 'm listening to too much . But you 're so persuasive .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>It 's such a pleasure to talk freely — for once in a way .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Freely — is the word .</p>

     <stage>Enter HORNING .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HORNING</speaker>
      <p><stage>To Carve .</stage>I say , it 's just occurred to me , Mr . Carve has n't been digging or gardening or anything , I suppose , and then taken cold after ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Digging ? Oh no . He must have got a bad chill on the steamer . Why ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HORNING</speaker>
      <p>Nothing . Only his hands and finger-nails are so rough .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>After thinking .</stage>Oh , I see ! All artists are like that . Messing about with paints and acids and things . Look at my hands .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>But are you an artist too ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Recovering himself , calmly .</stage>No , no .</p>

      <p><stage>To Horning .</stage>How 's he going on ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HORNING</speaker>
      <p><stage>Shrugs his shoulders .</stage>I 'm sure the base of both lungs is practically solid .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Well , we can n't do more than we have done , my boy .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HORNING</speaker>
      <p>He 'll never pull through .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Calmly .</stage>I should certainly be surprised if he did .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Astounded .</stage>But — but ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>But what ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>You do n't mean to say — Why , he 's a strong healthy man !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Precisely . Not very unusual for your strong healthy man to die of pneumonia in twenty-four hours . You ought to know , at your age , that it 's a highly dangerous thing to be strong and healthy .<stage>Turning away .</stage>I 'll have another look at him before I go .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Extremely perturbed .</stage>But this is ridiculous . I simply do n't know what I shall do without that man . The stage is darkened for a few moments to indicate passage of time .</p>

      <speaker>TIME</speaker>
      <p>— The next morning but one . Slightly less disorder in the room . CARVE and PASCOE are together , the latter ready to leave .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Will there have to be an inquest ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Inquest ? Of course not .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>It 's some relief to know that . I could n't have faced a coroner .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Staring at him .</stage>Perfectly ordinary case .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>That 's what you call perfectly ordinary , is it ? A man is quite well on Tuesday afternoon , and dead at 4 a. m. on Thursday morning .<stage>Looking at his watch .</stage>My watch has stopped .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>With fierce sarcasm .</stage>One of those cheap German watches , I suppose , that stop when you do n't wind them up ! It 's a singular thing that when people stay up all night they take it for granted their watches are just as excited as they are . Look here , you 'll be collapsing soon . When did you have anything to eat last ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Almost half an hour ago . Two sausages that were sent in yesterday for the nurse .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>She 's gone ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Oh yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Well , take my advice . Try to get some sleep now . You 've had no reply from the relatives — the auctioneer cousin — what 's his Christian name — Cyrus ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>No , I — I did n't telegraph — I forgot ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Well , upon my soul ! I specially reminded you yesterday afternoon .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I did n't know the address .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Ever heard of the London Directory ? You 'd better run out and wire instantly . You do n't seem to realize that the death of a man like Ilam Carve will make something of a stir in the world . And you may depend on it that whether they 'd quarrelled or not , Cyrus Carve will want to know why he was n't informed of the illness at once . You 've let yourself in for a fine row , and well you deserve it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>After a few paces .</stage>See here , doctor . I 'm afraid there 's been some mistake .<stage>Facing him nervously .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>What ? CARVE . I — I ——</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Bell rings .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Firmly .</stage>Listen to me , my man . There 's been no sort of mistake . Everything has been done that could be done . Do n't you get ideas into your head . Lie down and rest . You 're done up , and if you are n't careful you 'll be ill . I 'll communicate with Cyrus Carve . I can telephone , and while I 'm about it I 'll ring up the registrar too — he 'll probably send a clerk round .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Registrar ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Registrar of deaths . There 'll be all kinds of things to attend to .<stage>Moving to go out .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Bell rings again .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>As if dazed .</stage>Is that the front door bell ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Drily .</stage>Quite possibly ! I 'll open it .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Exit .</stage>
     <stage>CARVE , alone , makes a gesture of despair . Re-enter PASCOE with CYRUS CARVE .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>As they enter .</stage>Yes , very sudden , very sudden . There were three of us — a nurse , my assistant , and myself . This is Mr. Shawn , the deceased 's valet .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p>Morning .<stage>Looks round at disorder of room contemptuously .</stage>Pigstye !... My name is Cyrus Carve . I 'm your late master 's cousin and his only relative . You 've possibly never heard of me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Curtly .</stage>Oh yes , I have ! You got up a great quarrel when you were aged twelve , you and he .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p>Your manner is n't very respectful , my friend . However you may have treated my cousin , be good enough to remember you 're not my valet .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>How did you get to know about it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p>I suppose he forbade you to send for me , eh ?<stage>Pause .</stage>Eh ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Jumping at this suggestion .</stage>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>So that was it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p><stage>Ignoring PASCOE .</stage>Ha ! Well , since you 're so curious , I saw it a quarter of an hour ago in a special edition of a halfpenny rag ; I was on my way to the office .<stage>Showing paper .</stage>Here you are ! The Evening Courier . Quite a full account of the illness . You could n't send for me , but you could chatter to some journalist .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I 've never spoken to a journalist in my life .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p>Then how ——?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>It 's probably my assistant . His brother is something rather important on the Courier , and he may have telephoned to him . It 's a big item of news , you know , Mr . Carve .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p><stage>Drily .</stage>I imagine so . Where is the body ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Upstairs .<stage>Moving towards door .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p>Thanks . I will go alone .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>Large room at back — first floor .<stage>Exit CYRUS , L .</stage>I think I 'd prefer to leave you to yourselves now . Of course , Mr . Carve will do all that 's necessary . You might give him my card , and tell him I 'm at his service as regards signing the death certificate and so on .<stage>Handing card .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>

       <l>Very well . Then you 're going ?</l>
       <l>PASCOE . Yes .</l>
       <stage>Moves away and then suddenly puts out his hand , which CARVE takes .</stage>
       <l>Want a word of advice ?</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I — I ought ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASCOE</speaker>
      <p>If I were you I should try to get something better than valeting . It 's not your line . You may have suited Ilam Carve , but you 'd never suit an ordinary employer . You are n't a fool — not by any means .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>CARVE shrugs his shoulders .</stage>
     <stage>Exit PASCOE , L. Door shuts off .</stage>
     <stage>Re-enter CYRUS immediately after the door shuts .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>To himself .</stage>Now for it !<stage>To CYRUS</stage>Well ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p>Well what ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Recognize your cousin ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p>Of course a man of forty-five is n't like a boy of twelve , but I think I may say I should have recognized him anywhere .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Taken aback .</stage>Should you indeed .<stage>A pause .</stage>And so you 're Cyrus , the little boy that kicked and tried to bite in that historic affray of thirty years ago .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p>Look here , I fancy you and I had better come to an understanding at once . What salary did my cousin pay you for your remarkable services ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>What salary ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p>What salary ?</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>What bank ? He did n't keep them in any bank .</p>
     </sp>

      <p>Where did he keep them then ?</p>

      <p>Do you know what it is ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Yes . It 's a will that was made in Venice I do n't know how long ago — just after your aunt died and you had that appalling and final shindy by correspondence about the lease of this house . Everything is left for the establishment of an International Gallery of Painting and Sculpture in London , and you 're the sole executor , and you get a legacy of five pounds for your trouble .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p>Yes .... So I see . No doubt my cousin imagined it would annoy me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>He did .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p>He told you so ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>He said it would be one in the eye for you — and he wondered whether you 'd decline the executorship .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p>Well , my man , I may tell you at once that I shall not renounce probate . I never expected a penny from my cousin . I always assumed he 'd do something silly with his money , and I 'm relieved to find it 's no worse . In fact , the idea of a great public institution in London being associated with my family is rather pleasant .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>But he meant to destroy that will long since .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p><stage>As he cons the will .</stage>How do you know ? Has he made a later will ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>No .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p>Well , then ! Besides , I fail to see why you should be so anxious to have it destroyed . You come into eighty pounds a year under it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I was forgetting that .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p><stage>Reading .</stage>“ I bequeath to my servant , Albert Shawn , who I am convinced is a thorough rascal , but who is an unrivalled valet , courier , and factotum , the sum of eighty pounds a year for life , payable quarterly in advance , provided he is in my service at the time of my death . ”<stage>CARVE laughs shortly .</stage>You do n't want to lose that , do you ? Of course , if the term “ thorough rascal ” is offensive to you , you can always decline the money .<stage>Folds up will and puts it in his pocket — CARVE walks about .</stage>Now where 's the doctor ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>He 's left his card . There it is .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p>He might have waited .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Yes . But he did n't . His house is only three doors off .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p><stage>Looking at his watch .</stage>I 'll go in and see him about the certificate . Now you have n't begun to put your things together , and you 've only got a bit over half an hour . In less than that time I shall be back . I shall want to look through your luggage before you leave .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Lightly .</stage>Shall you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p>By the way , you have a latchkey ?<stage>CARVE nods .</stage>Give it me , please .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>CARVE surrenders latchkey .</stage>
     <stage>CYRUS turns to go — As he is disappearing through the door , L ., CARVE starts forward .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I say .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p>What now ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Subsiding weakly .</stage>Nothing .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Exit CYRUS . Sound of front door opening and of voices in hall .</stage>
     <stage>Then re-enter CYRUS with JANET CANNOT .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p>This is Mr. Albert Shawn . Shawn , a friend of yours .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Exit L .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Pleased .</stage>Oh ! You !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Good-morning . D'you know , I had a suspicion the other night that you must be Mr. Shawn ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Had you ? Well , will you sit down — er — I say<stage>with a humorous mysterious air</stage>What do you think of that chap ?<stage>Pointing in direction of hall .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Who is it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>It 's Mr. Cyrus Carve . The great West End auctioneer .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Sound of front-door shutting rather too vigorously .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Well , I see no reason why he should look at me as if I 'd insulted him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Did he ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>“ Good-morning , ” I said to him . “ Excuse me , but are you Mr. Albert</l>
       <l>Shawn ? ” Because I was n't sure , you know . And he looked .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>After laughing .</stage>The man is an ass .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Is he ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Not content with being an ass merely , he is a pompous and a stupid ass .<stage>Laughs again to himself .</stage>Now there is something very important that he ought to know , and he would n't let me tell him . JANET . Really ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Yes , very important . But no . He would n't let me tell him . And perhaps if I 'd told him he would n't have believed me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>What did he do to stop you from telling him ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>At a loss , vaguely .</stage>I do n't know — Would n't let me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>If you ask me , I should say the truth is , you did n't want to tell him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Impressed .</stage>Now I wonder if you 're right .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Well , I do n't quite see how anybody can stop anybody from talking . But even if he did , he can n't stop you from writing to him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>No , I 'm hanged if I write to him !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Oh , well , that 's a proof you did n't want to tell him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Perhaps it is .<stage>After a burst of quiet laughter .</stage>Pardon me .<stage>Reflective .</stage>I was only thinking what a terrific lark it will be .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>If he never does get to know ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>If he never does get to know . If nobody ever gets to know .<stage>Resolved .</stage>No . I 'll keep my mouth shut .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>As a general rule , it 's the best thing to do .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>You advise me to keep my mouth shut ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Not at all . I simply say , as a general rule it 's the best thing to do . But this is no business of mine , and I 'm sure I 'm not inquisitive .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <lg>
       <stage>Solemnly .</stage>
       <l>He shall go his own way .</l>
       <stage>Pause .</stage>
       <l>And</l>
       <l>I 'll — go — mine .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Calmly indifferent .</stage>That 's settled , then .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Laughs again to himself , then controls his features .</stage>And that being settled , the first thing I have to do is to apologize for my behaviour on Tuesday night .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Oh , not at all . Seeing how upset you were ! And then I 'm not sure whether I should n't have done the same thing myself in your place .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Done the same yourself ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Well , I may be wrong , but it occurred to me your idea was that you 'd like to have a look at me before giving yourself away , as it were . Of course , I sent you my photographs , but photographs are n't much better than gravestones — for being reliable , and some folks are prejudiced against matrimonial agencies , even when they make use of them . It 's natural . Now I 've got no such prejudice . If you want to get married you want to get married , and there you are . It 's no use pretending you do n't . And there 's as much chance of being happy through a matrimonial agency as any other way . At least — that 's what I think .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Collecting his wits .</stage>Just so .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>You may tell me that people who go to a matrimonial agency stand a chance of getting let in . Well , people who do n't go to a matrimonial agency stand a chance of getting let in , too . Besides , I should n't give a baby a razor for a birthday present , and I should n't advise a young girl to go to a matrimonial agency . But I 'm not a young girl . If it 's a question of the male sex , I may say that I 've been there before . You understand me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Quite .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Well , I think I told you pretty nearly everything important in my letter . Did n't I ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Let me see now ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>I mean the one I sent to the office of the Matrimonial News .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Mechanically feeling in his pockets , pulling out papers and putting them back .</stage>Where did I put it ? Oh , perhaps it 's in the pocket of another coat .<stage>Goes to a coat of SHAWN 'S hanging on inner knob of double doors , and empties all the pockets , bringing the contents , including a newspaper , to the table .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Picking up an envelope .</stage>Yes , that 's it — I can feel the photograph . You seem to keep things in the pockets of all your coats .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>If you knew what I 've been through this last day or two ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Soothingly .</stage>Yes , yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I have n't had a quiet moment . Now ——<stage>Reading letter .</stage>“ Dear Sir , in reply to your advertisement , I write to you with particulars of my case . I am a widow , aged thirty-two years —— ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>And anybody that likes can see my birth certificate . That 's what</l>
       <l>I call talking .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>My dear lady !<stage>Continuing to read .</stage>“ Thirty-two years . My father was a jobbing builder , well known in Putney and Wandsworth . My husband was a rent collector and estate agent . He died four years ago of appendicitis<stage>hesitating</stage>caught —— ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Caused .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I beg pardon , “ — caused by accidentally swallowing a bristle out of his tooth-brush , the same being discovered at the operation . I am an orphan , a widow , and have no children . In consequence I feel very lonely , and my first experience not being distasteful , indeed the reverse , I am anxious to try again , provided I can meet with a sincere helpmeet of good family . I am the owner of the above house , rated at forty-five pounds a year , in one of the nicest streets in Putney , and I have private means of some three pounds a week , from brewery shares bringing in fifteen per cent . I will say nothing about my appearance , but enclose latest carte-de-visite photograph . ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>I had it taken on purpose .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>“ As to my tastes , I will only say that as a general rule they are quiet . If the above seems in your line , I shall be obliged if you will write and send me particulars of yourself , with photographs .— Yours truly , JANET CANNOT . ” Well , Mrs . Cannot , your letter is an absolute model .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>I suppose you did get dozens ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Well —— By the way , what 's this type-written thing in the envelope ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Looking at it .</stage>It looks like a copy of your answer .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Oh !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>If it is n't a rude question , Mr. Shawn , why do you typewrite your letters ? It seems so — what shall I say ?— public .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Half to himself .</stage>So thats the explanation of the typewriter .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Puzzled .</stage>I suppose it 's because you 're a private secretary .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Equally puzzled .</stage>Private secretary ! I — shall we just glance through my reply ?<stage>Reads .</stage>“ My dear Mrs . Cannot , your letter inspires me with more confidence than any of the dozens of others I have received . ”<stage>They look at each other , smiling .</stage>“ As regards myself , I should state at once that I am and have been for many years private secretary , indeed I may say almost companion , to the celebrated painter . Mr. Ilam Carve , whose magnificent pictures you are doubtless familiar with . ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>No , I 'm not .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Really . “ We have been knocking about England together for longer than I care to remember , and I personally am anxious for a change . Our present existence is very expensive . I feel the need of a home and the companionship of just such a woman as yourself . Although a bachelor , I think I am not unfitted for the domestic hearth . My age is forty . ” That 's a mistake of the typewriter .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Oh !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Forty-five it ought to be .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Well , honestly , I should n't have thought it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>“ My age is forty-five . By a strange coincidence Mr . Carve has suggested to me that we set out for England to-morrow . At Dover I will telegraph you with a rendezvous . In great haste . Till then , my dear Mrs . Cannot , believe me , ” etc .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>You did n't send a photograph .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Perhaps I was afraid of prejudicing you in advance .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Laughs .</stage>Eh , Mr. Shawn ! There 's thousands of young gentlemen alive and kicking in London this minute that would give a great deal to be only half as good looking as you are . And so you 're a bachelor ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Oh , quite .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Two bachelors , as you say , knocking about Europe together .<stage>CARVE laughs quietly but heartily to himself .</stage>By the way , how is Mr . Carve ? I hope he 's better .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Mr . Carve ?...<stage>Suddenly stops laughing .</stage>Oh !<stage>Lamely , casually .</stage>He 's dead !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Stocked .</stage>Dead ? When ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Early this morning .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Rising .</stage>And us chattering away like this . Why did n't you tell me at once , Mr. Shawn ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I forgot for the moment . I was n't thinking ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Forgot ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Simply and sincerely , but very upset .</stage>Now , Mrs . Cannot , I assure you I feel that man 's death . I admit I had very little affection for him — certainly not much respect — but we 'd been together a long time , and his death is a shock to me . Yes , really . But I 've had to think so much about my own case — and then a scene , a regular scene with Cyrus Carve . And then you coming . The fact is ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Sympathetically .</stage>The fact is , you scarcely know what you 're doing , my poor Mr. Shawn . You 're on wires , that 's what 's the matter with you — hysteria . I know what it is as well as anybody . You 'll excuse me saying so , but you 're no ordinary man . You 're one of these highly-strung people and you ought to take care of yourself . Well , I 'll go now , and if it 's mutually agreeable we might perhaps meet again in a month 's time — say .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>A month ? But what am I to do with myself for a month ? Do you know you 're absolutely the only friend I 've got in London — in England . We 're never here . I 'm an utter stranger . You can n't leave me like that — for a month — four weeks — four Sundays . I have n't the least idea what 's going to happen to me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>The very best thing that can happen to you is bed . You go to bed and stop there for a couple of days . There 's nothing like it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Yes , but where ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Why , here of course .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I 've got to be out of this place in half an hour , less . The fact is , Cyrus Carve has been extremely — er — pert . He 's paid me a month 's salary and I 'm off at once . In under thirty minutes I shall be on the streets .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>I never liked that man . Well , then , you must go to some nice respectable boarding-house .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>But I do n't know any nice respectable boarding-house .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>Oh ! There are thousands and thousands in London . Look in the</l>

     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I have n't had a paper to-day .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Any day will do . They 're in all the papers every day . What 's this ?<stage>Taking up folded dirty newspaper and opening it .</stage>Now , let 's see . Well , what about this ? “ A beautiful private hotel of the highest class . Luxuriously furnished . Visitors ’ comfort studied . Finest position in London . Cuisine a speciality . Suitable for persons of superior rank . Bathroom . Electric light . Separate tables . No irritating extras . Single rooms from two and a half guineas . 250 Queen 's Gate . ” Quite close by !<stage>CARVE says nothing .</stage>Perhaps that 's a bit dear . Here 's another . “ Not a boarding-house . A magnificent mansion . Forty bedrooms by Waring . Superb public saloons by Maple . Parisian chef . Separate tables . Four bathrooms . Card-rooms . Billiard room . Vast lounge . Special sanitation . Young , cheerful , musical society . Bridge<stage>small</stage>Finest position in London . No irritating extras . Single rooms from two guineas . ” What about that ?</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>I wo n't say but what two guineas a week is a lot .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>And I was thinking how cheap it was .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Staring .</stage>Well , of course , if you 've got money to fling about .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Upon my soul I do n't know what money I have got .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>It 'll be just as well to find out before you get into the street .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Let 's see . Well , there 's seven pounds<stage>showing it .</stage>and this<stage>pulling silver and gold from another pocket</stage>Not much is it ? Sixteen shillings and sixpence . It 's true I 've an annuity of eighty pounds . I was forgetting that .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Pleased .</stage>Have you indeed ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Yes . But an annuity is n't ready cash , is it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Picking up Shawn 's pocket-book .</stage>And this ? This seems rather thick .</p>

      <p>I was forgetting that too .<stage>Opens it and takes out many notes .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>My word ! And you 'd forgotten that ! You ought to see a doctor .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Counting .</stage>Twenty-one fives , and ten tens . That makes two hundred and five pounds .<stage>Half to himself .</stage>I always knew I was a bad lot — but where did I collar all that from ?<stage>To Janet .</stage>I know what I shall do ! I shall go to the Grand Babylon .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>The Grand Babylon Hotel ? But it 's the dearest hotel in London .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>In the big towns we always went to the best hotel . It 's cheapest in the end .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>You 're very persuasive , but you 'll never make me believe you 'll save money by staying at the Grand Babylon .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p><stage>Rising and beginning to collect things — tries to fold up a pair of trousers .</stage>Now , Mrs . Cannot , will you do me a favour ?</p>

      <p>You 'll spoil these trousers .</p>

      <p>But I 've never been in such a place in my life .</p>

      <p>I 'm really delighted to see you .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I 'm not . Perhaps it 's these sleepless nights I 've had .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>You 're shivering .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I was wearing my dressing-gown . I nearly always do when I 'm alone . Do you think you 'd mind if I put it on again .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Do you mean to say you took it off because of me ?<stage>Seizing dressing-gown firmly .</stage>Mr. Shawn , will you oblige me by getting-into this at once ?<stage>She helps him on with dressing-gown .</stage>What a beauty !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Yes . Cousin Cyrus thought so too . He did n't want me to bring it away . Still , I beat him on that point .<stage>JANET arranges the collar .</stage>Do you know , you do me good .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>I should think so . I suppose when gentlemen live alone they 're pretty nearly always unwell , as it were . If it is n't a cold , it 's stomach , I expect . And truly , I 'm not surprised , the way they go on ! Now , will you sit down in that chair and keep your legs covered — August or no August ! If you ask me , it 's influenza you 're sickening for .<stage>Sound of distant orchestral .</stage>Music ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Nodding and sitting down in easy chair .</stage>Well , and what 's the news from outside ? I have n't stirred since yesterday noon .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Seems to me there 's no news except your Mr . Carve 's death .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Really ! Is it so much talked about as all that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>It 's on all the posters — very big . All along Piccadilly and Trafalgar Square and the Strand the newspaper boys , and the newspaper old men too , are wearing it like aprons , as it were . I read the Telegraph myself . There was nearly a page of it in the Telegraph .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Staggered .</stage>Nearly a page of it in the Telegraph !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Yes , besides a leading article . Have n't you ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I never read obituaries of artists in the papers .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Neither do I . But I should have thought you would .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Well , they make me angry . Obituaries of archbishops are n't so bad . Newspapers seem to understand archbishops . But when they begin about artists — you cannot imagine the astounding nonsense they talk .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Protesting against his heat .</stage>Now ! You 're still all on wires . Why should that make you angry ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>What did the Telegraph say ? Did you look at it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Oh yes . It appears Mr . Carve was a very eccentric person — avoiding society and so on .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Resentful .</stage>Eccentric ! There you are ! He was n't eccentric in the least . The only society he avoided was the society of gaping fools .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Well , I 'm just telling you what it said . Then , let me see — what else did it say ? Oh ! It said the sole question was whether Mr . Carve was the greatest painter since Velasquez — is that how you pronounce it ?— or whether he was the greatest painter that ever lived .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Interested .</stage>Really ! It said that ?</p>

      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Nodding .</stage>You ought to read it .</p>

      <p>What am I to say ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Tell them to send me up the daily papers at once .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Certainly .</p>

      <p>So this is the Grand Babylon Hotel ? Well it 's a queer place .<stage>Her eyes rove round the room .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>What are you looking for ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>To speak plainly , I was looking for the bed . I must say I was rather surprised when the young man at the desk said I was to go up to your room .... But really , every thing 's so nicely arranged .... I suppose it 's one of those folding beds that turn into bookcases and things ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Laughs .</stage>No . This is my sitting-room .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Your sitting-room ?<stage>Pointing to door , R .</stage>Then that 's the bedroom ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Pointing to another door .</stage>And what 's that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>That 's one way to my bathroom . In a big hotel I always take a suite , you know . It 's so much more comfortable .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Is n't it rather expensive ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>To tell you the truth , I did n't ask the price .</p>

      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Why ?

     </sp>

     </sp>

      <p>What is that music ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

     </sp>
     <stage>Telephone bell rings .</stage>
     <sp>

      <p>Never mind it . Let ‘ em ring . I understand now why journalists and so on have been trying all day to see me . Honestly I 'm — I 'm staggered .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Telephone bell continues to ring .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>It 's a funny notion of comfort having a telephone in every room . How long will it keep on like that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p>Now shyness is a thing I simply can n't understand . I 'm never shy . And you do n't strike me as shy — far from it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>It 's very curious . I have n't felt a bit shy with you .</p>

      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Nobody ever is shy with me ....<stage>Ironically .</stage>I must say I 'd give something to see you shy .</p>

     <stage>Enter FATHER LOOE and HONORIA LOOE , announced by PAGE . ) LOOE . ( Stopping near door , at a loss . ) Pardon me — Mr. Shawn — Mr. Albert Shawn ?</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Rising , perturbed .</stage>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOOE</speaker>
      <p>This is your room ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOOE</speaker>
      <p>I 'm afraid there 's some mistake . I was given to understand that you were the — er — valet of the late Mr. Ilam Carve .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HONORIA</speaker>
      <p>Yes . Mr. Cyrus Carve told us ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Coming to CARVE 'S rescue as he remains speechless , very calmly .</stage>Now there 's another trick of Mr. Cyrus Carve 's ! Valet indeed ! Mr. Shawn was Mr . Carve 's secretary — and almost companion .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOOE</speaker>
      <p>Ten thousand apologies . Ten thousand apologies . I felt sure ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Please sit down .<stage>With special gallantry towards HONORIA .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>And will you sit down too , Mr. Shawn ?<stage>To the LOOES .</stage>He 's not at all well . That 's why he 's wearing his dressing-gown .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Introducing .</stage>My friend , Mrs. Janet Cannot .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOOE</speaker>
      <p>Now , Mr. Shawn , if you knew anything about me , if you have heard me preach , if you have read any of my books , you are probably aware that I am a man who goes straight to the point , hating subtleties . In connection with your late employer 's death a great responsibility is laid upon me , and I have come to you for information — information which I have failed to obtain either from Mr. Cyrus Carve , or the doctor , or the nurse .... Was Mr . Carve a Catholic ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>A Catholic ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOOE</speaker>
      <p>He came of a Catholic family did he not ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Yes — I believe so .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOOE</speaker>
      <p>The cousin , Mr. Cyrus Carve , I regret to say , denies the faith of his childhood — denies it , I also regret to say , with a vivacity that amounts almost to bad manners . In fact , he was extremely rude to me when I tried to give him some idea of the tremendous revival of Catholicism which is the outstanding feature of intellectual life in England to-day .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Ilam Carve was not a Catholic .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOOE</speaker>
      <p>Mind , I do not ask if he died in the consolations of the faith . I know that he did not . I have learnt that it occurred to neither you nor the doctor nor the nurse to send for a priest . Strange omission . But not the fault of the dying man .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Ilam Carve was not a Catholic .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOOE</speaker>
      <p>Then what was he ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Nothing in particular .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOOE</speaker>
      <p>Then I claim him . Then I claim him .... Honoria !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>In a new tone ..</stage>Look here — what 's all this about ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Rising .</stage>I will tell you at once what it is about , Mr. Shawn . There is a question of Ilam Carve being buried in Westminster Abbey .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Thunderstruck .</stage>Buried in Westminster Abbey ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOOK</speaker>
      <p>Lady Leonard Alcar has consulted me about the matter . I may say that I have the honour to be her spiritual director . Probably you know that Lord Leonard Alcar owns the finest collection of Ilam Carve 's pictures in Europe .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>I 've often wondered who it is that settles whether people shall be buried in the Abbey or not . So it 's Lady Leonard Alcar !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOOE</speaker>
      <p>Not exactly ! Not exactly ! But Lady Leonard Alcar is a great lady . She has vast influence . The most influential convert to Catholicism of the last thirty years . She is aunt to no less than four dukes , and Lord Leonard is uncle to two others .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Ironically .</stage>I quite see .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Eagerly .</stage>You see — do n't you ? Her advice on these matters carries enormous weight . A suggestion from her amounts to — to —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>A decree absolute .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Simply .</stage>Is she what they call the ruling classes ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Bows .</stage>Lady Leonard and I have talked the matter over , and I pointed out to her that if this great genius was a member of the Church of England and if the sorrowing nation at large deems him worthy of the supreme honour of a national funeral , then by all means let him be buried in the Abbey . But if he was a Catholic , then I claim him for Westminster Cathedral , that magnificent fane which we have raised as a symbol of our renewed vitality . Now , was he a member of the Church of England ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Loudly .</stage>Decidedly not .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOOE</speaker>
      <p>Good ! Then I claim him . I detest casuistry and I claim him . I have only one other question . You knew him well — intimately — for many years . On your conscience , Mr. Shawn , what interment in your opinion would he himself have preferred ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>After a pause .</stage>It would n't make much difference to him either way , would it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>With an outburst .</stage>The whole thing is preposterous .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Ignoring the outburst .</stage>My course seems quite clear . I shall advise Lady Leonard —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Do n't you think you 're rather young to be in sole charge of this country ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Smoothly .</stage>My dear sir , I am nothing but a humble priest who gives counsel when counsel is sought . And I may say that in this affair of the interment of our great national painter , there are other influences than mine . For instance , my sister , Honoria , who happens also to be president of the Ladies ’ Water Colour Society —<stage>gesture of alarm from CARVE</stage>— my sister has a great responsibility . She is the favourite niece of —<stage>Whispers in CARVE 'S ear .</stage>Consequently —<stage>Makes an impressive pause .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HONORIA</speaker>
      <p>You see my uncle is a bachelor and I keep house for him . Anselm used to live with us too , until he left the Church .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOOE</speaker>
      <p>Until I joined the Church , Honoria . Now Honoria wishes to be perfectly fair ; she entirely realizes her responsibility ; and that is why she has come with me to see you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <lg>
       <stage>Benignantly .</stage>
       <l>So that 's how these things are decided ! I see</l>
       <l>I 'd got quite a wrong notion of politics and so on .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HONORIA</speaker>
      <p>Oh , Mr. Shawn — } and }<stage>Together .</stage>JANET . My idea was — }</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>I beg your pardon .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HONORIA</speaker>
      <p>I beg yours .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Granted .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HONORIA</speaker>
      <p>There 's one question I should so like to ask you , Mr. Shawn . In watercolours did Mr . Carve use Chinese white freely or did he stick to transparent colour , like the old English school ? I wonder if you understand me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Interested .</stage>He used Chinese white like anything .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HONORIA</speaker>
      <p>Oh ! I 'm so glad . You remember that charming water-colour of the Venetian gondolier in the Luxembourg . We had a great argument after we got home last Easter as to whether the oar was put in with Chinese white — or just ‘ left out , ’ you know !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Chinese white , of course . My notion is that it does n't matter a fig how you get effects so long as you do get them .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HONORIA</speaker>
      <p>And that was his notion too ?<stage>Telephone bell rings , JANET answers it .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>His ? Rather . You bet it was .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HONORIA</speaker>
      <p>I 'm so glad . I 'm so glad . I knew I was right about Chinese white . Oh , Anselm , do let him be buried in the Abbey ! Do let me suggest to uncle ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOOE</speaker>
      <p>My dear girl , ask your conscience . Enthusiasm for art I can comprehend ; I can even sympathize with it . But if this grave national question is to be decided by considerations of Chinese white ——</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>CARVE turns to JANET as if for succour .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Calmly .</stage>The doctor is just coming up .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>The doctor ? What doctor ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>A Dr. Horning . He says he 's Dr. Pascoe 's assistant and he attended Mr . Carve , and he wants to see you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>But I do n't want to see him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>You 'll have to see a doctor .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Why ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Because you 're ill . So you may just as well see this one as another . They 're all pretty much of a muchness .</p>
     </sp>

      <p><stage>Glancing helplessly at JANET .</stage>But this is n't the doctor ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PETER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Volubly .</stage>Admitted ! Admitted ! I 'm only his brother — a journalist . I 'm on the Courier and the Mercury and several other Worgan papers . One of our chaps failed to get into this room this morning , so I came along to try what I could do . You see what I 've done .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Well , I never came across such a set of people in my life .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PETER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Aside to LOOE .</stage>Is he in service here , or what ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOOE</speaker>
      <p>Mr. Shawn was Mr . Carve 's secretary and companion , not his valet .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PETER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Puzzled , but accepting the situation .</stage>Ah ! So much the better . Now , Mr. Shawn , can you tell me authoritatively whether shortly before his death Mr . Carve was engaged to be married under romantic circumstances to a lady of high rank ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HONORIA</speaker>
      <p>Indeed !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Who told you that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PETER</speaker>
      <p>Then he was !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I 've nothing to say .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PETER</speaker>
      <p>You wo n't tell me her name ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I 've nothing to say .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PETER</speaker>
      <p>Secondly , I 'm instructed to offer something considerable for your signature to an account of Ilam Carve 's eccentric life on the Continent .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Eccentric life on the Continent !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PETER</speaker>
      <p>I should n't keep you half an hour — three quarters at most . A hundred pounds . Cash down , you know . Bank notes . All you have to do is to sign .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>To Janet , exhausted , but disdainful .</stage>I would n't mind signing an order for the fellow 's execution .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PETER</speaker>
      <p>A hundred and fifty !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Or burning at the stake .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PETER</speaker>
      <p><stage>To LOOE .</stage>What does he say ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOOE</speaker>
      <p>Mr. Shawn is indisposed . We 've just been discussing the question of the burial in the Abbey . I think I may say , if it interests you as an item of news , that Ilam Carve will not be buried in the Abbey .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PETER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Lightly .</stage>Oh yes he will , Father . There was a little doubt about it until we got particulars of his will this morning . But his will settled it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOOE</speaker>
      <p>His will ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PETER</speaker>
      <p>Yes . Did n't you know ? No , you would n't . Well , his estate will come out at about a couple of hundred thousand , and he 's left it practically all for an International Gallery of Modern Art in London . Very ingenious plan . None of your Chantrey Bequest business . Three pictures and one piece of sculpture are to be bought each year in London . Fixed price £ 400 each , large or small . Trustees are to be business men — bank directors . But they can n't choose the works . The works are to be chosen by the students at South Kensington and the Academy Schools . Works by R. A .' s and A. R. A . ' s are absolutely barred . Works by students themselves absolutely barred , too . Cute that , eh ? That 's the arrangement for England . Similar arrangement for France , Italy , and Germany . He gives the thing a start by making it a present of his own collection — stored somewhere in Paris . I do n't mean his own paintings — he bars those . Unusually modest , eh ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HONORIA</speaker>
      <p>How perfectly splendid ! We shall have a real live gallery at last . Surely Anselm , after that —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOOE</speaker>
      <p>Quite beside the point . I shall certainly oppose .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PETER</speaker>
      <p>Oppose what ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOOE</speaker>
      <p>The burial in the Abbey . I shall advise Lady Leonard Alcar —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PETER</speaker>
      <p>No use , Father . Take my word . The governor 's made up his mind . He 's been fearfully keen on art lately . I do n't know why . We were in front of everybody else with the news of Ilam Carve 's death , and the governor 's making a regular pet of him . He says it 's quite time we buried an artist in Westminster Abbey , and he 's given instructions to the whole team . Did n't you see the Mercury this morning ? Anybody who opposes a national funeral for Ilam Carve will be up against the governor . Of course , I tell you that as a friend — confidentially .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Shaken .</stage>Well , I shall see what Lady Leonard says .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Rising in an angry , scornful outburst .</stage>You 'd bury him in Westminster Abbey because he 's a philanthropist , not because he 's an artist . That 's England all over .... Well , I 'm hanged if I 'll have it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOOE</speaker>
      <p>But , my dear sir ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>And I tell you another thing — he 's not dead .</p>

      <p>Not dead — what next ?</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>PETER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Aside to LOOE .</stage>Is he mad , Father ? Nothing but a clerk after all . And yet he takes a private room at the Grand Babylon , and then he refuses a hundred and fifty of the best and goes on like this . And now , blessed if he is n't Ilam Carve !<stage>Laughs .</stage></p>

      <speaker>TIME</speaker>
      <p>— Afternoon , four days later . JANET is dozing in an easy-chair . Enter CARVE in his dressing-gown .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Starting up .</stage>Mr. Shawn , what are you doing out of bed ? After such a dose of flu as you 've had !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I 'm doing nothing out of bed .<stage>Twiddles his thumbs .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>But you 've no right to be out of bed at all .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I was afraid I had n't . But I called and called , and there was no answer . So then I began to argue the point . Why not get up ? I 'd had a tremendous long sleep . I felt singularly powerful . And I thought you 'd gone home .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Nay — that you never did !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I did , honestly .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Do you mean to say you thought for a single moment I should go home and leave you like that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Yes . But of course I thought you might be coming back sooner or later .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Well I never !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>You 've scarcely left me for three days and three nights , Mrs . Cannot , so far as I remember . Surely it was natural for me to suppose that you 'd gone home to your own affairs .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Sarcastically .</stage>It did n't occur to you I might have dropped off to sleep ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Now , do n't be angry . I 'm only convalescent .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Will you kindly march right back to bed this instant ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>No , I 'm dashed if I do !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>I beg pardon .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I say , I 'm dashed if I do ! I wo n't stir until I 've thanked you . I 've been ill I do n't know how many times ; but this is the first time in my life I 've ever enjoyed being ill. D'you know<stage>with an ingenuous smile .</stage>I 'd really no idea what nursing was .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Drily .</stage>Had n't you ? Well , if you call that nursing , I do n't . But it was the best I could do in this barracks , with the kitchen a mile and a half off , and a pack of men that can n't understand English gaping at you all day in evening-dress . I dare say this is a very good hotel for reading newspapers in . But if you want anything that is n't on the menu , it 's as bad as drawing money out of the post office savings bank . You should see me nurse in my own house .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I should like to . Even in this barracks<stage>imitating her .</stage>you 've quite altered my views of life .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Yes , and they wanted altering . When I think of you and that other poor fellow wandering about all alone on that Continent — without the slightest notion of what comfort is .... Well , I 'll say this — it 's a pleasure to nurse you . Now , will you go back to bed ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I suppose coffee 's on the menu ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Coffee ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I think I should like some café au lait , and a roll .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Rising .</stage>You can have hot milk if you like .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>All right . And then when I 've had it I 'll go to bed .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>At telephone .</stage>Are you there ?</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>I should think so indeed ! They sent it up the second day .<stage>Into telephone .</stage>Hot milk , please , and let it be hot !<stage>Hanging up telephone . To CARVE .</stage>I expect they were afraid for their money .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>And you paid it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>I took the money out of your pockets and I just paid it . I never said a word . But if you had n't been ill I should have said something . Of all the swindles , of all the barefaced swindles !... Do you see what it 's costing you to live here — a day ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Oh , not much above four pounds , I hope .</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Speechless at first .</stage>Any woman that knew her business could keep you for a month — a month — for less than you spend here in a day — and better . And better ! Look here : “ Biscuits , 1s . 6d .! ”</p>

      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Well ?</p>

      <p>Well<stage>confidentially earnest .</stage>, will you believe me when I tell you there was n't a pennyworth of biscuits on that plate ? Do you think I do n't know what biscuits are a pound ?</p>

      <p>I know .</p>

      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>You told me Cyrus Carve had insisted on cremation .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>With vivacity .</stage>And what did you expect me to tell you ? I had to soothe you somehow ; you were just about delirious . I was afraid if I told you the truth you 'd be doing something silly — seeing the state you were in . Then it struck me a nice plain cremation at Woking was the very thing to keep you quiet .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Still more moved .</stage>Then he 's .... Westminster Abbey !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Yes , I should say all is over by this time . There were thousands of people for the lying-in-state , it seems .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>But it 's awful . Absolutely awful .</p>

      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Why is it awful ?</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I told you — I explained the whole thing to you .</p>

      <p>I must see her .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Oh , very well .<stage>Exit WAITER .</stage>She 's telephoned each day to inquire how you were . She asked if you wanted a seat for the funeral . I told her you could n't possibly go , but I was sure you 'd like to be invited — whether it was the Abbey or not . Please do n't forget your milk .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Enter HONORIA LOOE in mourning , introduced by WAITER .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HONORIA</speaker>
      <p><stage>Coming in quickly , bowing to JANET and shaking hands with CARVE .</stage>Good afternoon . Please do n't rise . I 've heard how ill you 've been . I 've only called because I simply had to .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>It 's very kind of you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HONORIA</speaker>
      <p>Oh , Mr. Shawn , I know you did n't want him to be buried in the Abbey . I 'm all for quiet funerals , too ; but really this was an exceptional case , and I think if you 'd seen it you 'd have been glad they did decide on the Abbey . Oh , you 've no idea how impressive it was ! The Abbey is always so fine , is n't it ? And it was crammed . You never saw such a multitude of distinguished people . I mean really distinguished — all in black , except , of course , the uniforms . Royalties , ambassadors , representatives from all the academies all over Europe . Rodin was there !! The whole of artistic London came . I do n't mean only painters , but poets , novelists , sculptors , and musicians . The art students had a corner to themselves . And you should have seen the crowds outside . All traffic was stopped up as far as Trafalgar Square . I 've had some difficulty in getting here . The sun was shining through the stained glass . And the music was magnificent . And then when the coffin was carried down the nave — well , there was only one wreath on the pall — just one — a white crown . All the other wreaths were piled near the screen — scores and scores of them — the effect was tremendous . I nearly cried . A lot of people did cry .<stage>Genuinely moved .</stage>There was that great genius lying there . He 'd never done anything except put paint on canvas , and yet — and yet .... Well , it made you feel somehow that England does care for art after all .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>After a pause .</stage>And whom have we to thank for this beautiful national manifestation of sympathy with art ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HONORIA</speaker>
      <p>How do you mean ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>With an attempt at cold irony , but yet in a voice imperfectly controlled .</stage>Did your brother relent and graciously permit Lady Leonard Alcar to encourage a national funeral ? Or was it due solely to the influence of the newspapers written by people of refined culture like the man who gave his opinion the other day that I had got ‘ em ? Or perhaps you yourself settled it with your esteemed uncle over a cup of tea ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HONORIA</speaker>
      <p>Of course , Mr. Shawn , any one can see that you 're artistic yourself , and artists are generally very sarcastic about the British public . I know I am .... Now , do n't you paint ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Shrugging his shoulders .</stage>I used to — a little .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HONORIA</speaker>
      <p>I was sure of it . Well , you can be as sarcastic as you like , but do you know what I was thinking during the service ? I was thinking if only he could have seen it — if only Ilam Carve could have seen it — instead of lying cold in that coffin under that wreath , he 'd —<stage>Hesitating .</stage></p>

      <p>Naturally . Why ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Will you give him a message from me . He 'll do perhaps better than anybody .</p>

      <p>But are we cousins ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Yes . I 've got my reputation to think about . I do n't want to coddle it , but there 's no harm in just keeping an eye on it .</p>
     </sp>

      <p>All what ?</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Stopping-him .</stage>Not so fast !<stage>Pause . She continues reflectively .</stage>Do you know what struck me while her ladyship was telling you about all the grand doings at the funeral — What good has it ever done him to be celebrated and make a big splash in the world ? Was he any happier for it ? From all I can hear he was always trying to hide just as if the police were after him . He never had the slightest notion of comfort , and so you need n't tell me ! And there 's another thing — you need n't tell me he was n't always worrying about some girl or other , because I know he was . A bachelor at his age never thinks about anything else — morning , noon , and night . It stands to reason — and they can say what they like — I know . And now he 's dead — probably because he 'd no notion of looking after himself , and it 's been in all the papers how wonderful he was , and florists ’ girls have very likely sat up half the night making wreaths , and Westminster Abbey was crowded out with fashionable folk — and do you know what all those fashionable folk are thinking about just now — tea ! And if it is n't tea , it 's whisky and soda .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>But you must n't forget that he was really very successful indeed .... Just look at the money he made , for instance .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Well , if sovereigns had been any use to him he 'd never have left two hundred thousand of them behind him — him with no family . No , he was no better than a fool with money . Could n't even spend it .</p>

      <p>Painting .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Casually .</stage>Oh ! and could n't he have had that without running about all over Europe ? He might just as well have been a commercial traveller . Take my word for it , Mr. Shawn , there 's nothing like a comfortable home and a quiet life — and the less you 're in the newspapers the better .</p>

      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>And you now ! As we 're on the subject — before we go any further — you 're a bachelor of forty-five , same as him . What have you been doing with yourself lately ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Doing with myself ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Well , I think I ought to ask because when I was stealing<stage>with a little nervous laugh</stage>the money out of your pocket to pay that hotel bill , I came across a lady 's photograph . I could n't help coming across it . Seeing how things are , I think I ought to ask .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Oh , that ! It must be a photograph of the lady he was engaged to . He broke it off , you know . That was why we came to London in such a hurry .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Then it is true — what the newspaper reporter said ?<stage>CARVE nods .</stage>One of the aristocracy —<stage>CARVE nods .</stage>Who was she ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Lady Alice Rowfant .</p>
     </sp>

      <p>What was it doing in your pocket ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I do n't know . Everything got mixed up . Clothes , papers , everything .</p>

      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Sure ?</p>
     </sp>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Well , a couple of days without me 'll do you no harm . It 's a mistake to be in a hurry when you 've got all your life in front of you .</p>
     </sp>

     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>But I will call you Jane . Jane , why do you ask me if I 'm sure I 'm happy ? When a man has first-class food and first-class love , together with a genuine French bed , really waterproof boots , a constant supply of hot water in the bathroom , enough money to buy cigarettes and sixpenny editions , the freedom to do what he likes all day and every day — and — let me see , what else — a complete absence of domestic servants — then either that man is happy or he is a silly cuckoo !</p>

      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Very easy to say that . But how can you prove it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Well , it does just happen that the proof is behind the sideboard .</p>

      <p>A present ?</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>No , no . You can n't take a picture like snuff ! Get away from it .<stage>He jumps up , snatches the picture from her , and exposes it on a chair at the other side of the room .</stage>Now !<stage>He sits down again .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Yes , it does n't look quite so queer like that . Those are my cooking sleeves , and that seems a bit like my kitchen — that 's my best copper pan ! Is the young woman meant to be me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Well , not to beat about the bush , yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>I do n't consider it very flattering .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>How many times have you told me you hate flattery ?</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>It is pretty good . In fact it 's devilish good . It 's one of the best things I ever did in my life . Old Carve would have got eight hundred for that like a shot .</p>

      <p>Yes , they 've begun it at last .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Well , if you ask me , I should have thought he could have found something better to do with his money .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>As for example ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Well , I should have thought there were more than enough picture galleries as it is . Who wants ‘ em ? Even when they 're free , people wo n't go into them unless it 's a wet day . I 've never been in a free picture gallery yet that was n't as empty as a church . Stands to reason ! It is n't even a cinematograph . When I see rows of people in Trafalgar Square waiting to get into the National Gallery , then I shall begin to think it 's about time we had some more galleries . If I 'd been Ilam Carve ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Well , what should you have done , witch ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>I should have left a bit more to you , for one thing .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I do n't want more . If he 'd left me eight hundred a year instead of eighty , I should n't be any happier . That 's just what I 've learnt since I took lodgings in your delightful wigwam , Jane — money and fame have no connection whatever with happiness .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Money has , when you have n't got enough .</p>

      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>But I have . You wo n't hear of me paying more than half the household expenses , and you say they 're never more than thirty shillings a week . Half thirty — fifteen . Look at the balance it leaves me .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Personally , I am quite satisfied with a plain but perfect table .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>You need n't tell me what you are satisfied with . You 're satisfied with the very best at one shilling and sixpence a pound .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I can place eighty pounds per annum at your absolute disposal . That alone will pay for over a thousand best cuts .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Yes , and what about your clothes and my clothes , and the rates and taxes , and bus-fares , and holidays , and your cigarettes , and doctor , and errand boys ’ Christmas-boxes , and gas , and coal , and repairs ? Repairs ! A hundred and eighty is more like what we want .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>And yet you have several times taken your Bible oath that my half-share of it all came to less than forty pounds .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Well — er — I was thinking of food .<stage>She begins to collect the breakfast things .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Jane , you have been a deceitful thing . But never mind . I will draw a veil over this sinful past . Let us assume that beer goes all to pieces , and that you never get another cent out of Cohoon 's . Well , as you need a hundred and eighty a year , I will give you a hundred and eighty a year .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>And where shall you get the extra hundred ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I shall earn it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>No , you do n't . I wo n't have you taking any more situations .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I shall earn it here .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>How ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Painting !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Stopping her work and coming towards him , half-caressing and half-chiding .</stage>I do n't mind this painting business . Do n't think I object to it in the least . There 's a strong smell with it now and then , but it does keep you quiet in the attic while I 'm cleaning the house , and that 's something . And then going out making sketches you get exercise and fresh air . Being with Ilam Carve so long , I expect you picked up the habit as it were , and I 'm sure I do n't want you to drop it . I love to see you enjoying yourself . But you do n't suppose people 'll buy these things<stage>pointing vaguely to picture on chair</stage>, do you ? No ; there 's far too many amateur artists about for that !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>If I wanted , I could take a cab and sell that in Bond Street inside sixty minutes at my own price . Only I do n't want .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Now , just listen to me . You remember that picture you did of Putney Bridge with the saloon entrance of the Reindeer Public House showing in the corner ? It was one of the first you did here .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Yes , I was looking for it the other day , and I could n't find it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>I 'm not surprised . Because it 's sold .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Sold ?<stage>Excited .</stage>What in the name of ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Soothing him .</stage>Now — now ! Do you remember you said Ilam Carve would have got £ 1000 for a thing just like that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>So he would . It was absolutely characteristic .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Well , I said to myself , “ He seems mighty sure of himself . Supposing it 's me that 's wrong ? ” So one day I quietly took that picture round to Bostock 's , the second-hand furniture man , you know ,— he was a friend of father 's ,— and I asked him what he 'd give me for it . He would n't take it at any price . Not at any price . Then I asked him if he 'd keep it in his shop and sell it for me on commission . Well , it stuck in Bostock 's shop — in his window and out of his window — for twelve months and more , and then one day the landlord of the Reindeer saw it and he bought it for six shillings , because his public-house was in it . He was half-drunk . Mr. Bostock charged me eighteenpence commission , and I bought you two neckties with the four and six , and I said nothing because I did n't want your feelings to be hurt . And that reminds me , last week but one they took the landlord of the Reindeer off to the lunatic asylum .... So , you see !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Serious , preoccupied .</stage>And where 's the picture now ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>I should n't be surprised if it 's in the private bar of the</l>
       <l>Reindeer .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I must get hold of it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Albert , you are n't vexed , are you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Forcing himself to adopt a light tone .</stage>How could I be vexed with two neckties to the good ? But do n't do it again , Jane . I shall go round to the Reindeer this morning and have a drink . If that picture ever found its way to a Bond Street expert 's , the consequences might be awkward — devilish awkward . Because it 's dated , you see .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>No , I do n't see . I should n't have said a word about it , only I wanted to save you from being disappointed later on .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>In a new casual tone .</stage>Just get me my cash-box , will you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>JANET at once produces the cash-box from a drawer .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>And what now ? I 'm not broke yet , you great silly .<stage>Laughs , but is rather intimidated by CARVE 'S air .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Having unlocked box and taken a bag from it .</stage>You see that ?<stage>He showers gold out of it .</stage>Well , count it !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Gracious ! Ten — fifteen — eighteen — twenty ?— two — four — twenty-six pounds . These your savings ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>That 's what I 've earned with painting , just at odd times .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Really ?<stage>CARVE nods .</stage>You could knock me down with a feather !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I 'll tell you . You know the framemaker 's next to Salmon and Gluckstein 's . I buy my colours and canvases and things there . They cost money . I owed the chap two pounds once , and one morning , in the shop , when I was opening my box to put some new tubes in , he saw one of my pictures all wet . He offered of his own accord to take it for what I owed him . I would n't let him have it . But I was rather hard up , so I said I 'd do him another instead , and I did him one in a different style and not half as good , and of course he liked it even better . Since then , I 've done him quite a few . It is n't that I 've needed the money ; but it 's a margin , and colours and frames , etc . come to a dickens of a lot in a year .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Staggered .</stage>And whatever does he do with them ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>With the pictures ? Do n't know . I 've never seen one in his window . I have n't been selling him any lately .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Why ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Oh , I did n't feel like it . And the things were getting too good . But , of course , I can start again any time .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Still staggered .</stage>Two pounds a piece ?<stage>CARVE nods .</stage>Would he give you two pounds for that ?<stage>Pointing to portrait .</stage></p>

      <p>You bet he would .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Why ! Two pounds would keep us for the best part of a week . How long does it take you to do one ?</p>

      <p>I 've been buying some very delightful little things of yours from a man that calls himself a picture-dealer and frame-maker<stage>ironically</stage>in the High Street here . I persuaded him — not without difficulty — to give me your address . And I 've ventured to call just to see if by chance you have anything for sale .</p>

      <speaker>EBAG</speaker>
      <p><stage>After lighting-cigarette .</stage>I did . I knew from the very first picture I bought from our friend the “ picture-dealer and frame-maker ” in the early part of last year .</p>

     <sp>

      <p><stage>Shaking his head .</stage>My dear sir , there was once a well-known man who stood six feet ten inches high . He shaved off his beard and dyed his hair , and invented a very ingenious costume , and went to a Fancy Dress Ball as Tom Thumb . Strange to say , his disguise was penetrated immediately .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Who are you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EBAG</speaker>
      <p>My name is Ebag — New Bond Street .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>What ! You 're my old dealer !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EBAG</speaker>
      <p>And I 'm delighted at last to make your acquaintance , sir . It was n't until I 'd bought several of those small canvases from the Putney man that I began to inquire closely into their origin . As a general rule it 's a mistake for a dealer to be too curious . But my curiosity got the better of me . And when I found out that the pictures were being produced week by week , fresh , then I knew I was on the edge of some mystery .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Awkwardly .</stage>The fact is , perhaps , I ought to explain .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EBAG</speaker>
      <p>Pardon me . I ask nothing . It is n't my affair . I felt certain , solely from the evidence of what I was buying , that the great painter who was supposed to be buried in Westminster Abbey , and whose somewhat premature funeral I attended , must be alive and painting vigorously . I wanted the assurance from your lips . I have it . The rest does not concern me — at any rate , for the moment .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I 'll say this — you know a picture when you see it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EBAG</speaker>
      <p><stage>Proudly .</stage>I am an expert , nothing else .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>All right ! Well , I 'll only ask you to persevere in your discretion . As you say , it is n't your affair . Thank goodness , I did n't put a date on any of these things . I wo n't sell any more . I 'd take an oath never to paint again , only I know I should go and break it next week . I shall rely on this famous discretion of yours to say nothing — nothing whatever .</p>

      <p>I 'm afraid it 's too late .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>How too late ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EBAG</speaker>
      <p>I 'm afraid I shall have to ask you to state publicly that you are Ilam Carve , and that there must have been — er — some misapprehension , somewhere , over that funeral .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Aghast .</stage>Publicly ? Why ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EBAG</speaker>
      <p>It 's like this , I 've been selling those pictures to Texel in New York . You remember , he 's always been one of your principal collectors . He 's getting old , and he 's half-blind , but he still buys . Now , I rely on my judgment , and I guaranteed those pictures to be genuine Carves . Well , somebody over there must have had suspicions .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>What does that matter ? There is n't a date on any of them .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EBAG</speaker>
      <p>Just so . But in one of those pictures there 's most distinctly a taxi-cab . It is n't a private motor car . It 's a taxi .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>And if there is ? No law against painting a taxi , I hope !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EBAG</speaker>
      <p><stage>Again quietly dramatic .</stage>No . But at the date of your funeral there was n't a single taxi on the streets of London .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>The devil !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EBAG</speaker>
      <p>Exactly . Texel is bringing an action against me for misrepresentation . I shall have to ask you to give evidence and say who you are .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Angrily .</stage>But I wo n't give evidence ! You 've brought this on yourself . How much did you sell those little pictures for ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EBAG</speaker>
      <p>Oh , an average of between four and five hundred .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>And what did you pay for them ? I ask you , what did you pay for them ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EBAG</speaker>
      <p><stage>Smoothly .</stage>Four pounds a piece . The fact is — I did rather well out of them .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Damned Jew !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EBAG</speaker>
      <p><stage>Smoothly .</stage>Damned — possibly . Jew — most decidedly . But in this particular instance I behaved just like a Christian . I paid a little less than I was asked , and sold for the highest I could get . I am perfectly innocent , and my reputation is at stake .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I do n't care .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EBAG</speaker>
      <p>But I do . It 's the reputation of the greatest expert in Europe . And I shall have to insist on you going into the witness-box .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Horrified .</stage>Me in the witness-box ! Me cross-examined ! No . That 's always been my nightmare !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EBAG</speaker>
      <p>Nevertheless —</p>

      <p>Please go .<stage>Commandingly .</stage>Please go .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>And it all comes of this painting . Art as it 's called .<stage>She finds her apron and puts it on .</stage></p>

      <p>Anybody would say you did n't care a cent whether I 'm Ilam Carve or whether I 'm somebody else .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>What does it matter to me who you are , so long as you 're you ? Men are so unpractical . You can be the Shah of Persia if you like — I do n't mind .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>I did n't . I agreed with everything you said .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>You said I did n't really believe after all that you are Ilam Carve , and I assured you in the most soothing manner that I did believe you are Ilam Carve !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>And do you call that agreeing with me ? I know perfectly well from your tone that in spite of all my explanations and reiterations during the last three months you do n't believe I 'm Ilam Carve . You only say you do in order to soothe me . I hate being soothed . You 're as convinced as ever that Ebag is a rascal , and that I 've got a bee in my bonnet .</p>

      <p>I hope you never will . One of the chief charms of existence in your wigwam , my child , is that I never hear any confounded chatter about art . Now — are we pals ?</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>Now do listen , darling . Let 's go away . We can n't stop here . This Ebag case is getting more and more on your nerves , and on mine too . I 'm sure that 's what 's the matter with us . What it 'll be next week when the trial comes on , I do n't know — upon my soul I do n't . It 's all very well for you to refuse to see callers and never go out . But I can tell you one thing — we shall have those newspaper people on the roof in a day or two , and looking down the chimney to see how I lay the fire . Lawyers are nothing to them . Do you know — no you do n't , because I did n't want you to be upset — last night 's milk was brought by a journalist — with a camera . They 're beginning to bribe the tradesmen . I tremble to think what will be in this morning 's papers .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Trying to make light of it .</stage>Oh , nothing will upset me now . But you might let me know at once if the editor of the Spectator calls round with the bread .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>And I 'll tell you another thing . That Mr. Horning — you know the breathless man on the Evening Courier that came to the Grand Babylon — he 's taken lodgings opposite — arrived last night .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Oh , for a machine gun — one simple little machine gun !<stage>Exit JANET , L .</stage>She immediately returns with a tray containing bread , etc ., and a toasting-fork .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>So I thought if we just vanished —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>It 's too late — I 've had the subpoena . If I hooked it , everybody would say I was an adventurer .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>We could come back for the trial .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>We should be followed .</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Not if we start now .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Creep away in the dark ! No ! I 'll go through with the thing .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Well , I shall travel alone , then . Here 's my bunch of keys . I 'll just explain to you where everything is . I daresay Mrs. Simpson will come in and clean up . She 's not bad , as charwomen go .</p>

      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>No , it is n't . We took the bell off three days ago .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>I was told that it was impossible to effect an entrance in the ordinary way . Hence , we had to use craft . I argued that food must come into the house , and that it probably came in early .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Well , it 's a good thing for you I happened to hear the cat mewing , or you might have had another couple of hours in my back yard . You 're the eldest , I suppose .</p>
     </sp>

      <p>Now , mother , please do n't cry .</p>

      <p>Now , mother — you are sure you recognise this gentleman ?</p>

      <p><stage>Not very positively .</stage>Yes — yes . It 's a rare long while ....</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>He is your husband and our father ?</p>

      <speaker>MRS. S</speaker>
      <p><stage>More positively .</stage>Yes . And sorry I am to say it .<stage>JANET eyes her carefully .</stage></p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>I think that suffices .<stage>To JANET .</stage>Madam , you are in a most unfortunate position . You supposed yourself to be a married woman , whereas you are nothing of the kind . I need n't say that as the victim of a heartless bigamist you have our deepest ....</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>And so these are my two sons ! They show little emotion in beholding the author of their being for the first time . As for me , I hardly recognise them .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. S</speaker>
      <p>And is it likely , seeing they were born six months after you deserted me , Albert ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I see . If it is n't indiscreet , am I a grandfather ?</p>

      <p>I only wanted to know the worst . Silly joke about the fertility of curates — you 've met with it , no doubt !</p>

      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>Your tone is simply lamentable , sir .</p>

      <p><stage>To JAMES .</stage>Mind ! You can do the other side . Now , take care ; the fire 's very hot .<stage>In the same mild tone to MRS. SHAWN .</stage>Twenty-six years , you say ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. S</speaker>
      <p>Yes . Albert was twenty-two then , were n't you , Albert ?</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Undoubtedly .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>And how did you come to find us out at last ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. S</speaker>
      <p>It was through an advertisement put in the paper by that Mr. Texel — him that 's in this law case — offering a reward for information about a Mr. Albert Shawn who 'd been valet to that artist man that died .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Oh ! So Mr. Texel has been advertising , has he ?<stage>Giving a cup of tea to JOHN SHAWN .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS. S</speaker>
      <p>Yes , for anybody that knew Albert Shawn when he was young . “ Albert Shawn , ” I says , “ that 's my husband 's name . ” I 'd been told he 'd gone off in service with a painter or something of that kind . I married him as a valet .</p>

      <p>Yes , they would go into the church , both of them ! I do n't know how we 've managed it , but managed it we have , surplices and all . And very happy they were , I 'm sure .

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>There 's a police-station in the Upper Richmond Road . Better call there . It 'll be so nice for you two , when you 're flourishing about in the pulpit , to think of your father in prison — wo n't it now ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>We , of course , should not prosecute . If you are prepared to go on living with this gentleman as though nothing had happened —</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>What ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>All that rigmarole about you being Ilam Carve ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>You 're beginning to come round at last ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Well , I think they were quite honest people — those three . There 's no doubt the poor creature once had a husband who did run off . And it seems fairly clear his name was Albert Shawn , and he went away as valet to an artist . But then , on the other hand , if there is one thing certain in this world , it is that you were never married before you married me . That I will swear to .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>And yet she identified me . She was positive .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Positive ? That 's just what she was n't ! And did n't you notice the queer way she looked at you as they went out ? As much as to say , “ I wonder now whether it is him — after all ? ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Then you really think she could be mistaken on such a point ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Pooh ! After twenty-six years . Besides , all men of forty-seven look more or less alike .... And so I 'm the wife of Ilam Carve that 's supposed to be buried in Westminster Abbey and royalty went to his funeral ! We 'll have some tea ourselves . I say , why did you do it ?<stage>Pours out tea .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Casually .</stage>I do n't know . It was to save worry to begin with , and then it went on by itself and somehow I could n't stop it .... I do n't know !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Endearingly .</stage>Well , I 've always told you frankly you 've got a bee in your bonnet .<stage>Drinking tea and turning over the post .</stage>More letters from these newspaper people ! What 's this lovely crest on this envelope ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>It 's from Lord Leonard Alcar . He says if we 'll go up and see him to-morrow afternoon he 'll be very much obliged indeed , and he may be able to be of assistance to us .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Deeply impressed .</stage>Lord Leonard Al ... Where 's the letter ?<stage>Searches for it hurriedly . As she reads it .</stage>Well I never !<stage>Reading</stage>“ And Mrs. Shawn . ” I 've got nothing to go in .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>TEXEL</speaker>
      <p>Certainly . Among kindred spirits .</p>

      <p>Assuredly , my lord .</p>

      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p>I would merely request you to control so far as possible any expression of your astonishment at meeting one another here . That is to say , any violent expression .</p>

      <p>I suppose what you really want is to stop this funny trial from coming on .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p><stage>Slightly taken aback .</stage>Mrs. X , I congratulate myself on your presence here . Yes , my ambition is to be peacemaker . Of course a peacemaker always runs the risk of a broken head , but I shall entrust my head to your good nature . As a proof that I really mean business , I need only point out that I have n't invited a single lawyer .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EBAG</speaker>
      <p><stage>After slight pause .</stage>This is exceedingly good of your lordship .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TEXEL</speaker>
      <p>For myself I 'm rather looking forward to next week . I 've spared no expense to get up a first-class show . Half the papers in New York and Chicago are sending over special correspondents . I 've even secured your champion humorous judge ; and altogether I reckon this trial will be about the greatest judicial proposition the British public 's seen in years . Still , I 'm always ready to oblige — and I 'll shake hands right now , on terms — my terms .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p>We are making progress .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TEXEL</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>But what I do n't understand is — where you come in , Lord</l>
       <l>Leonard .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p>Where I come in ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TEXEL</speaker>
      <p>Well , I do n't want to be personal , but is this Hague Conference merely your hobby , or are you standing in with somebody ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p>I quite appreciate your delicacy . Let me assure you that , though it gives me the greatest pleasure to see you all , I have not selected you as the victims of a hobby . Nor have I anything whatever to gain by stopping the trial . The reverse . At the trial I should probably have a seat on the bench next to a delightful actress , and I should enjoy the case very much indeed . I have no doubt that even now the learned judge is strenuously preparing his inimitable flashes of humour , and that , like the rest of the world , I should allow myself to be convulsed by them . I like to think of four K. C . ' s toiling hard for a miserable hundred guineas a day each . I like to think of the solicitors , good , honest fellows , striving their best to keep the costs as low as possible . I even like to think of the jury with their powerful intellects who , when we are dead and gone , Mr. Texel , will tell their grandchildren proudly how they decided the famous case of Texel v. Ebag . Above all , I like to think of the witnesses revelling in their cross-examination . Nobody will be more sorry than I to miss this grand spectacle of the greatest possible number of the greatest possible brains employed for the greatest possible length of time in settling a question that an average grocer 's assistant could settle in five minutes . I am human . But , I have been approached — I have been flattered by the suggestion — that I might persuade you two gentlemen to abandon the trial , and I may whisper to you that the abandonment of the trial would afford satisfaction in — er — influential quarters .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TEXEL</speaker>
      <p>Then are we up against the British Government ? Well , go ahead .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p><stage>Protesting with a very courteous air of extreme astonishment .</stage>My dear Mr. Texel , how can I have been so clumsy as to convey such an idea ? The Government ? Not in the least — not in the least . On behalf of nobody whatever .<stage>Confidentially .</stage>I am merely in a position to inform you positively that an amicable settlement of the case would be viewed with satisfaction in influential quarters .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Well , I can tell you it would be viewed with satisfaction in a certain street in Putney . But influential quarters — what 's it got to do with them ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p>I shall be quite frank with you . The dignity of Westminster Abbey is involved in this case , and nothing in all England is more sacred to us than Westminster Abbey . One has only to pronounce the word “ the Abbey ” — to realize that . We know what a modern trial is ; we know what the modern press is ; and , unhappily , we know what the modern bench is . It is impossible to contemplate with equanimity the prospect of Westminster Abbey and its solemnities being given up to the tender mercy of the evening papers and a joking judge surrounded by millinery . Such an exhibition would be unseemly . It would soil our national existence . In a word , it would have a bad effect .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p>Undoubtedly . But this is England . It is perhaps a disadvantage that we are not in Russia nor in Prussia . But we must make the best of our miserable country .<stage>In a new tone , showing the orator skilled in changes of voice .</stage>Ca n't we discuss our little affair in a friendly way entirely without prejudice ? We are together here , among gentlemen —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>I 'm afraid you 're forgetting me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p><stage>Recovering himself .</stage>Madam , I am convinced that none of us can be more gentlemanly than yourself .... Can we not find a way of settlement ?<stage>With luxurious enjoyment of the idea .</stage>Imagine the fury of all those lawyers and journalists when they learn that we — er — if I may so express it — have done them in the eye !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TEXEL</speaker>
      <p>If I was n't going to come out on top , I could understand you worrying about your old Abbey . But I 'm taking the part of your Abbey . When I win it wins , and I 'm certain to win .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p>I do not doubt ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EBAG</speaker>
      <p><stage>With suave assurance .</stage>But I do .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p><stage>Continuing .</stage>I do not doubt your conviction , Mr. Texel . It merely proves that you have never seen a British Jury exercising itself upon a question relating to the fine arts . If you had you would not be certain , for you would know that twelve tradesmen so occupied are capable of accomplishing the most incredible marvels . Supposing you do n't win — supposing Mr. Ebag wins ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EBAG</speaker>
      <p>As I assuredly shall .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p>Then we should have the whole world saying , “ Well , they have n't given a national funeral to a really great artist for about a century , and when at last they do try they only succeed in burying a valet . ”</p>

      <p>The effect would be lamentable — utterly lamentable . You will realize that in influential quarters ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TEXEL</speaker>
      <p>But do you reckon this policy of hushing up things ever does any good ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p>My dear sir , it is the corner-stone of England 's greatness . It is the policy that has made her what she is !</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Looking round again .</stage>True ! What she is !</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p><stage>Turning sharply to CARVE behind him .</stage>Mr. X , your interest in my picture flatters me immensely ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Interrupting him .</stage>I see you 've bought my latest portrait of my wife .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p>Yes .</p>
     </sp>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I suppose it would be abusing your hospitality to inquire how much you paid our excellent dealer for it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p>Not in the least . But the fact is we have n't yet settled the price . The exact price is to depend on the result of our gathering .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Well , if anybody had told me I should find my own portrait — cooking-sleeves and all ——</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Inarticulate — she returns to her chair .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p>And now that we have got so far , Mr. X , I should like to centralize the attention of this quite friendly gathering on yourself .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Approaching airily .</stage>Really !<stage>He sits .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p>There are several questions we might discuss . For example , we might argue the artistic value of the pictures admittedly the work of Mr. X . That would probably occupy us for about ten years . Or we might ask ourselves how it happened that that exceedingly astute dealer , Mr. Ebag , came to sell as a genuine Ilam Carve , without offering any explanation , a picture which , on the face of it , was painted some time after that great painter had received a national funeral in Westminster Abbey .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EBAG</speaker>
      <p>Sheer carelessness , my lord .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p>Or we might ask ourselves why a valet should try to pass himself off as a world-renowned artist . Or , on the other hand , why a world-renowned artist should pass himself off as a valet .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Sheer carelessness , my lord .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p>But these details of psychology are beside the main point . And the main point is<stage>to CARVE</stage>— Are you Ilam Carve or are you Albert Shawn ?<stage>To the others .</stage>Surely with a little goodwill and unembarrassed by the assistance of experts , lawyers , and wigs generally , we can settle that ! And once it is settled the need for a trial ceases .<stage>CARVE assumes an elaborately uninterested air .</stage>The main point does not seem to interest you , Mr. X .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Seeming to start .</stage>I beg your pardon . No , not profoundly . Why should it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p>Yet you claim ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Excuse me . I claim nothing except to be let alone . Certainly I do not ask to be accepted as Ilam Carve . I was leading a placid and agreeable existence in a place called Putney , an ideal existence with a pearl among women , when my tranquillity was disturbed and my life transformed into a perfect nightmare by a quarrel between a retail trades-man<stage>indicating EBAG</stage>and a wholesale ink-dealer<stage>indicating TEXEL</stage>about one of my pictures . It does not concern me . My role is and will be passive . If I am forced into the witness-box I shall answer questions to the worst of my ability , and I shall do no more . I am not cross . I am not sulking ; but I consider that I have a grievance . If I am here , it is solely because my wife does what she likes with me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TEXEL</speaker>
      <p>Bravo ! This is as good as the trial .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p><stage>Good-humouredly .</stage>Will you answer questions here ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Good-humouredly .</stage>It depends .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p>Do you assert that you are Ilam Carve ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I assert nothing .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p>Are you Ilam Carve ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Yes , but I do n't want to be .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p>Might I inquire why you allowed your servant to be buried in your name ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Well , he always did everything for me — a most useful man .... But I did n't ‘ allow ’ him to be buried in my name . On the contrary , I told various people that I was not dead — but strange to say , nobody would believe me . My handsome , fascinating cousin here would n't even let me begin to tell him . Even my wife would n't believe me , so I gave it up .</p>

      <p>But do you mean ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TEXEL</speaker>
      <p>May I interrupt , Lord Leonard ? I could listen for hours to this absolutely stupendous gentleman . A circus is nothing to it . But are n't we jumping the track ? I 've got two witnesses . Mr. Cyrus Carve will swear that your Mr. X is not his cousin . And the original Mrs. Albert Shawn will swear that he is her husband . That 's my case . How is my esteemed opponent going to answer it ?</p>
     </sp>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TEXEL</speaker>
      <p>Come . You do n't mean to argue that a woman could mistake another man for her own husband — even after twenty-five years or so ?</p>

      <p>I daresay they preach very nicely , but out of the pulpit they do n't what I should call shine , poor boys ! Anybody could see she was n't positive . Why , it was n't until the old lady dropped in to have a cup of tea with us that I felt sure my husband 's name really was Carve .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>

      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EBAG</speaker>
      <p>I should like to say ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p><stage>Interrupting grimly .</stage>Lord Leonard , is n't it time that this ceased ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TEXEL</speaker>
      <p><stage>Heartily amused .</stage>But why ? I 'm enjoying every minute of it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p>I should be sorry to interfere with Mr. Texel 's amusement , but I think the moment has now come for me to make a disclosure . When I was approached as to this affair I consulted Mr. Cyrus Carve first , he being the sole surviving relative of his cousin . That seemed to me to be the natural and proper course to adopt . Mr. Cyrus Carve gave me a very important piece of information , and it is solely on the strength of that information that I have invited you all to come here this afternoon .<stage>He looks at CYRUS .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p><stage>Clearing his throat , to EBAG and CARVE .</stage>Of course , you 'll argue that after thirty-five years absence it 's a wise man that can recognize his own cousin . I 'm absolutely convinced in my own mind that you<stage>scorn-fully to CARVE</stage>are not my cousin . But then , you 'll tell me that men have been hung before now on the strength of sworn identification that proved afterwards to be mistaken . I admit it . I admit that in theory I may be wrong .<stage>With increased grim sarcasm .</stage>I admit that in theory the original Mrs. Shawn may be wrong . Everything 's possible , especially with a bully of a K. C . cross-examining you , and a judge turning you into ‘ copy ’ for Punch . But I 've got something up my sleeve that will settle the whole affair instantly , to the absolute satisfaction of both plaintiff and defendant .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>My dear fellow , why not have told us this exciting news earlier ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p>Why not ?<stage>Glowering at CARVE .</stage>Because I wanted you to commit yourself completely beyond any withdrawing . I decided what sort of man you were the moment I first set eyes on you , and when I heard of this law case , I said to myself that I 'd come forward as a witness , but I should n't give any evidence away in advance . I said to myself I 'd show you up once and for all in full court . However , his lordship prevailed on me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Well ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p>When my cousin and I were boys I 've seen him with his shirt off .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>True . And he 's seen you with yours off .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p>Now just here<stage>pointing to left front neck below collar</stage>, just below his collar , my cousin Ilam Carve had two moles close together — one was hairy and the other was n't . My cousin was very proud of them .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Oh !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p><stage>Staggered but obstinate .</stage>Well , let 's have a look at them .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p><stage>To JANET .</stage>Then doubtless you are familiar with this double phenomenon , Mrs. X ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Yes . But he is n't so proud of his moles now as he used to be when he was a boy .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p>Now , gentlemen , you see how beautifully clear the situation is . By one simple act we shall arrive at a definite and final result , and we shall have avoided all the noise and scandal of a public trial . Mr. X , will you oblige us very much by taking your collar off ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Jumping up .</stage>Please , there 's just one little thing .<stage>To CARVE .</stage>Wait a moment , dear .<stage>To EBAG .</stage>Mr. Ebag , how many of those pictures did you sell to Mr. Texel ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EBAG</speaker>
      <p>Fifteen .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>And you made a profit of over four hundred pounds on each ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TEXEL</speaker>
      <p><stage>Boisterously — laughing to EBAG .</stage>You did ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Fifteen times four hundred — that makes — how much does it make ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TEXEL</speaker>
      <p>Six thousand , madam . Thirty thousand dollars . Great !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>To EBAG .</stage>Do n't you think we deserve some of that , as it were ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EBAG</speaker>
      <p>Madam , I shall be delighted to pay you five thousand four hundred pounds . That will be equivalent to charging you a nominal commission of ten per cent .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Thank you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I wo n't touch a penny of their wretched money .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Sweetly .</stage>I would n't dream of asking you to , dearest . I shall touch it . Goodness knows what street we shall be in after this affair — and with my brewery shares gone simply all to pieces ! Now , dearest , you can take it off .<stage>She resumes her seat .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Lightly .</stage>I 'm hanged if I do !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p>But , my dear Mr. X !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Lightly .</stage>I 'm dashed if I take my collar off .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p><stage>Triumphant .</stage>Ha ! I knew it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Why should I offer my skin to the inspection of two individuals in whom I have n't the slightest interest ? They 've quarrelled about me , but is that a reason why I should undress myself ? Let me say again , I 've no desire whatever to prove that I am Ilam Carve .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p>But surely to oblige us immensely , Mr. X , you will consent to give just one extra performance of an operation which , in fact , you accomplish three hundred and sixty-five times every year without any disastrous results .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>I do n't look at it like that . Already my fellow-citizens , expressing their conviction that I was a great artist , have buried me in Westminster Abbey — not because I was a great artist , but because I left a couple of hundred thousand pounds for a public object . And now my fellow-citizens , here assembled , want me to convince them that I am a great artist by taking my collar off . I wo n't do it . I simply will not do it . It 's too English . If any person wishes to be convinced that I 'm an artist and not a mountebank , let him look at my work<stage>pointing vaguely to a picture</stage>, because that 's all the proof that I mean to offer . If he is blind or shortsighted I regret it , but my neck is n't going to help him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TEXEL</speaker>
      <p>Brilliant ! Then we shall have the trial after all .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>Yes , but your brilliant friend will be on his way to South</l>
       <l>America before then .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Sweetly to CYRUS .</stage>I assure you it 's quite true about those moles . That 's why he wears those collars .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p><stage>Grimly .</stage>No doubt ....<stage>Repeating .</stage>Nevertheless he 'll be on his way to South America .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p><stage>Significantly .</stage>Unless you 're stopped .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>And who 's going to stop me ? All the laws of this country added together can n't make me take my collar off if I do n't want to .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p>What about arresting you for bigamy ? What about Holloway ? I fancy at Holloway they have a short method with people who wo n't take their collars off .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARVE</speaker>
      <p>Well , that will only be another proof that the name of this island is England . It will be telegraphed to the Continent that in order to prove to herself that she possessed a great artist , England had to arrest him for bigamy and shove him into prison .... Characteristic ! Characteristic !</p>

      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Rising to CARVE , winningly .</stage>Now — Ilam . You 're only laying up trouble for yourself , and for me too . Do please think of the trial . You know how shy you are , and how you tremble at the mere thought of a witness-box .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CYRUS</speaker>
      <p>I can believe it .</p>

      <p>I have an idea that I can persuade —</p>

      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p><stage>Hotly .</stage>Excuse me . You can n't .</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>EBAG</speaker>
      <p>I have an idea I can . But<stage>hesitates</stage>the fact is , not in the presence of ladies .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>Oh . If that 's all —<stage>walks away in a huff .</stage></p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>EBAG</speaker>
      <p><stage>To CARVE .</stage>You remember Lady Alice Rowfant ?</p>

      <p><stage>Taken aback .</stage>That does n't concern you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EBAG</speaker>
      <p><stage>Ignoring this answer .</stage>Pardon me if I speak plainly . You were once engaged to marry Lady Alice Rowfant . But a few days before your valet died you changed your mind and left her in the lurch in Spain . Lady Alice Rowfant is now in England . She has been served with a subpoena to give evidence at the trial . And if the trial comes on she will have to identify you and tell her story in court .<stage>Pause .</stage>Are you going to put her to this humiliation ?</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>CARVE walks about . Then he gives a gesture of surrender .</stage>

      <p>No . The mere mention of her name was sufficient .</p>

      <p>That 's even worse !<stage>Rushing across to CARVE and pettishly seizing his necktie . CARVE submits .</stage>Here ! Let me do it — for goodness sake !

      <speaker>ALCAR</speaker>
      <p>Well , if I 'm so fatherly , may I venture on a little advice to you two ?<stage>To CARVE .</stage>You said you did n't want to be Ilam Carve . Do n't be Ilam Carve . Let Ilam Carve continue his theoretical repose in the Abbey and you continue to be somebody else . It will save a vast amount of trouble , and nobody will be a penny the worse . Leave England — unobtrusively . If you feel homesick , arrange to come back during a general election , and you will be absolutely unnoticed . You have money . If you need more , I can dispose of as many new pictures as you like to send .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JANET</speaker>
      <p>I do n't want him to paint any more pictures .</p>
