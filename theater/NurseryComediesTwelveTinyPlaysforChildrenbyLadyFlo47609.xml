   <head>WHAT HAPPENED TO HENNY PENNY .</head>
   <stage>H. P .— Oh dear me ! Oh dear me ! What was it , I wonder ? What could it have been ? I must scream for help . Help ! Help !</stage>
   <stage>Enter COCKIE LOCKIE .</stage>
   <stage>C. L .— What 's the matter ? Henny Penny , what is happening ?</stage>
   <stage>H. P .— Oh dear me ! I do n't know what it was , that is the worst of it .</stage>
   <stage>C. L .— You do n't know what it was ?</stage>
   <stage>H. P .— How should I , when I never saw it ? It fell on to my head .</stage>
   <stage>C. L .— What fell on to your head ? What a stupid hen you are !</stage>
   <stage>H. P .— I was under a beanstack pecking about , and suddenly something fell from the top of the stack on to my head . I thought at first it was a bean or a piece of stick , but now I think of it , I am sure it was something much heavier — a piece of the sky , or something of that sort .</stage>
   <stage>C. L .— A piece of the sky falling out ! But , Henny , this is serious .</stage>
   <stage>H. P .— Of course ! That 's what I feel . That 's why I screamed at once for help .</stage>
   <stage>C. L .— You see , if the sky is coming to bits , I think the Queen of England ought to know it .</stage>
   <stage>H. P .— I think she ought . Let 's go and tell her !</stage>
   <stage>C. L .— Agreed ! We 'll start at once . I 'll just crow first very loud that everybody may know something is happening .</stage>
   <stage>H. P .— Very well , and I 'll cluck .</stage>
   <stage>( They crow and cluck . )</stage>
   <stage>C. L .— Now , then , we can start .</stage>
   <stage>( A voice outside is heard . )</stage>
   <stage>VOICE .— Hullo there ! Cockie Lockie ! Henny Penny !</stage>
   <stage>C. L .— There 's that stupid Ducky Daddles .</stage>
   <stage>Enter DUCKY DADDLES .</stage>
   <stage>C. L .— Well , Ducky Daddles , what do you want ?</stage>
   <stage>D. D .— I just wanted to come and have a chat . I saw you and Henny Penny starting off for a pleasant walk together , and I thought I 'd come too .</stage>
   <stage>C. L .— Ah ! but this is no common walk .</stage>
   <stage>H. P .— Indeed it is not .</stage>
   <stage>D. D .— Why , where are you going to ?</stage>
   <stage>C. L .— We 're going to London to see the Queen .</stage>
   <stage>D. D .— The Queen ! What for ?</stage>
   <stage>H. P .— To tell her a most important piece of news .</stage>
   <stage>C. L .— A great piece of the sky fell out close to Henny Penny 's head , and nearly killed her .</stage>
   <stage>D. D .— Dear me ! That is important . The Queen ought to know it at once . I 'll come with you .</stage>
   <stage>C. L .— You ! Do you think you can walk so far ?</stage>
   <stage>D. D .— Oh , dear , yes ! Besides , I daresay , we shall find some place on the road where we can get slugs or snails , or something of that sort , in case I feel faint .</stage>
   <stage>C. L .— Very well , then , are you ready ? Now we 'll start .</stage>
   <stage>D. D .— Come on , then . I 'll just quack first to let people know where I am .</stage>
   <stage>( Quacks . They prepare to start off arm in arm . A voice outside is heard . )</stage>
   <stage>VOICE .— Hullo ! Cockie Lockie ! Henny Penny ! Ducky Daddles !</stage>
   <stage>C. L .— Now , what is it ? We shall never get off at this rate .</stage>
   <stage>D. D .— It is that silly Goosey Poosey .</stage>
   <stage>Enter GOOSEY POOSEY .</stage>
   <stage>G. P .— There you are , Ducky Daddles ! I 've been looking for you everywhere !</stage>
   <stage>C. L .— What do you want ?</stage>
   <stage>G. P .— I just wanted to see what you were doing , and have a chat . What a horrid day it is ! the roads are so dry there is no walking in them .</stage>
   <stage>D. D .— Well , I am sorry I 've not time to stay with you . I 'm just off to London to see the Queen .</stage>
   <stage>G. P .— You , Ducky Daddles ! Something very strange must have happened to make you go so far .</stage>
   <stage>D. D .— Indeed it has , and what do you think ?</stage>
   <stage>C. L .— Guess what fell on to Henny Penny 's head .</stage>
   <stage>G. P .— An acorn , or perhaps even a chestnut .</stage>
   <stage>D. D .— A chestnut ! Oh , if that were all ! No , my friend . It was a piece of the sky , a great , solid slab of blue sky , that fell clump on to the top of poor Henny Penny 's head , and nearly killed her .</stage>
   <stage>G. P .— Oh , how terrible ! Have you sent for the police ?</stage>
   <stage>C. L .— No , we 're going to London to tell the Queen . We think she ought to know .</stage>
   <stage>G. P .— Indeed she ought , and at once . I 'll come with you to see what she says .</stage>
   <stage>C. L .— Very well ! Only you must not keep waiting to splash about in all the puddles , then .</stage>
   <stage>G. P .— Of course not , when I 'm out walking on business .</stage>
   <stage>C. L .— Very well , then , we 'll start without losing any more time .</stage>
   <stage>G. P .— I 'll just hiss first in case there 's an enemy in the road . ( Hisses . ) Now , then , I 'm ready .</stage>
   <stage>C. L .— Then let us start .</stage>
   <stage>( COCKIE LOCKIE arm in arm with HENNY PENNY . GOOSEY POOSEY arm in arm with DUCKY DADDLES . A voice outside is heard . )</stage>
   <stage>VOICE .— Cockie Lockie ! Henny Penny ! Goosey Poosey ! Ducky Daddles !</stage>
   <stage>C. L .— Dear me ! We shall never get to London .</stage>
   <stage>G. P .— It 's that gobbling Turky Lurky !</stage>
   <stage>Enter TURKY LURKY .</stage>
   <stage>T. L .— Ha ! ha ! my friends . This is very nice . Oho ! Aha ! Where are you all off to so merrily ?</stage>
   <stage>C. L .— Not merrily , indeed ! Our business is most serious .</stage>
   <stage>T. L .— You make my feathers stand on end . What is the matter ?</stage>
   <stage>G. P .— Have n't you heard ? The most terrible thing has happened !</stage>
   <stage>H. P .— One half of the sky fell on me as I was sitting under a haystack , and we do n't know what is going to happen next .</stage>
   <stage>T. L .— Oh dear ! This is terrible ! Suppose the other half were to come down ?</stage>
   <stage>C. L .— Exactly ! That 's what we 're afraid of . We 're going to the Queen of England to see what she can do .</stage>
   <stage>T. L .— A very good thing to do ! I 'll come with you and explain it all to her . Oho !</stage>
   <stage>C. L .— Are you sure you 're not too fat to walk so far ?</stage>
   <stage>T. L .— Too fat ! Aha ! On the contrary , I shall make you look respectable . We shall be admitted to the Queen at once . I 'll just gobble first to let her know we 're coming .</stage>
   <stage>( Gobbles . They prepare to start as before , TURKY in front . A voice outside is heard . )</stage>
   <stage>VOICE .— Stop ! Stop ! Good people , one moment , if you please .</stage>
   <stage>D. D .— Why it 's Mr. Fox !</stage>
   <stage>H. P .— Is it safe to let him come ?</stage>
   <stage>T. L .— Oh dear , yes ! There are quite enough of us to be a match for him . Oho ! Aha !</stage>
   <stage>Enter MR. FOX .</stage>
   <stage>MR. F .— Good afternoon , my friends . What a pleasant gathering you have here ! You look as though you were going to enjoy yourselves .</stage>
   <stage>C. L .— Alas ! No ! Nothing so festive . We are going to London on most serious business .</stage>
   <stage>MR. F .— To London ?</stage>
   <stage>G. P .— Yes , indeed ! The whole sky has got loose and is slipping about in the most dangerous manner .</stage>
   <stage>D. D .— It would have killed Henny Penny if she had n't got under a beanstack .</stage>
   <stage>MR. F .— Oh how horrible ! What shall we do ?</stage>
   <stage>C. L .— We 're going to London to tell the Queen .</stage>
   <stage>MR. F .— To London ! Why , that is capital ! I 'm going there myself .</stage>
   <stage>D. D .— Are you , indeed !</stage>
   <stage>MR. F .— And what 's more , I know a short cut to London , that will get you there in less than half the time .</stage>
   <stage>C. L .— Oh , then , pray show it to us . Every minute is precious .</stage>
   <stage>MR. F .— You can n't possibly mistake the road . Directly you get out of here , you will see a dark path to the right , that looks rather like the entrance to a cavern . However , you may be sure it leads to London , and you 'll find the Queen sitting at the other end of it .</stage>
   <stage>T. L .— Ah ! that 's capital ! Oho ! Aha ! Hurrah !</stage>
   <stage>MR. F .— You all go on in front , and I 'll bring up the rear , in case a lion comes up behind us .</stage>
   <stage>C. L .— We 'll go in single file this time .</stage>
   <stage>( Exit , each making his own noise . FOX follows , slyly dancing . )</stage>
   <stage>( After a minute all their voices heard together , then a pause . FOX re-enters covered with feathers . He crosses the stage silently , with a smile . )</stage>
   <stage>MR. F .— Henny Penny was the nicest ! The others were rather tough !</stage>
   <p>CURTAIN .</p>
   <p>LITTLE PETSY .</p>
   <p>CHARACTERS .</p>
   <stage>MRS. SIMONDS . MRS. ROBERTS . PETSY .</stage>
   <p>LITTLE PETSY .</p>
   <stage>MRS. ROBERTS discovered , in walking things .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. R .— I wish Mrs. Simonds would appear ! It is so rude to keep people waiting in this way when they come to see you . ( Looks at books , etc . ) Well , I wonder how much longer she 's going to be . I would not have come if I had not wanted to explain to her about that bazaar we are getting up .</stage>
   <stage>Enter PETSY with toys .</stage>
   <stage>Ah , how do you do , darling ? How are you ? Will you shake hands ? ( PETSY turns away . ) You do n't know my name , do you ?</stage>
   <stage>P .— I do , then .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. R .— You do ? Who am I ?</stage>
   <stage>P .— You 're Mrs. Roberts . I know it , because the maid came and told Mamma so , and then Mamma said , “ Mrs. Roberts , bother ! ” and she told me to come and say she would be here in a minute .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. R .— ( Aside . ) Delightful child , this . ( Aloud . ) Then as you know my name , wo n't you shake hands ?</stage>
   <stage>P .— Sha n't .</stage>
   <stage>( Makes a face at MRS. R ., and turns her back to her . )</stage>
   <stage>Enter MRS. SIMONDS .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. S .— Ah , my dear Mrs. Roberts , I am so glad to see you .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. R .— ( Aside . ) So I understand !</stage>
   <stage>( They shake hands . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. S .— I am so sorry to have kept you waiting . I was just taking off my things .</stage>
   <stage>( Draws forward chair for MRS. R ., they sit . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. R .— Oh , not at all . I 've not been here very long .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. S .— I sent down my little Petsy to amuse you .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. R .— Oh , thank you , yes , she came .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. S .— It is impossible to feel dull where she is . Such an original child , so full of life !</stage>
   <stage>MRS. R .— Oh , indeed ! I came to see you , Mrs. Simonds , about the charity bazaar at Wandsworth .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. S .— The bazaar , yes .</stage>
   <stage>P .— ( Loud . ) Ma ! Ma ! How long is she going to stay ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. S .— ( Smiling . ) Oh , dear , dear , Petsy , Mrs. Roberts will be quite shocked at you ! She will really , wo n't you , Mrs. Roberts ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. R .— ( Tries to smile . ) Oh , dear no ! Sweet child !</stage>
   <stage>( PETSY goes on making a noise with drum , while MRS. ROBERTS tries to speak . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. R .— ( Obliged to shout . ) It seems — there has been some difficulty — about the hall .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. S .— About the hall — yes . ( Looking round at PETSY . ) She is such a merry child , it makes one quite happy to see her !</stage>
   <stage>MRS. R .— ( Aside . ) I am glad it has that effect upon some one !</stage>
   <stage>MRS. S .— You were saying about the hall —</stage>
   <stage>P .— Ma ! Mamma !</stage>
   <stage>MRS. S .— Yes , darling , yes . About the hall —</stage>
   <stage>P .— Ma ! Ma ! Ma !</stage>
   <stage>MRS. S .— I do n't know why there should be any difficulty —</stage>
   <stage>P .— Ma ! Ma !</stage>
   <stage>MRS. S .— What is it , my dear one ? What do you want ?</stage>
   <stage>P .— May I play with the silver inkstand ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. S .— If you 'll take great care of it , yes . ( To MRS. R .) Did you ever hear such ideas as the child has ? Such an active mind , never quiet !</stage>
   <stage>MRS. R .— ( Aside . ) Well , perhaps now she 's got the inkstand she 'll be quiet .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. S .— You have no idea what quaint things she says sometimes . You must get me to tell you some of them next time we meet .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. R .— Oh , thank you ! Then you think we shall be able to get the hall ?</stage>
   <stage>P .— ( Goes up to MRS. ROBERTS and pulls her cloak . ) Why do you wear this ugly cloak ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. S .— Oh , really , Petsy ! I do n't know what Mrs. Roberts will think ! Such a pretty cloak , too .</stage>
   <stage>P .— No , it is n't . It 's hideous , and so is her bonnet . It 's like Miss Jane 's cloak in the poem .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. R .— In the poem ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. S .— Yes , that 's a little poem she has learnt . You can n't think what a memory she has for that kind of thing . I should like you to hear her recite it . You can n't think how prettily she does it .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. R .— Does she , indeed .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. S .— Petsy , will you say your poetry to Mrs. Roberts ?</stage>
   <stage>P .— No , I sha n't .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. S .— Oh , now do ! Mrs. Roberts would like it so much , would n't you ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. R .— Oh , of all things .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. S .— She stands on a chair and says it . You can n't think how pretty it looks . Come now , Petsy , wo n't you ?</stage>
   <stage>( MRS. S. puts her on a chair , PETSY jumps down and kicks away the chair . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. R .— Well , never mind — do n't worry her about it now .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. S .— Oh , but I should so like you to hear her . Come , Petsy , you need n't stand on a chair — stand there with your hands behind you . Now begin : “ Pretty Miss Jane —— ”</stage>
   <stage>P .— I wo n't , then ! ( Gives her mother a thump . ) There !</stage>
   <stage>MRS. S .— She 's so unexpected , is n't she ? ( To PETSY . ) If you wo n't say the poem to Mrs. Roberts , you will play the violin to her , wo n't you ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. R .— ( Horrified . ) The violin !</stage>
   <stage>MRS. S .— Yes , she does show such talent ! You 'll be quite surprised .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. R .— ( Aside . ) Yes , I shall be quite surprised if she does .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. S .— Of course , it 's a little squeaky at times — but , after all , she 's such a child , it 's a wonder she plays at all .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. R .— It is indeed . ( Aside . ) Especially to visitors who do n't want to hear her . ( Aloud . ) I am sorry I can n't stay to-day , I just came to see about that hall .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. S .— Ah , to be sure , the hall , yes — we 've settled nothing . Do stay and have tea with us .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. R .— Tea .... I am afraid it is rather late .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. S .— Oh , do stay , we shall be so snug , just we three — for Petsy always comes in . There she sits in her high chair , and keeps me alive with her prattle .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. R .— ( Aside . ) Ah , that quite decides me . ( Aloud . ) I am afraid I can hardly do that to-day . I have an appointment at five . ( Looking at watch . )</stage>
   <stage>P .— Ma ! ( Twitching MRS. S .' s gown . ) May I have butter as well as jam on my toast ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. S .— Oh , oh ! my dear child ! Really ! ( she knows her own mind , I assure you ! )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. R .— ( Aside . ) So it appears . ( Aloud . ) I am afraid I can n't stay longer to-day . Good-bye .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. S .— Good-bye . I 'm so sorry you can n't stay to tea .</stage>
   <stage>P .— I 'm so glad !</stage>
   <stage>MRS. S .— Oh ! Oh ! really , dear Petsy . She likes being alone with her mother , that is the fact .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. R .— No doubt . Then you will let me know about the bazaar , wo n't you ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. S .— Oh , of course , I will , and then you must come here that we may have a good talk and settle everything — and we will persuade Petsy to sing her song , and dance her dance ! she dances like a fairy , I assure you .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. R .— I have no doubt of it . Good-bye .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. S .— Good-bye .</stage>
   <stage>P .— Good-bye , old Mother Roberts , good-bye !</stage>
   <stage>MRS. S .— ( Playfully . ) Oh , Petsy , little Petsy !</stage>
   <stage>( Exit MRS. S. showing MRS. R. out . PETSY pulling MRS. S .' s skirts to hold her back . )</stage>
   <p>CURTAIN .</p>
   <p>RATHER A PRIG .</p>
   <p>CHARACTERS .</p>
   <stage>ELEANOR . WALTER .</stage>
   <p>RATHER A PRIG .</p>
   <stage>ELEANOR .— ( Calling outside . ) Walter ! Walter ! ( Running in . ) Here you are , at last ! Do come and play in the garden !</stage>
   <stage>WALTER .— ( Who is walking about with a book . ) Certainly not ! Do n't you see I am deep in study ?</stage>
   <stage>E .— But it 's play-time .</stage>
   <stage>W .— I dislike play-time .</stage>
   <stage>E .— What a dull creature ! Do you mean to say that you never play ?</stage>
   <stage>W .— As seldom as possible .</stage>
   <stage>E .— What a pity ! I have just got some new reins , and I wanted to play at horses . I do love being a horse .</stage>
   <stage>W .— That is a natural preference . The horse has ever been a favoured companion of man . It is even on record that the Roman Emperor , Caligula ——</stage>
   <stage>E .— I will not talk about Roman Emperors during play-time . Come along , I will drag the cart and you shall drive standing up , if you like , as they do at the circus .</stage>
   <stage>W .— That is a custom which dates from the most remote antiquity . Pictorial representations of standing charioteers are found on the Assyrian friezes and the Egyptian tombs ——</stage>
   <stage>E .— ( Stopping her ears . ) I will not talk about the Egyptians during play-time . Come , will you drive the cart ?</stage>
   <stage>W .— Certainly not .</stage>
   <stage>E .— Then shall we skip ? Look , I have a new skipping-rope , which my father gave me last week .</stage>
   <stage>W .— The hemp from which that rope was made was doubtless derived from the flax grown in the province of Ulster , in Ireland , especially in the county of Antrim , of which the principal towns are Belfast , Lisbon , and Carrickfergus .</stage>
   <stage>E .— Oh , bother the county of Antrim and the province of Ulster ! I do n't care to know where the skipping-rope grew . I want to skip with it .</stage>
   <stage>W .— That is quite a savage instinct ; the remarkable agility of the South Sea Islanders ——</stage>
   <stage>E .— I wo n't talk of the South Sea Islanders during play-time . You wo n't skip , then ?</stage>
   <stage>W .— Certainly not .</stage>
   <stage>E .— Then let 's be soldiers . I love playing at soldiers .</stage>
   <stage>W .— That is somewhat of an unfeminine instinct , although it is justified by more than one example in history . Thus , Boadicea ——</stage>
   <stage>E .— Oh , shut up , or I will run you through with my sword ! It 's just like a real one . It 's made of the most beautiful steel .</stage>
   <stage>W .— Then the blade probably came from the district of Cleveland in Yorkshire , where the iron and steel industries may be seen in their greatest development . You have , doubtless , heard of the steel works of Eston , and the blast furnaces of Middlesborough ?</stage>
   <stage>E .— I do n't know what a blast furnace is .</stage>
   <stage>W .— Allow me to describe that ingenious construction to you .</stage>
   <stage>E .— No , thank you , not in my play-time . I am going to get some daisies to make a daisy-chain .</stage>
   <stage>W .— You doubtless have a herbarium ?</stage>
   <stage>E .— No . I do n't believe they grow in this garden .</stage>
   <stage>W .— Oh , too ignorant girl ! A herbarium is not a flower , it is a collection of dried flowers and plants .</stage>
   <stage>E .— Ah , well ! I have n't one then .</stage>
   <stage>W .— That is a mistake . You should carefully dry the plants and stick them in a book , with a minute description of each specimen written on the opposite page .</stage>
   <stage>E .— I can n't stick anything in a book , because Mamma does n't like me to use her gum , and I have only fish-glue .</stage>
   <stage>W .— Fish-glue is , for certain purposes , a most valuable substance . It has even been known to cure cecity or blindness . Thus , Tobit ——</stage>
   <stage>E .— Do n't talk about Tobit . Are you coming to make a daisy-chain ?</stage>
   <stage>W .— Never .</stage>
   <stage>E .— Shall we play at battledore ? I have a heavy shuttlecock and a light one , whichever you like best .</stage>
   <stage>W .— That is because the density of cork varies in a very marked manner . That brought from the West Indies ——</stage>
   <stage>E .— Do n't talk about the West Indies during play-time . Are you coming to play at battledore ?</stage>
   <stage>W .— On no account .</stage>
   <stage>E .— Very well , then , you may stay with your Egyptians , your South Sea Islanders , and your West Indies , while I go and play in the garden . I think you are rather a prig . ( Exit . )</stage>
   <stage>W .— ( Looking after her , surprised . ) A prig ! How odd ! I wonder what makes her say that ? Rather a prig !</stage>
   <p>THE MONSTER IN THE GARDEN .</p>
   <p>CHARACTERS .</p>
   <stage>JACK . JANET . MABEL . AUNT MARY .</stage>
   <p>THE MONSTER IN THE GARDEN .</p>
   <stage>JANET .— Come , I want to go into the garden .</stage>
   <stage>MABEL .— We must have Tiny with us .</stage>
   <stage>JAN .— Of course , where is he , I wonder ? Tiny ! Tiny !</stage>
   <stage>M .— Tiny ! Tiny ! Stupid little dog ! He is always away when one wants him .</stage>
   <stage>JAN .— Perhaps he is in the garden already .</stage>
   <stage>M .— Perhaps he is . We 'll go and see .</stage>
   <stage>JAN .— Ah ! here is Jack , perhaps he has seen Tiny .</stage>
   <stage>Enter JACK .</stage>
   <stage>M .— Have you seen Tiny ?</stage>
   <stage>JACK .— Tiny ? No , I have n't , indeed . Oh dear me ! I am so frightened .</stage>
   <stage>JAN .— What 's the matter ?</stage>
   <stage>JACK .— I 've seen the most terrible monster in the garden .</stage>
   <stage>M. and Jan .— A monster !</stage>
   <stage>JACK .— A monster , in the garden .</stage>
   <stage>JAN .— Oh , Mabel , hold my hand ! ( To JACK . ) Did you see him ?</stage>
   <stage>JACK .— Well , I did not see him exactly , because he was inside that clump of laurels , but I certainly heard him growl .</stage>
   <stage>M .— ( Getting very close to JANET . ) Growl ? Oh dear !</stage>
   <stage>JACK .— Then I believe I saw two great eyes looking at me .</stage>
   <stage>M .— Two great eyes ?</stage>
   <stage>JACK .— Then I am certain I saw the point of a hairy ear , the sort of point that a great monster 's ear would be sure to have .</stage>
   <stage>M .— Then , of course , now we wo n't go into the garden .</stage>
   <stage>JAN .— I 've just thought of the most terrible thing !</stage>
   <stage>JACK .— What is it ?</stage>
   <stage>M .— What is it ?</stage>
   <stage>JAN .— ( Covering her face . ) That Tiny is in the garden !</stage>
   <stage>M .— And he will be eaten alive !</stage>
   <stage>( Covering her face with her hands , and sobbing loudly . )</stage>
   <stage>JAN .— What shall we do ? We can n't leave him to die .</stage>
   <stage>JACK .— ( Valiantly . ) No , we can n't . I will go and save him .</stage>
   <stage>M .— Oh , you brave boy ! We 'll come too .</stage>
   <stage>JACK .— Come , then ! I 've got my knife .</stage>
   <stage>( Pulls his knife out of his pocket . )</stage>
   <stage>JAN .— And I 'll take my new scissors .</stage>
   <stage>M .— And what shall I have ? Oh , I 'll take two large hairpins to stab him with .</stage>
   <stage>JACK .— That 's right . We 'll stab him through the heart .</stage>
   <stage>Enter AUNT MARY .</stage>
   <stage>AUNT MARY .— Why , my dear children ! How warlike you look !</stage>
   <stage>JACK .— And well we may ! We 're going into the garden to kill the most terrible monster .</stage>
   <stage>A. M .— Oh , I see , you are pretending to be warriors .</stage>
   <stage>JAN .— No , indeed ! We are not . It is a real monster in the garden . Jack has seen him — part of him , at least .</stage>
   <stage>A. M .— And what was he like ?</stage>
   <stage>JACK .— He 's an enormous animal , with great flaring eyes , and long hairy ears .</stage>
   <stage>JAN .— And probably horns and tusks , but we 're not quite sure , because he was behind the bushes .</stage>
   <stage>M .— And we are so dreadfully afraid he will kill Tiny .</stage>
   <stage>A. M .— Oh no ! He wo n't find Tiny — Tiny is hidden behind the laurels near the conservatory , eating a mouse which he has just caught .</stage>
   <stage>JACK .— Behind the laurels near the conservatory ! Then he will certainly be killed ! The monster is there too ! That is where the growls came from !</stage>
   <stage>A. M .— Ha ! ha ! Now I see it all ! Why , the monster that Jack saw and heard , is simply Tiny , who was growling because he feared his mouse would be taken away from him .</stage>
   <stage>JACK .— Are you sure ?</stage>
   <stage>JAN .— Was the monster Tiny ?</stage>
   <stage>A. M .— Evidently . I 've just seen him there myself .</stage>
   <stage>M .— Oh , how delightful ! let us go and tell Tiny there is no monster in the garden !</stage>
   <stage>( Exeunt running , followed by AUNT MARY . )</stage>
   <p>CAT AND DOG .</p>
   <p>CHARACTERS .</p>
   <stage>TOWSER . PUSSY .</stage>
   <p>CAT AND DOG .</p>
   <stage>TOWSER .— What a night ! I am tied up in the yard , and told to bark if I hear a noise . Suddenly I hear a screeching and pecking in the poultry-yard , fowls flapping about in all directions . Of course I bark as loud as I can , my master comes out to see what it is about , he finds one of the hens missing , and beats me as if I had killed it . I do call that hard on a steady , respectable dog like me .</stage>
   <stage>Enter PUSSY without seeing TOWSER .</stage>
   <stage>PUSSY .— Well , I do call it hard ! Everything that is broken in the house , they say is done by the cat . Now , this morning , again , a beautiful Venetian looking-glass is broken , and so my mistress would not give me a saucer of cream for breakfast .</stage>
   <stage>T .— ( Seeing PUSSY . ) Bow ! Wow !</stage>
   <stage>P .— Mew ! Mew !</stage>
   <stage>T .— Good-morning , Mistress Pussy .</stage>
   <stage>P .— Good-morning , Mr. Towser . I hope you 're well .</stage>
   <stage>T .— I am very tired . I had to bark a great deal in the night .</stage>
   <stage>P .— Really ! I am sorry to hear that . You must do as I do , come and sleep on the hearth-rug during the day .</stage>
   <stage>T .— I only wish I could , but I am much too busy a dog for that .</stage>
   <stage>P .— Are you ? What do you do all day ?</stage>
   <stage>T .— First of all , I have to be ready to bite the postman 's legs when he comes at eight , and then to bark at him as he goes across the road .</stage>
   <stage>P .— It must be difficult to bark — I am sure I should never manage it .</stage>
   <stage>T .— It is very difficult indeed — I am the only person in the house that can manage it . Then when the postman has gone , I go into the kitchen to help the cook to get rid of the bones and scraps that are left .</stage>
   <stage>P .— The worst of bones is , they are so dreadfully hard . I much prefer a saucer of milk , or a fish 's tail . Oh how delicious that is !</stage>
   <stage>T .— Oh , I could n't touch a fish 's tail . Then when my master is at breakfast , I have to beg , and that is very hard work , as I am on my legs all the time , balancing things on my nose .</stage>
   <stage>P .— If I were you , I would arch my back instead , and rub myself against the master 's legs .</stage>
   <stage>T .— Of course I could arch my back if I wanted to do so , but I do n't care to . Then after breakfast , I have a few minutes ’ rest before the fire .</stage>
   <stage>P .— Oh , is n't that comfortable ! Rolled round in a basket . It is so nice to purr a little , and then gradually go off to sleep .</stage>
   <stage>T .— To tell the truth , I do n't care to purr , I think it is so stupid . One might as well be a kettle or a bumble bee at once . What I like to do is to come and scratch at the door , just after it has been shut , to smell round the rug , to turn round two or three times , and then lie down quietly .</stage>
   <stage>P .— To curl round with one 's head nestled in between one 's fore-paws .</stage>
   <stage>T .— Oh , I like to sleep with my paws straight out .</stage>
   <stage>P .— The result is , you do n't sleep nearly so long .</stage>
   <stage>T .— Because I have n't time . Then when my mistress goes out driving , I have to bark at the pony when he starts . And I have to go out with the carriage , and pay visits , and I jump upon strange people 's laps , and make their dresses all muddy in front .</stage>
   <stage>P .— That must be delightful ! But I should n't care to go with the carriage , I would rather stay at home and enjoy myself , and scratch the visitors who come here . By the way , can you draw in your claws ?</stage>
   <stage>T .— Draw them in ! Certainly not .</stage>
   <stage>P .— You do n't mean to say you can n't do such a simple thing as that ?</stage>
   <stage>T .— Of course I could if I liked , but I do n't choose . I think you ought to make up your mind either to have claws , or not to have them : not to be popping them in and out as you do .</stage>
   <stage>P .— But it 's so convenient when I walk about at night , to be able to steal about gently and then shoot out my claws when I see a mouse .</stage>
   <stage>T .— Oh , how tempting that sounds ! Then it 's always at night you hunt ?</stage>
   <stage>P .— Oh , always . There is no one to see or to disturb you .</stage>
   <stage>T .— Exactly . Now , when I go out with my master , if I go after a hen or a rabbit , I am beaten at once .</stage>
   <stage>P .— Fancy being beaten for a hen !</stage>
   <stage>T .— Is n't it absurd ! Just for an idiotic bird like that !</stage>
   <stage>P .— Who can n't lap , or scratch !</stage>
   <stage>T .— Nor bark , nor do anything !</stage>
   <stage>P .— Never mind . I killed one last night , I am glad to say .</stage>
   <stage>T .— You killed a hen ?</stage>
   <stage>P .— Certainly .</stage>
   <stage>T .— Well , I do call that hard on me ! My master beat me as hard as he could because of that hen .</stage>
   <stage>P .— Well ! Were you beaten for that wretched , tough old hen ? That is funny !</stage>
   <stage>T .— Yes , that is a good joke , madam , I dare say ! But we shall see .</stage>
   <stage>P .— Do n't be angry about such a trifle .</stage>
   <stage>T .— I will be revenged still more . I have already broken a Venetian looking-glass , to show my indignation .</stage>
   <stage>P .— Was it you who broke the looking-glass ?</stage>
   <stage>T .— Certainly it was .</stage>
   <stage>P .— Then we are quits . My mistress insisted that I had broken it , and would not give me my saucer of cream .</stage>
   <stage>T .— Oh , that really is funny ! We are quits , then . Shall we be friends again ?</stage>
   <stage>P .— Certainly , if you like .</stage>
   <stage>T .— And , as a proof of our friendship , next time you come to kill the hens , I wo n't bark .</stage>
   <stage>P .— That 's a bargain . I 'll steal two more to-night , and give you one .</stage>
   <stage>T .— Oh , what a good plan ! Let 's go and choose them .</stage>
   <stage>P .— Two nice fat ones !</stage>
   <stage>( He offers her his arm . He says “ Bow ! Wow ! ” She says “ Mew ! Mew ! ” They go out . )</stage>
   <p>MISS DOBSON .</p>
   <p>CHARACTERS .</p>
   <stage>BERTHA . EVA . DOROTHEA . FANNY .</stage>
   <p>MISS DOBSON .</p>
   <stage>ALL entering together .</stage>
   <stage>BERTHA .— Are we very late , Miss Dobson ?</stage>
   <stage>( Looking round them . )</stage>
   <stage>DOROTHEA .— Why , there is nobody here !</stage>
   <stage>FANNY .— Where can she be ?</stage>
   <stage>EVA .— Perhaps she is late .</stage>
   <stage>B .— Miss Dobson is never late .</stage>
   <stage>F .— What is that letter on the table ? Why , it 's her writing ! It 's a letter from Miss Dobson !</stage>
   <stage>F .— With our names written on it !</stage>
   <stage>D .— It must be to say why she has not come .</stage>
   <stage>B .— Quick ! Let 's open it .</stage>
   <stage>E .— ( Snatches at it . ) No , no , I 'll open it .</stage>
   <stage>D .— Let us all open it together , and read it at the same time .</stage>
   <stage>ALL .— Capital !</stage>
   <stage>( They all rush at the letter which they tear in two . )</stage>
   <stage>D .— Now , then , what shall we do ?</stage>
   <stage>B .— We shall have so much less to read .</stage>
   <stage>E .— Let us see what is on this piece .</stage>
   <stage>ALL .— ( Reading together . ) “ My dear children , I am obliged to go off to Clapham by the ten o'clock train , to see my mother who is ill . ”</stage>
   <stage>D .— Go to Clapham !</stage>
   <stage>F .— By the ten o'clock train !</stage>
   <stage>B .— To see her mother who is ill !</stage>
   <stage>E .— Oh , how delightful !</stage>
   <stage>B .— How delightful that her mother should be ill ?</stage>
   <stage>E .— No , of course not . I mean , how terrible !</stage>
   <stage>ALL .— Poor Miss Dobson 's mother !</stage>
   <stage>D .— Come , let us see what else she says .</stage>
   <stage>ALL .— ( Reading . ) “ I shall not be back until the evening . ”</stage>
   <stage>F .— She wo n't be back until the evening !</stage>
   <stage>E .— We shall have a holiday then ! ( All dancing round . ) A holiday ! A holiday !</stage>
   <stage>D .— Here 's the other piece of the letter which we have n't read . ( They pick it up and read it . )</stage>
   <stage>D .— ( Reading . ) “ I hope you will be good children , and work by yourselves . ”</stage>
   <stage>ALL .— Work by ourselves !</stage>
   <stage>D .— ( Reading . ) “ You can prepare your German , history , and geography , and do some drawing and practising . ”</stage>
   <stage>F .— I never heard such a thing .</stage>
   <stage>B .— I do call that a shame !</stage>
   <stage>D .— It 's horrid doing one 's lessons alone .</stage>
   <stage>E .— But still , it 's nice not being scolded when one makes mistakes .</stage>
   <stage>F .— I am quite sure I can n't do my geography alone , because I never can find the additional towns on the map .</stage>
   <stage>E .— Besides , Mamma does not like us to bend over the atlas , she says it is bad for the eyes .</stage>
   <stage>D .— As for the drawing , we certainly can n't do it , because Miss Dobson has got the key of the cupboard , where the soft pencils are .</stage>
   <stage>B .— And as for the German , I never can find the words in the dictionary .</stage>
   <stage>E .— And I certainly can n't practise alone , because I never know where to put my thumb in the scale of F sharp minor .</stage>
   <stage>F .— And I never know where to put my little finger in the scale of B .</stage>
   <stage>D .— Then the only thing we can do alone is the history .</stage>
   <stage>B .— And there will be quite time enough for that this afternoon .</stage>
   <stage>F .— Then , in that case , we have our whole morning free .</stage>
   <stage>B .— Oh , how delightful !</stage>
   <stage>E .— Let 's play at hide-and-seek .</stage>
   <stage>F .— You all hide , and I 'll come and look for you .</stage>
   <stage>( Hides her face in her hands . The others go towards the door . A bell is heard . They stop . )</stage>
   <stage>F .— ( Uncovering her eyes . ) A bell !</stage>
   <stage>E .— Who can it be ? ( They listen . )</stage>
   <stage>E .— Suppose it were Miss Dobson !</stage>
   <stage>B .— I 'll go and see . ( Exit . )</stage>
   <stage>F .— What shall we say if it is Miss Dobson ?</stage>
   <stage>D .— That we were going to play at hide-and-seek instead of doing our lessons !</stage>
   <stage>E .— The point is , what will she say !</stage>
   <stage>D .— She 'll say a good deal .</stage>
   <stage>Re-enter BERTHA .</stage>
   <stage>B .— It is Miss Dobson ! Her mother is much better . Her sister sent a telegram , and so she did not go to Clapham after all .</stage>
   <stage>F .— What shall we do ?</stage>
   <stage>D .— Let 's go and tell her how glad we are she has such good news .</stage>
   <stage>B .— Yes , and let 's ask for a holiday to celebrate her mother 's recovery .</stage>
   <stage>F .— Excellent ! Let 's go and meet her .</stage>

   <stage>THE WIGWAM ; or , THE LITTLE GIRL FROM TOWN .</stage>
   <p>CHARACTERS .</p>
   <stage>ELSIE . MARY . FANNY .</stage>
   <p>THE WIGWAM : OR THE LITTLE GIRL FROM TOWN .</p>
   <stage>ELSIE .— Is n't it delightful that Fanny is coming from London to spend the day with us .</stage>
   <stage>MARY .— Indeed it is . We must show her everything as soon as she comes .</stage>
   <stage>E .— Yes , directly — and the first thing must be the wigwam .</stage>
   <stage>M .— Of course it must , and we will tell her all about it , and that it is our own hut in the garden that we have arranged ourselves .</stage>
   <stage>E .— Or shall we make her guess who made it ?</stage>
   <stage>M .— Oh yes ! That would be lovely ! We will take her there , and tell her to shut her eyes quite tight .</stage>
   <stage>E .— Then she wo n't be able to see the wigwam .</stage>
   <stage>M .— No , that 's true . Then she must have them shut all the way through the garden .</stage>
   <stage>E .— And when she gets there , we will say : “ Open your eyes , and guess whose wigwam this is ” .</stage>
   <stage>M .— And , when she has guessed that , we will say : “ Now guess who painted it ” .</stage>
   <stage>E .— And , when she has guessed that , we will say : “ Now guess who furnished it ” .</stage>
   <stage>M .— And , when she has guessed that , we 'll say : “ Guess who papered it ” .</stage>
   <stage>E .— She 'll be rather stupid if she does not guess that time whose it is .</stage>
   <stage>M .— But , you know , little girls from London are very often stupid , when they come into the country .</stage>
   <stage>E .— That 's true . Do you remember when Amy came , she did not know the difference between a goose and a duck ?</stage>
   <stage>M .— And she was afraid of the turkey-cock !</stage>
   <stage>E .— And she looked at an oak , and said how very small the chestnuts were !</stage>
   <stage>M .— There 's the door-bell . There they are ! Now , mind , I am the eldest , so I shall say : “ Now , I am going to show you the wigwam ” as soon as she comes in .</stage>
   <stage>E .— Before we shake hands ?</stage>
   <stage>M .— No ! no ! After we shake hands .</stage>
   <stage>E .— I think I ought to say it too , you know .</stage>
   <stage>M .— It would be absurd both saying it together , she wo n't understand .</stage>
   <stage>E .— Oh , yes ! she will , if we say it loud and slowly , like this , now then you say it with me ( both together ): We-are-going-to-show-you-the-wigwam ! !</stage>
   <stage>M .— Capital ! There she is !</stage>
   <stage>Enter FANNY .</stage>
   <stage>E. and M .— ( Running round her . ) How do you do ? How do you do ?</stage>
   <stage>( FANNY smoothes her dress which they have crumpled . ELSIE and MARY look at each other . )</stage>
   <stage>E. and M .— ( Together . ) We are going to show you the wigwam . ( Very loud and distinctly . )</stage>
   <stage>( FANNY puts her hands over her ears . )</stage>
   <stage>F .— Oh , how loudly you talk ! One at a time , if you please . It makes me ill when you shout like that .</stage>
   <stage>E .— We said we were going to show you the wigwam .</stage>
   <stage>F .— What 's that ? I hate insects .</stage>
   <stage>M .— It is n't an insect ! it 's a hut in the garden .</stage>
   <stage>F .— That 's not so bad . Dear me ! how tired I am . ( Looks round for a chair . )</stage>
   <stage>E .— ( Giving her a chair . ) What has tired you so much ?</stage>
   <stage>F .— Why , we walked all the way from the station .</stage>
   <stage>M .— The station ! Why , it 's barely five minutes from here .</stage>
   <stage>F .— I do n't care how long it is , it tired me all the same .</stage>
   <stage>E .— We 'll go to the wigwam when you are rested .</stage>
   <stage>F .— How far is it ?</stage>
   <stage>M .— Just across the garden , on the other side of the lawn .</stage>
   <stage>F .— If I walk across the grass I shall get my feet wet .</stage>
   <stage>E .— Then we 'll go by the gravel walk , it 's only a few seconds longer .</stage>
   <stage>F .— If I walk on the gravel I shall spoil my kid boots .</stage>
   <stage>M .— You ought to have strong boots like ours for the country .</stage>
   <stage>F .— I can n't bear those clumsy boots !</stage>
   <stage>E .— Then how are you going to get to the wigwam ?</stage>
   <stage>F .— Why should we go there at all ?</stage>
   <stage>M .— Because we wanted to show it to you .</stage>
   <stage>F .— Why ?</stage>
   <stage>M .— We want you to guess who furnished it .</stage>
   <stage>F .— The carpenter , I suppose , or the upholsterer , or whoever does those things .</stage>
   <stage>M .— No , we did it .</stage>
   <stage>F .— You !</stage>
   <stage>M .— We papered and painted it all ourselves .</stage>
   <stage>F .— Oh how disgusting !</stage>
   <stage>E .— Disgusting ! it was delightful . We did it with paste and with Aspinall .</stage>
   <stage>M .— I love Aspinall .</stage>
   <stage>F .— I do n't . I hate having paint on my fingers .</stage>
   <stage>E .— And the paste is quite clean — it 's only flour and water .</stage>
   <stage>F .— Flour and water ! Ugh ! I can n't bear things that make one 's fingers sticky .</stage>
   <stage>E .— After all , it is very easy to wash off .</stage>
   <stage>F .— I do n't like to wash my hands too often , it spoils my skin .</stage>
   <stage>E .— Besides , of course , you need not touch either the paste or the paint .</stage>
   <stage>F .— What shall I do then ?</stage>
   <stage>E .— You shall sit down and look round you .</stage>
   <stage>F .— Sit on what ?</stage>
   <stage>E .— On an old packing-case covered with chintz ! You have no idea what a comfortable seat it makes .</stage>
   <stage>F .— A packing-case ! I am sure there would be nails in it that would catch on my dress . I would rather sit in the house on a proper chair .</stage>
   <stage>E .— But you surely do n't want to stay in all day , when the sun is shining like this ?</stage>
   <stage>F .— That 's just it , I do n't like to sit in the sun . I shall get freckled .</stage>
   <stage>M .— Do you like to be out in the damp , then ?</stage>
   <stage>F .— Oh no , indeed ! It takes the curl out of my hair .</stage>
   <stage>M .— What shall we do , then ? It 's so dull sitting in here .</stage>
   <stage>F .— Very ! but I knew before I came it would be dull .</stage>
   <stage>M .— ( Aside . ) Is n't she rude !</stage>
   <stage>E .— ( Aside . ) Hush ! ( To FANNY . ) I 'll tell you what we will do . We 'll go into the poultry-yard , it is shady there .</stage>
   <stage>F .— Well , what is there to see in the poultry-yard ?</stage>
   <stage>E .— Oh , all sorts of things . We can look for eggs and bring in some for breakfast .</stage>
   <stage>F .— I think the servants ought to do that .</stage>
   <stage>M .— Or we can feed the hens .</stage>
   <stage>F .— I would n't for worlds ! I hate things that come flapping and pecking round my feet .</stage>
   <stage>M .— Then let 's go into the stable and we will show you our ponies .</stage>
   <stage>F .— Oh , no ! Stables are so smelly , I can n't bear them .</stage>
   <stage>E .— Well , is there anything you would like to do ? What do you do in London ?</stage>
   <stage>F .— I like driving through the streets in an open carriage and looking at the shops .</stage>
   <stage>M .— In that case , you had better have remained in London , as there are no streets here and no shops .</stage>
   <stage>F .— Very well ! I shall go and tell my mother that I want to go back .</stage>
   <stage>M .— You had better ! ( Exit FANNY R .) Come , Elsie , let us go to the wigwam . ( They go out L .)</stage>

   <p>CHARACTERS .</p>
   <stage>JACK . HIS MOTHER .</stage>
   <p>FOOLISH JACK .</p>
   <stage>MOTHER .— ( Alone . ) Jack ! Jack ! Where is the boy ? He can never stay in the house . He must always be running round to all the neighbours . Ah , there he is at last !</stage>
   <stage>Enter JACK .</stage>
   <stage>J .— Well , mother , how are you ?</stage>
   <stage>M .— I was getting anxious about you . Where have you been all this time ?</stage>
   <stage>J .— Oh , I 've been seeing the neighbours .</stage>
   <stage>M .— I thought as much . Which neighbours ?</stage>
   <stage>J .— First I went to see Father Clumpylump .</stage>
   <stage>M .— Indeed ! Father Clumpylump ! Honest man ! And what did he say to you ?</stage>
   <stage>J .— He gave me a needle for a present .</stage>
   <stage>M .— A most useful present ! Where is it ?</stage>
   <stage>J .— I stuck it into a bundle of hay that was standing in a cart , and then I could not find it again .</stage>
   <stage>M .— I should think not , indeed ! You ought to have stuck it into your sleeve .</stage>
   <stage>J .— That 's just what Father Clumpylump said .</stage>
   <stage>M .— And he was quite right . And then ?</stage>
   <stage>J .— Then I went to call on Goody Grumbles .</stage>
   <stage>M .— Indeed ! Goody Grumbles , dear , old soul ! And what had she to say ?</stage>
   <stage>J .— Not much ; but she gave me a knife .</stage>
   <stage>M .— A knife ! Another most useful present ! Where is it , then ?</stage>
   <stage>J .— I stuck it into my sleeve , and it fell out on the way .</stage>
   <stage>M .— Of course it did . You ought to have put it into your pocket .</stage>
   <stage>J .— That 's just what Goody Grumbles said .</stage>
   <stage>M .— And she was quite right . And then ?</stage>
   <stage>J .— And then I went to see Uncle Crabstick .</stage>
   <stage>M .— Uncle Crabstick ! Did he give you anything ?</stage>
   <stage>J .— Yes , he gave me a lamb .</stage>
   <stage>M .— A lamb ! How delightful ! Where is it , then ?</stage>
   <stage>J .— I crammed it into my pocket , and it was stifled .</stage>
   <stage>M .— I should think it was ! Into your pocket ! Good heavens ! Whoever thought of putting a lamb into his pocket ! You should have tied a rope round its neck and led it carefully along .</stage>
   <stage>J .— That 's just what Uncle Crabstick said .</stage>
   <stage>M .— I should think he did ! And then ?</stage>
   <stage>J .— Then I went to see Auntie Jumblewig .</stage>
   <stage>M .— That was quite right . Did she give you anything ?</stage>
   <stage>J .— She gave me a splendid ham .</stage>
   <stage>M .— A ham ! I am glad . That will come in useful . Where is it ?</stage>
   <stage>J .— I tied a rope to it , and led it carefully along the road , but some dogs ate it up while I was not looking .</stage>
   <stage>M .— Of course they did , you foolish boy ! You should have carried it on your head .</stage>
   <stage>J .— That 's just what Auntie Jumblewig said when she saw me start .</stage>
   <stage>M .— Of course she did ! and then ?</stage>
   <stage>J .— I went to see Cousin Peter .</stage>
   <stage>M .— Cousin Peter ! And what did the good man say to you ?</stage>
   <stage>J .— Not much ; but he gave me a calf .</stage>
   <stage>M .— A calf ! How generous ! Where is the calf then ?</stage>
   <stage>J .— I tried to carry it on my head , but he kicked my face , so I let him go .</stage>
   <stage>M .— Serve you right ! How could you be so foolish as to carry a calf on your head ? You should have taken him to the cow-house and settled him in a nice warm corner , with plenty of straw .</stage>
   <stage>J .— That is just what Cousin Peter advised me to do .</stage>
   <stage>M .— He was quite right . And then ?</stage>
   <stage>J .— I went to see Rose .</stage>
   <stage>M .— I am glad you went there . Rose is a charming girl . Was she well disposed towards you ?</stage>
   <stage>J .— Very . Indeed , she came here with me .</stage>
   <stage>M .— Where is she , then ?</stage>
   <stage>J .— I took her to the cow-house , and settled her in a nice , warm corner , with plenty of straw .</stage>
   <stage>M .— In the cow-house ! Rose ! Wretched boy ! You should have brought her into the best parlour , and asked her to marry you .</stage>
   <stage>J .— That 's just what she said .</stage>
   <stage>M .— And she was quite right . Quick ! Quick ! Let us fetch her .</stage>
   <stage>J .— I should like that very much .</stage>
   <stage>M .— Come , then , at once ! Oh , you foolish Jack ! ( Exeunt . )</stage>
   <p>QUITE BY OURSELVES .</p>
   <p>CHARACTERS .</p>
   <stage>MRS. VERNON . JANET . RALPH .</stage>
   <p>QUITE BY OURSELVES .</p>
   <stage>MRS . VERNON .— ( Alone at writing table . ) What a long time it is since the children have been into the room ! It must be nearly five minutes ! They do n't seem to be having as many “ good ideas ” to-day as they generally do . So I may as well do my accounts . ( Begins to add up . ) Ah ! there they come .</stage>
   <stage>Enter RALPH and JANET , hurriedly .</stage>
   <stage>JANET .— Mammy ! Mammy !</stage>
   <stage>RALPH .— We have such a good idea .</stage>
   <stage>MOTHER .— ( I thought so ! ) What is it ?</stage>
   <stage>J .— We 're going to surprise you very much .</stage>
   <stage>M .— Are you ? How delightful !</stage>
   <stage>R .— We 're going to invite you to a tea party of our very own !</stage>
   <stage>J .— We are going to get it ready and arrange it quite by ourselves !</stage>
   <stage>R .— Is n't that a lovely idea ?</stage>
   <stage>M .— It is , indeed .</stage>
   <stage>J .— And the surprise is going to be that you are going to receive an invitation from us , just like the real invitations you get from your friends .</stage>
   <stage>M .— I see !</stage>
   <stage>R .— But the thing that will surprise you most will be that we are going to do it ourselves , wo n't it ?</stage>
   <stage>M .— ( Smiling . ) Yes , I must say that will be the most surprising thing of all .</stage>
   <stage>R .— Then , first , here 's the invitation .</stage>
   <stage>M .— Oh , this is most exciting . ( Reads . ) “ Ralph and Janet request the pleasure of your company at their very own tea-party on Wednesday afternoon . ”</stage>
   <stage>R .— Is n't that a surprise for you , Mammy ?</stage>
   <stage>M .— It is , indeed , most astonishing . Now I must answer this , I suppose ?</stage>
   <stage>J .— Of course you must , just as if you were writing to strangers , you must end it “ your loving Mrs. Vernon , ” or something stiff of that sort .</stage>
   <stage>R .— Of course you must n't put “ your affectionate Mother , ” as you do when you really write to us , you know .</stage>
   <stage>M .— Not for worlds ! Now , then , I had better write the letter , and then do my accounts , while you get the tea ready .</stage>
   <stage>R .— Oh , yes , that will be delightful .</stage>
   <stage>( Goes to writing-table . RALPH and JANET discuss in a low voice , looking round them helplessly . )</stage>
   <stage>R .— ( Aside to JANET . ) We had better ask Mammy , I think .</stage>
   <stage>J .— Much better .</stage>
   <stage>R .— ( Aloud . ) Mammy , there is just one thing we want to ask you .</stage>
   <stage>M .— Yes ? What is it ?</stage>
   <stage>J .— Where do you think we had better have tea ?</stage>
   <stage>M .— Wherever you like . What do you say to the dining-room ?</stage>
   <stage>R .— The dining-room is so common .</stage>
   <stage>M .— You may have it in here if you like .</stage>
   <stage>J .— Oh , that would be the very thing !</stage>
   <stage>R .— What table shall we have it on ?</stage>
   <stage>M .— ( Looking round . ) Let me see — would that one do ?</stage>
   <stage>R .— Oh , beautifully . Thank you so much , Mammy .</stage>
   <stage>( They pull out the table and open it , while the mother writes . )</stage>
   <stage>J .— Now , what next ?</stage>
   <stage>R .— The cloth , of course .</stage>
   <stage>J .— I wonder where we can get one .</stage>
   <stage>R .— Mammy !</stage>
   <stage>M .— Well ?</stage>
   <stage>R .— What about a table-cloth ?</stage>
   <stage>M .— Had n't you better ask Susan for one of the dining-room ones ?</stage>
   <stage>R .— Susan is always cross when we ask her for that kind of thing , she seems to think we make jam and cocoa stains on the table-cloths .</stage>
   <stage>M .— Dear me , I wonder what can make her think that ?</stage>
   <stage>R .— I think it must be because Janet always spills the jam at breakfast .</stage>
   <stage>J .— You need n't talk , for once you dropped a whole cutlet on to your knicker-bockers .</stage>
   <stage>R .— But as we are not going to have cutlets , you need n't talk about it now .</stage>
   <stage>M .— I do n't think people ought to quarrel when they 're giving a tea-party .</stage>
   <stage>R .— No , we 'll quarrel after tea , we 're too busy now .</stage>
   <stage>J .— Much !</stage>
   <stage>R .— Well , what about the table-cloth , then ?</stage>
   <stage>M .— If you do n't want to ask Susan I might lend you that embroidered five o'clock teahYpppHeNcloth which I bought at the bazaar the other day .</stage>
   <stage>R .— Oh , that would be the very thing ! May we have it ?</stage>
   <stage>M .— Yes , if you like , it is in that drawer .</stage>
   <stage>R .— Which drawer ?</stage>
   <stage>M .— The bottom one .</stage>
   <stage>( RALPH opens the top one . JANET and he look in and look wonderingly at each other , and then shake their heads . )</stage>
   <stage>R .— Mammy , we can n't find it .</stage>
   <stage>M .— Are you quite sure you are looking in the right drawer ?</stage>
   <stage>R .— Quite . You said the top drawer , did n't you ?</stage>
   <stage>M .— No . I said the bottom drawer .</stage>
   <stage>R .— Oh , I thought you said the top drawer . ( They look in . To JANET . ) I wonder where it can be ! ( After a moment . ) Mammy , I am so very sorry — we can n't find it .</stage>
   <stage>M .— ( Gets up . ) How very odd . I saw it there yesterday . Why , there it is just at the top , you little noodles !</stage>
   <stage>R .— Oh , so it is , I had n't seen it .</stage>
   <stage>J .— Nor had I .</stage>
   <stage>R .— Thank you so much , Mammy . ( She goes back to her writing . To JANET . ) Now , we must have our own cups and saucers out of the toy cupboard .</stage>
   <stage>( They open the toy cupboard , and they both sit down on the ground . JANET takes out a trumpet and RALPH a drum . They blow the trumpet and beat the drum . )</stage>
   <stage>M .— ( Looking round . ) My dear children , is that how you are laying the table ?</stage>
   <stage>R .— Oh , Mammy , I am so sorry ! I forgot we were getting out our cups and saucers . ( RALPH takes out cups and saucers and gives them to JANET . ) Here they are , three cups and three saucers .</stage>
   <stage>J .— Now I 'm Susan !</stage>
   <stage>( JANET arranges the cups and saucers close together at one side of the table . )</stage>
   <stage>R .— You stupid girl , that is not how they ought to be arranged . Susan always put them quite apart from each other , and the tea-pot at one end of the table like this .</stage>
   <stage>J .— Do let me have the tea-pot in front of me .</stage>
   <stage>R .— Certainly not , it must be in front of me .</stage>
   <stage>J .— Mammy , do n't you think I ought to have the tea-pot in front of me ? because I am a girl .</stage>
   <stage>R .— No , I 'll have it in front of me , because I am a boy .</stage>
   <stage>M .— Suppose you put it in the middle of the table where you can both reach it . I shall sit at the side like a guest , and you can take turns .</stage>
   <stage>R .— That will be delightful . We will put the tea-pot here , then .</stage>
   <stage>J .— Where is the tea-pot ?</stage>
   <stage>R .— That 's true , yes , we have n't got one of our own . Mammy , what tea-pot are we to have ?</stage>
   <stage>M .— Wo n't you have the one we always have at tea ?</stage>
   <stage>R .— No , it 's too common . It wo n't seem like our own tea-party , then .</stage>
   <stage>J .— I suppose we might n't have one of the beautiful little tea-pots out of the china cupboard , just for once ?</stage>
   <stage>M .— Just for once , you may , if you take care of it .</stage>
   <stage>( RALPH goes out L. Then comes back . )</stage>
   <stage>R .— I am afraid I am not tall enough to reach the cupboard .</stage>
   <stage>J .— You do n't think , I suppose , you could come into the next room and get it for us ?</stage>
   <stage>M .— ( Getting up . ) I daresay I might .</stage>
   <stage>J .— You see it is not our fault if we are not as tall as you , is it ?</stage>
   <stage>M .— Not quite , I daresay .</stage>
   <stage>( She goes out . They watch her through the door . )</stage>
   <stage>R .— Is n't Mammy tall when she stands on a foot-stool !</stage>
   <stage>J .— I mean to be just the same size as Mammy is when I grow up .</stage>
   <stage>R .— That 's just like a girl , to say that sort of stupid thing . You do n't know in the least how tall you will be when you grow up .</stage>
   <stage>J .— Well , if girls are stupid , they are not so rude as boys .</stage>
   <stage>R .— Girls are rude sometimes . It was very rude of you to talk about my dropping the cutlet into my lap .</stage>
   <stage>M .— ( MOTHER coming in with two tea-pots . ) You do n't mean to say you are still discussing that cutlet ! Now , which of the tea-pots is it to be ?</stage>
   <stage>R .— Oh , Mammy , I have such a good idea ! Let 's have them both , one at each end , and then we can both pour out tea .</stage>
   <stage>M .— Very well .</stage>
   <stage>( They put tea-pots on table . They walk round the table looking at them . The MOTHER goes on writing . )</stage>
   <stage>R .— Oh , this is capital . Now , we must get the things to eat . We shall want milk and sugar .</stage>
   <stage>J .— And bread and butter and biscuits .</stage>
   <stage>R .— And jam and cakes , perhaps — because , as it is our own tea-party , it ought to be a grand one .</stage>
   <stage>J .— Of course .</stage>
   <stage>R .— I 've got some sugar that I put in my pocket this morning for the raven .</stage>
   <stage>( Feels in his pocket , and brings out string , knife , etc ., finally four lumps of sugar , one at a time . )</stage>
   <stage>J .— Four lumps , will that be enough ?</stage>
   <stage>R .— I wonder how many Mammy will want . Mammy , do you like your tea very , very sweet ?</stage>
   <stage>M .— No , I do n't like sugar in it at all .</stage>
   <stage>R .— Oh , that 's capital . Now , Janet , we can have two lumps each , one in each cup of tea . You can n't have more . It 's horrid to be greedy , you know .</stage>
   <stage>J .— ( With a sigh . ) Well , I suppose that will have to do .</stage>
   <stage>R .— Now , there 's the milk , we 'll ask the cook for that .</stage>
   <stage>J .— And we shall want some spoons and knives .</stage>
   <stage>R .— Susan will get out those .</stage>
   <stage>J .— I should like to have some toast , too .</stage>
   <stage>R .— We 'll ask nurse to make that , they make such nice toast in the nursery .</stage>
   <stage>J .— And then the biscuits .</stage>
   <stage>R .— And the jam . We must ask Mammy what we may have . Mammy !</stage>
   <stage>M .— What is it now ?</stage>
   <stage>R .— We may have some biscuits and some cakes , as well as bread and butter , may n't we ?</stage>
   <stage>M .— Oh yes , you may look in the dining-room cupboard for what you want , if you do n't take too much .</stage>
   <stage>R .— Oh , how delightful ! Come , Janet .</stage>
   <stage>M .— ( Alone . ) Perhaps in the meantime I shall be able to add up my accounts !</stage>
   <stage>( Writes intently . After a minute the children burst in again , carrying spoons , and knives , and plates . )</stage>
   <stage>R .— Oh , Mammy , there are such a lot of things in the dining-room cupboard , we do n't know which to choose .</stage>
   <stage>J .— I wish you would come and help us .</stage>
   <stage>R .— I suppose you 're too busy , are n't you ?</stage>
   <stage>M .— Oh , I daresay I can manage it . ( Gets up . )</stage>
   <stage>R .— ( Who is laying the table . ) You know really , Mammy , the best thing would be that you should look into the dining-room cupboard , while Janet and I finish the table ; we are so very busy , you see .</stage>
   <stage>M .— ( Smiling . ) I will go and look in the cupboard and see what I can find . ( Exit MOTHER . )</stage>
   <stage>R .— Now , this is getting on splendidly , is n't it Janet ? Let me see , have we remembered everything ?</stage>
   <stage>J .— I think so . The cook is making the tea and getting the milk .</stage>
   <stage>R .— Susan is cutting the bread and butter .</stage>
   <stage>J .— Nurse is making the toast .</stage>
   <stage>R .— Mammy is choosing the cakes and the jam . I must say I do feel proud of doing it all by ourselves , without giving anybody extra trouble .</stage>
   <stage>J .— Yes , it makes me feel as if we were such good children .</stage>
   <stage>R .— So it does me .</stage>
   <stage>J .— I should like to feel like this every day .</stage>
   <stage>R .— Oh , I think one would soon get tired of it , you know . Oh , here comes Mammy ! ( They both run up to her as she comes in . ) Well , Mammy , well ?</stage>
   <stage>M .— Well , you had better go into the dining-room and see if you approve of my choice .</stage>
   <stage>R .— Oh , thank you . Now we must have some plates to put the cakes upon .</stage>
   <stage>J .— Mammy , may we just for once have those beautiful little plates out of the china cupboard ?</stage>
   <stage>M .— Just for once then , if you take good care of them .</stage>
   <stage>R .— Then , Mammy , I think you had better get them out for fear we should break them .</stage>
   <stage>M .— Very well , let 's go and get them .</stage>
   <stage>( She gives a hand to each . )</stage>
   <stage>J .— Oh , are you not pleased with us for arranging our tea-party all by ourselves ! ( They go out . )</stage>
   <p>CURTAIN .</p>
   <p>THE BEST CHILDREN IN THE WORLD .</p>
   <p>CHARACTERS .</p>
   <stage>MRS. MONTGOMERY . HARRY . PHŒBE .</stage>
   <p>THE BEST CHILDREN IN THE WORLD .</p>
   <stage>MRS . MONTGOMERY .— ( With her bonnet on , putting on her gloves , etc . HARRY and PHŒBE playing on the floor . ) Good-bye , my children , I shall be back soon . ( HARRY and PHŒBE get up . )</stage>
   <stage>HARRY .— Where are you going , Mammy ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. M .— Only to pay two visits .</stage>
   <stage>PHŒBE .— How long will that take ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. M .— About three-quarters of an hour , if the people are at home .</stage>
   <stage>P .— You would be very sorry if they were n't at home , would n't you ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. M .— Oh , of course .</stage>
   <stage>H .— What stupid questions Phœbe asks , does n't she !</stage>
   <stage>MRS. M .— Well , never mind , everybody is stupid sometimes . What are you going to do while I am away ?</stage>
   <stage>H .— We are going to play , I suppose .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. M .— Had n't you better go to the nursery then ?</stage>
   <stage>H .— Oh no , Mammy ! it 's so babyish to stay in the nursery ! It 's much nicer to stay in the drawing-room by ourselves , as if we were you and Pappy .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. M .— Only Pappy and I do n't get into mischief when we are left in the drawing-room .</stage>
   <stage>H .— We wo n't either . You tell us what we must n't do in here , and we will be the best children in the world .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. M .— Well , now , let me see : you are not to have a pillow fight with the sofa cushions .</stage>
   <stage>H .— Of course not .</stage>
   <stage>P .— What an idea !</stage>
   <stage>MRS. M .— You are not to play with my reels of cotton , or to throw them about .</stage>
   <stage>P .— Certainly not .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. M .— You are not to build houses with the books , or to drop them on the ground .</stage>
   <stage>H .— No , we wo n't .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. M .— And , above all , you are not to touch that box .</stage>
   <stage>H .— Why must n't we touch that box ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. M .— Never you mind that .</stage>
   <stage>H .— Oh Mammy ! is it a great secret ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. M .— Perhaps it is . Now , mind you remember all I 've told you .</stage>
   <stage>H .— Of course we will . Good-bye , dear Mammy . ( They kiss . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. M .— Good-bye .</stage>
   <stage>P .— Look at us out of the window . ( They go and stand at the window and wave their handkerchiefs . )</stage>
   <stage>H .— ( Turning from the window . ) Now , what shall we do ?</stage>
   <stage>P .— I think it 's rather dull staying in the drawing-room . Let 's go into the nursery .</stage>
   <stage>H .— No , that 's so babyish — you talk as if we were little children . Let us stay here , and do exactly what Pappy and Mammy do .</stage>
   <stage>P .— Very well — I 'll sit here and work , and you sit in that chair with your legs crossed , and read the newspaper to me .</stage>
   <stage>HARRY sits and crosses his legs , takes a newspaper .</stage>
   <stage>P .— I wish I had some work to do . I wonder if I may do some of Mammy 's ?</stage>
   <stage>H .— I should think so . She did n't say anything about her work , she only said you were n't to play with the reels of cotton , you know .</stage>
   <stage>P .— Well , of course , I sha n't do that . ( Takes a piece of embroidery . ) Oh dear , I 've unthreaded the needle ! I shall never be able to work with this thick thread , I must get a finer reel . ( Gets out two or three reels which she puts in her lap . Tries to thread the needle . )</stage>
   <stage>H .— Now , I 'll tell you what , I 'll read out loud just as Pappy does . ( Begins to read . ) “ The threatening aspect of the political outlook has undergone no recent modification — ” what on earth does that mean ?</stage>
   <stage>P .— I do n't know in the least what modication means .</stage>
   <stage>H .— It is n't modication , you stupid ! mod-i-fi-cation .</stage>
   <stage>P .— Well , what 's the difference ?</stage>
   <stage>H .— How should I know ?</stage>
   <stage>P .— Then you are as stupid as I am .</stage>
   <stage>H .— No , I am not . Boys are never as stupid as girls . But I 'll look it out in the dictionary .</stage>
   <stage>( Puts a sofa cushion on a chair and stands on it to get down the dictionary . Jumps down and knocks down chair , and falls down with books . )</stage>
   <stage>P .— Great clumsy creature you are !</stage>
   <stage>H .— You are not to call me names .</stage>
   <stage>( Throws the sofa cushion at her . )</stage>
   <stage>P .— Naughty boy !</stage>
   <stage>( Jumps up , reels fall off her lap , and picks up the cushion . He tries to drag it away from her . While struggling , they knock over the box their mother told them not to touch . It drops . It is full of sugar plums . They are all spilt on the ground . )</stage>
   <stage>H .— Now look what you 've done !</stage>
   <stage>P .— Sugar plums !</stage>
   <stage>H .— That 's the box Mammy told us not to touch .</stage>
   <stage>P .— We must pick them up as quickly as possible , and put them in again .</stage>
   <stage>( They begin putting them in again . )</stage>
   <stage>H .— I wonder whether they are really sugar plums ?</stage>
   <stage>P .— I 'll tell you what . Let 's lick the outside of one and see if it 's sweet .</stage>
   <stage>H .— ( Licks it . ) Yes , they are sugar plums .</stage>
   <stage>P .— ( Licking one . ) Are you quite sure ?</stage>
   <stage>H .— Yes , I think so . I 'll just lick it again to be quite certain . Oh yes , they are sugar plums , there 's not a doubt . ( They put them into the box . )</stage>
   <stage>P .— I think it 's rather horrid to put them back into the box again after we have licked them .</stage>
   <stage>H .— I think it is . Let us take out the ones we licked , and eat them . That will be cleaner , wo n't it ?</stage>
   <stage>P .— But they are all mixed ! I do n't know which they are now !</stage>
   <stage>H .— Oh , you are a stupid girl ! Well , we must eat all that are in the box , there is no help for it .</stage>
   <stage>P .— I really think that would be the safest plan .</stage>
   <stage>( Their mother comes in while they are sitting on the floor eating the sugar plums . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. M .— I 've come back for my card-case which I have forgotten . Why , what have you been doing ? Oh , Harry ! Oh , Phœbe ! I thought you were going to be so good !</stage>
   <stage>P .— So we were ! We were trying to be very , very good .</stage>
   <stage>H .— Awfully good .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. M .— Good , indeed ! I told you not to play with my work-basket , or the books , or the sofa cushions , or that box , and you have disobeyed me in everything ! My reels are on the floor , my books on the floor , the sofa cushion on the floor , the box that I particularly asked you not to touch upset and emptied ! I must say I think you have been very naughty .</stage>
   <stage>H .— Dear Mammy , I am so sorry ! We really did n't mean to play with any of the things . We were going to be like you and Pappy . So I began to read the paper to Phœbe .</stage>
   <stage>P .— While I did your work .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. M .— ( Horrified . ) My work !</stage>
   <stage>H .— And , then , because I did n't understand what we were reading about , I got a dictionary to look out the words , and I dropped it , and Phœbe said I was clumsy .</stage>
   <stage>P .— So then he threw a sofa cushion at me .</stage>
   <stage>H .— Only because she called me names , you know . It was n't a pillow fight in the least .</stage>
   <stage>P .— And I jumped up , and the reels rolled off my lap , and I tried to take the cushion away from him , and somehow we knocked over the box .</stage>
   <stage>H .— But we did n't mean to in the very least . It was quite by accident .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. M .— Then , how did those sugar plums get into your mouths ? That was by accident too I suppose .</stage>
   <stage>H .— No , that was because we thought it was so dirty to put back the sugar plums we had licked .</stage>
   <stage>P .— We just licked them to make sure they were sugar plums .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. M .— I see . Well , those sugar plums were for you . Your uncle sent them , and I was going to give them to you this evening , but now I shall throw them away instead .</stage>
   <stage>H .— Throw them away ! Oh , Mammy , what a pity !</stage>
   <stage>MRS. M .— Yes , it is a pity I can n't trust two children of six and seven years old in a room by themselves . Come , let me see you safely in the nursery before I go out again .</stage>
   <stage>P .— It is a pity , just when we were trying to be the best children in the world ! ( They go out . )</stage>

He was an enchanter , I suppose , or a fairy of some kind . Why did n't he say so at once ? Then I might have given him a piece of chicken . Well , it 's too late now , I suppose . Perhaps I had better cut some wood , there 's nothing else to do . There 's a tree that would be easy enough .<stage>Goes out R. carrying his axe over his shoulder .

    <sp>
     <speaker>L</speaker>

     <p>— I was sure of it — a fit abode for so ethereal a being as yourself . You were nourished , I feel sure , on no mortal food — your dainty , beautiful clothes were woven by no mortal hands — they were spun by elves and fairies in some enchanted , far-away spot .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>M</speaker>
     <p>—<stage>Eagerly .</stage>What a singular thing ! Now you mention it , one of my daughters lost a shoe — indeed , they both did .</p>

    </sp>
    <stage>LUCY hobbles round the room , limping violently .</stage>
    <sp>

     <p>— Oh , there is no doubt , your highness , that that is hers .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>P</speaker>
     <p>— Did n't I notice a slight limp as she walked ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>M</speaker>

     <p>— Your heel is quite out of it still .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAB</speaker>
     <p>— That is how I always wear my shoes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>M</speaker>
     <p>— That is what gives her such a springy , graceful walk .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MABEL tries to walk round the room , clattering the shoe behind her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>P</speaker>

     <p>—<stage>To the MOTHER .</stage>Are there no more young girls in this house , whom the shoe would be likely to fit ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>M</speaker>
     <p>— Alas , these two fair ones are my only joys .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>P</speaker>
     <p>— Yet , I thought , as I passed the window , I saw another .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>M</speaker>
     <p>— Oh , your highness , I beg your pardon — that was only our scullion , looking out to see you . Naughty thing !</p>

     <speaker>P</speaker>
     <p>— Nay , no one shall kneel here but me .<stage>Kneels in front of CINDERELLA , who puts on the shoe without difficulty .</stage>There , I think , is the foot it fits , there is no doubt about that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>M</speaker>
     <p>— I fear your highness is being imposed upon — that shoe could never have belonged to that ragged Cinderella .</p>
    </sp>
