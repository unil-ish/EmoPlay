    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">These five plays were written , in the order in which they appear now , during the years 1916 and 1917 . They would hardly have been written had it not been for the war , although only one of them is concerned with that subject . To his other responsibilities the Kaiser now adds this volume .</p>
    <p n="2">For these plays were not the work of a professional writer , but the recreation of a ( temporary ) professional soldier . Play-writing is a luxury to a journalist , as insidious as golf and much more expensive in time and money . When an article is written , the financial reward ( and we may as well live as not ) is a matter of certainty . A novelist , too , even if he is not in “ the front rank ” — but I never heard of one who was n't — can at least be sure of publication . But when a play is written , there is no certainty of anything save disillusionment .</p>
    <p n="3">To write a play , then , while I was a journalist seemed to me a depraved proceeding , almost as bad as going to Lord 's in the morning . I thought I could write one ( we all think we can ) , but I could not afford so unpromising a gamble . But once in the Army the case was altered . No duty now urged me to write . My job was soldiering , and my spare time was my own affair . Other subalterns played bridge and golf ; that was one way of amusing oneself . Another way was — why not ?— to write plays .</p>
    <p n="4">So we began with Wurzel-Flummery . I say “ we , ” because another is mixed up in this business even more seriously than the Kaiser . She wrote ; I dictated . And if a particularly fine evening drew us out for a walk along the byways — where there was no saluting , and one could smoke a pipe without shocking the Duke of Cambridge — then it was to discuss the last scene and to wonder what would happen in the next . We did not estimate the money or publicity which might come from this new venture ; there has never been any serious thought of making money by my bridge-playing , nor desire for publicity when I am trying to play golf . But secretly , of course , we hoped . It was that which made it so much more exciting than any other game .</p>
    <p n="5">Our hopes were realized to the following extent :</p>
    <p n="6">Wurzel-Flummery was produced by Mr. Dion Boucicault at the New Theatre in April , 1917 . It was originally written in three acts , in which form it was shown to one or two managers . At the beginning of 1917 I was offered the chance of production in a triple bill if I cut it down into a two-act play . To cut even a line is painful , but to cut thirty pages of one 's first comedy , slaughtering whole characters on the way , has at least a certain morbid fascination . It appeared , therefore , in two acts ; and one kindly critic embarrassed us by saying that a lesser artist would have written it in three acts , and most of the other critics annoyed us by saying that a greater artist would have written it in one act . However , I amused myself some months later by slaying another character — the office-boy , no less — thereby getting it down to one act , and was surprised to find that the one-act version was , after all , the best ... At least I think it is .... At any rate , that is the version I am printing here ; but , as can be imagined , I am rather tired of the whole business by now , and I am beginning to wonder if anyone ever did take the name of Wurzel-Flummery at all . Probably the whole thing is an invention .</p>
    <p n="7">The Lucky One was doomed from the start with a name like that . And the girl marries the wrong man . I see no hope of its being produced . But if any critic wishes to endear himself to me ( though I do n't see why he should ) he will agree with me that it is the best play of the five .</p>
    <p n="8">The Boy Comes Home was produced by Mr. Owen Nares at the Victoria Palace in September , 1918 , introduced afterwards into Hallo , America ! at the Palace , and played by Mr. Godfrey Tearle at the Coliseum in the following April .</p>
    <p n="9">Belinda was produced by Mr. Dion Boucicault at the New Theatre in April , 1918 , with Miss Irene Vanbrugh in the name-part . Miss Ethel Barrymore played it in New York . I hope it will read pleasantly , but I am quite incapable of judging it , for every speech of Belinda 's comes to me now in Miss Vanbrugh 's voice .</p>
    <p n="10">The Red Feathers has not yet been produced , one reason being ( perhaps ) that it has never been offered to anybody . It is difficult enough to find a manager , but when one has also to get hold of a composer , the business of production becomes terrifying . I suppose there is a way of negotiating these difficulties , but I suspect that most of the fun to be got out of this operetta we have already had in writing it .</p>
    <p n="11">In conclusion , I must distress my friend J. M. Barrie ( who gave me a first chance ) by acknowledging my great debt to him . It would be more polite to leave him out of it , but I cannot let him off . After all , these are only “ First Plays . ” I can always hope that “ Last Plays ” will be more worthy of that early encouragement .</p>

    <castItem>
     <role>[ It is a June day before the war in the morning-room of ROBERT CRAWSHAW 'S town house . Entering it with our friend the house-agent , our attention would first be called to the delightful club fender round the fireplace . On one side of this a Chesterfield sofa comes out at right angles . In a corner of the sofa MISS VIOLA CRAWSHAW is sitting , deep in “ The Times . ” The house-agent would hesitate to catalogue her , but we notice for ourselves , before he points out the comfortable armchair opposite , that she is young and pretty . In the middle of the room and facing the fireplace is</role>
     <roleDesc>observe ) a solid knee-hole writing-table , covered with papers and books of reference , and supported by a chair at the middle and another at the side . The rest of the furniture , and the books and pictures round the walls , we must leave until another time , for at this moment the door behind the sofa opens and RICHARD MERITON comes in . He looks about thirty-five , has a clean-shaven intelligent face , and is dressed in a dark tweed suit . We withdraw hastily , as he comes behind VIOLA and puts his hands over her eyes . ]</roleDesc>

    <castItem>
     <role>RICHARD . N-no</role>
     <roleDesc>I suppose not . Not just after breakfast anyway . Anything in the paper ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>VIOLA</role>
     <roleDesc>There 's a letter from father pointing out that —</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>RICHARD . I</role>
     <roleDesc>never knew such a man as Robert for pointing out</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>VIOLA . Anyhow</role>
     <roleDesc>it 's in big print</roleDesc>

     <role>RICHARD</role>
     <roleDesc>It would be</roleDesc>

    <castItem>
     <role>VIOLA . You are very cynical this morning</role>
     <roleDesc>Dick</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>RICHARD . The sausages were cold</role>
     <roleDesc>dear</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>VIOLA . Poor Dick ! Oh</role>
     <roleDesc>Dick , I wish you were on the same side as father</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>RICHARD . But he 's on the wrong side . Surely I 've told you that before .... Viola</role>
     <roleDesc>do you really think it would make a difference ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>VIOLA . Well</role>
     <roleDesc>you know what he said about you at Basingstoke the other day</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>RICHARD . No</role>
     <roleDesc>I do n't , really</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>VIOLA . He said that your intellectual arrogance was only equalled by your spiritual instability . I do n't quite know what it means</role>
     <roleDesc>but it does n't sound the sort of thing you want in a son-in-law</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>RICHARD . Still</role>
     <roleDesc>it was friendly of him to go right away to Basingstoke to say it . Anyhow , you do n't believe it</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>VIOLA</role>
     <roleDesc>Of course not</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>RICHARD</role>
     <roleDesc>And Robert does n't really</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>VIOLA</role>
     <roleDesc>Then why does he say it ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>RICHARD . Ah , now you 're opening up very grave questions . The whole structure of the British Constitution rests upon Robert 's right to say things like that at Basingstoke .... But really , darling , we 're very good friends . He 's always asking my advice about things — he does n't take it , of course , but still he asks it ; and it awfully good of him to insist on my staying here while my flat was being done up</role>
     <roleDesc>Seriously ) I bless him for that . If it had n't been for the last week I should never have known you . You were just “ Viola ” — the girl I 'd seen at odd times since she was a child ; now — oh , why wo n't you let me tell your father ? I hate it like this</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>VIOLA , Because I love you , Dick , and because I know father . He would , as they say in novels , show you the door</role>
     <roleDesc>Smiling ) And I want you this side of the door for a little bit longer</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>RICHARD</role>
     <roleDesc>firmly ) . I shall tell him before I go</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>VIOLA</role>
     <roleDesc>pleadingly ) . But not till then ; that gives us two more days . You see , darling , it 's going to take me all I know to get round him . You see , apart from politics you 're so poor — and father hates poor people</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>RICHARD</role>
     <roleDesc>viciously ) . Damn money !</roleDesc>

     <role>VIOLA</role>

    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>RICHARD . Viola !</role>
     <roleDesc>He stands up and holds out his arms to her . She goes to him and —) Oh , Lord , look out !</roleDesc>

     <roleDesc>reaching across to the mantelpiece ) . Matches ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>RICHARD . Thanks very much</role>
     <roleDesc>He lights his pipe as ROBERT CRAWSHAW comes in . )( CRAWSHAW is forty-five , but his closely-trimmed moustache and whiskers , his inclination to stoutness , and the loud old-gentlemanly style in trousers which he affects with his morning-coat , make him look older , and , what is more important , the Pillar of the State which he undoubtedly is</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>CRAWSHAW . Good-morning</role>
     <roleDesc>Richard . Down at last ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>

     <role>RICHARD . Good morning . I did warn you</role>
     <roleDesc>did n't I , that I was bad at breakfasts ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>CRAWSHAW . Viola</role>

    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>CRAWSHAW . I</role>
     <roleDesc>wish to speak to her</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>VIOLA . All right , I 'll tell her . [ She goes out . ]</role>
     <roleDesc>RICHARD Picks up “ The Times ” and sits down again</roleDesc>

    <castItem>
     <role>CRAWSHAW</role>

    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>RICHARD . My dear fellow</role>
     <roleDesc>I 've only just finished breakfast</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>CRAWSHAW . I mean generally . And apart</role>
     <roleDesc>of course , from your — ah — work in the House</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>RICHARD</role>
     <roleDesc>a trifle cool ) . I have something to do</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>CRAWSHAW . Oh</role>
     <roleDesc>reviewing . I mean something serious . You should get a directorship or something in the City</roleDesc>

    <castItem>
     <role>RICHARD . I</role>
     <roleDesc>hate the City</roleDesc>

     <role>CRAWSHAW . Ah ! there</role>
     <roleDesc>my dear Richard , is that intellectual arrogance to which I had to call attention the other day at Basingstoke</roleDesc>

    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>CRAWSHAW . You understood , my dear fellow , that I meant nothing personal .</role>
     <roleDesc>Clearing his throat ) It is justly one of the proudest boasts of the Englishman that his political enmities are not allowed to interfere with his private friendships</roleDesc>

     <roleDesc>Yes , dear , did n't I say that ? I am sure you could talk the solicitor round — this Mr. Denis Clifton . After all , it does n't matter to him what we call ourselves . Write him one of your letters , dear</roleDesc>

     <roleDesc>well , never mind</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>MARGARET</role>
     <roleDesc>Yes , well , you tell the solicitor that you will take the fifty thousand pounds , but you do n't want the name . It 's too absurd , when everybody knows of Robert Crawshaw , M. P ., to expect you to call yourself Wurzley-Fothergill</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>CRAWSHAW</role>
     <roleDesc>impatiently ) . Yes , yes . The point is that this Mr. Clifton has left me the money on condition that I change my name . If I do n't take the name , I do n't take the money</roleDesc>

     <role>MARGARET</role>
     <roleDesc>But is that legal ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>CRAWSHAW</role>
     <roleDesc>Perfectly . It is often done . People change their names on succeeding to some property</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>MARGARET . I</role>
     <roleDesc>thought it was only when your name was Moses and you changed it to Talbot</roleDesc>

    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>MARGARET . I wonder why he left you the money at all . Of course it was very nice of him</role>
     <roleDesc>but if you did n't know him — Why do you think he did , dear ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>CRAWSHAW . I</role>
     <roleDesc>know no more than this letter . I suppose he had — ah — followed my career , and was — ah — interested in it , and being a man with no relations , felt that he could — ah — safely leave this money to me . No doubt Wurzel-Flummery was his mother 's maiden name , or the name of some other friend even dearer to him ; he wished the name — ah — perpetuated , perhaps even recorded not unworthily in the history of our country , and — ah — made this will accordingly . In a way it is a kind of — ah — sacred trust</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>MARGARET</role>
     <roleDesc>Then , of course , you 'll accept it , dear ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>CRAWSHAW . It requires some consideration . I have my career to think about</role>
     <roleDesc>my duty to my country</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>MARGARET . Of course</role>
     <roleDesc>dear . Money is a great help in politics , is n't it ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>CRAWSHAW . Money wisely spent is a help in any profession . The view of riches which socialists and suchlike people profess to take is entirely ill-considered . A rich man</role>
     <roleDesc>who spends his money thoughtfully , is serving his country as nobly as anybody</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>MARGARET . Yes</role>
     <roleDesc>dear . Then you think we could have that second car and the house in Curzon Street ?</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>CRAWSHAW . We must not be led away . Fifty thousand pounds</role>
     <roleDesc>properly invested , is only two thousand a year . When you have deducted the income-tax — and the tax on unearned income is extremely high just now —</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>MARGARET . Oh</role>
     <roleDesc>but surely if we have to call ourselves Wurzel-Flummery it would count as earned income</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>CRAWSHAW . I fear not . Strictly speaking</role>
     <roleDesc>all money is earned . Even if it is left to you by another , it is presumably left to you in recognition of certain outstanding qualities which you possess . But Parliament takes a different view . I do not for a moment say that fifty thousand pounds would not be welcome . Fifty pounds is certainly not to be sneezed at —</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>MARGARET . I should think not</role>
     <roleDesc>indeed !</roleDesc>

     <roleDesc>unconsciously rising from his chair ) . And without this preposterous condition attached I should be pleased to accept this trust , and I would endeavour , Mr. Speaker — ( He sits down again suddenly . ) I would , Margaret , to , carry it out to the best of my poor ability . But — Wurtzel-Flummery !</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>MARGARET . You would soon get used to it</role>
     <roleDesc>dear . I had to get used to the name of Crawshaw after I had been Debenham for twenty-five years . It is surprising how quickly it comes to you . I think I only signed my name Margaret Debenham once after I was married</roleDesc>

     <role>CRAWSHAW</role>
     <roleDesc>kindly ) . The cases are rather different , Margaret . Naturally a woman , who from her cradle looks forward to the day when she will change her name , cannot have this feeling for the — ah — honour of his name , which every man — ah — feels . Such a feeling is naturally more present in my own case since I have been privileged to make the name of Crawshaw in some degree — ah — well-known , I might almost say famous</roleDesc>

    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>MARGARET . Anyhow</role>
     <roleDesc>dear , let us look on the bright side . Fifty thousand pounds is fifty thousand pounds</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>CRAWSHAW</role>
     <roleDesc>It is , Margaret . And no doubt it is my duty to accept it . But — well , all I say is that a gentleman would have left it without any conditions . Or at least he would merely have expressed his wish that I should take the name , without going so far as to enforce it . Then I could have looked at the matter all round in an impartial spirit</roleDesc>

     <role>CRAWSHAW . What ? Oh — yes , there will be a good deal of that to attend to .</role>

    <docImprint>( CRAWSHAW goes to his desk and selects a “ Who 's Who ” from a little pile of reference-books on it . He walks round to his chair , sits down in it and begins to turn the pages , murmuring names beginning with “ C ” to himself as he gets near the place . When he finds it , he murmurs “ Clifton — that 's funny , ” and closes the book . Evidently the publishers have failed him . ) [ Enter RICHARD . ] RICHARD . Well , what 's the news ? ( He goes to his old seat on the fender . ) Been left a fortune ? CRAWSHAW ( simply ) . Yes .... By a Mr. Antony Clifton . I never met him and I know nothing about him . RICHARD ( surprised ) . Not really ? Well , I congratulate you . ( He sighs . ) To them that hath — But what on earth do you want my advice about ? CRAWSHAW . There is a slight condition attached . RICHARD . Oho ! CRAWSHAW . The condition is that with this money — fifty thousand pounds — I take the name of — ah — Wurzel-Flummery . RICHARD ( jumping up ) . What ! CRAWSHAW ( sulkily ) . I said it quite distinctly — Wurzel-Flummery . ( RICHARD in an awed silence walks over to the desk and stands looking down at the unhappy CRAWSHAW . He throws out his left hand as if introducing him . ) RICHARD ( reverently ) . Mr. Robert Wurzel-Flummery , M. P ., one of the most prominent of our younger Parliamentarians . Oh , you ... oh !... oh , how too heavenly ! ( He goes back to his seat , looks up and catches CRAWSHAW 'S eye , and breaks down altogether . ) CRAWSHAW ( rising with dignity ) . Shall we discuss it seriously , or shall we leave it ? RICHARD . How can we discuss a name like Wurzel-Flummery seriously ? “ Mr. Wurzel-Flummery in a few well-chosen words seconded the motion . ” ... “ ‘ Sir , ’ went on Mr. Wurzel-Flummery ” — Oh , poor Robert ! CRAWSHAW ( sitting down sulkily ) . You seem quite certain that I shall take the money . RICHARD . I am quite certain . CRAWSHAW . Would you take it ? RICHARD ( hesitating ) . Well — I wonder . CRAWSHAW . After all , as William Shakespeare says , “ What 's in a name ? ” RICHARD . I can tell you something else that Shakespeare — William Shakespeare — said . ( Dramatically rising ) Who steals my purse with fifty thousand in it — steals trash . ( In his natural voice ) Trash , Robert : ( Dramatically again ) But he who filches from me my good name of Crawshaw ( lightly ) and substitutes the rotten one of Wurzel — CRAWSHAW ( annoyed ) . As a matter of fact , Wurzel-Flummery is a very good old name . I seem to remember some — ah — Hampshire Wurzel-Flummeries . It is a very laudable spirit on the part of a dying man to wish to — ah — perpetuate these old English names . It all seems to me quite natural and straightforward . If I take this money I shall have nothing to be ashamed of . RICHARD . I see .... Look here , may I ask you a few questions ? I should like to know just how you feel about the whole business ? CRAWSHAW ( complacently folding his hands ) . Go ahead . RICHARD . Suppose a stranger came up in the street to you and said , “ My poor man , here 's five pounds for you , ” what would you do ? Tell him to go to the devil , I suppose , would n't you ? CRAWSHAW ( humorously ) . In more parliamentary language , perhaps , Richard . I should tell him I never took money from strangers . RICHARD . Quite so ; but that if it were ten thousand pounds , you would take it ? CRAWSHAW . I most certainly should n't . RICHARD . But if he died and left it to you , then you would ? CRAWSHAW ( blandly ) . Ah , I thought you were leading up to that . That , of course , is entirely different . RICHARD . Why ? CRAWSHAW . Well — ah — would n't you take ten thousand pounds if it were left to you by a stranger ? RICHARD . I daresay I should . But I should like to know why it would seem different . CRAWSHAW ( professionally ) . Ha-hum ! Well — in the first place , when a man is dead he wants his money no longer . You can therefore be certain that you are not taking anything from him which he cannot spare . And in the neat place , it is the man 's dying wish that you should have the money . To refuse would be to refuse the dead . To accept becomes almost a sacred duty . RICHARD . It really comes to this , does n't it ? You wo n't take it from him when he 's alive , because if you did , you could n't decently refuse him a little gratitude ; but you know that it does n't matter a damn to him what happens to his money after he 's dead , and therefore you can take it without feeling any gratitude at all . CRAWSHAW . No , I should n't put it like that . RICHARD ( smiling ) . I 'm sure you would n't , Robert . CRAWSHAW No doubt you can twist it about so that — RICHARD . All right , we 'll leave that and go on to the next point . Suppose a perfect stranger offered you five pounds to part your hair down the middle , shave off your moustache , and wear only one whisker — if he met you suddenly in the street , seemed to dislike your appearance , took out a fiver and begged you to hurry off and alter yourself — of course you 'd pocket the money and go straight to your barber 's ? CRAWSHAW . Now you are merely being offensive . RICHARD . I beg your pardon . I should have said that if he had left you five pounds in his will ?— well , then twenty pounds ? a hundred pounds ?— a thousand pounds ?— fifty thousand pounds ?— ( Jumping up excitedly ) It 's only a question of price — fifty thousand pounds , Robert — a pink tie with purple spots , hair across the back , trousers with a patch in the fall myself Wurzel-Flummery — any old thing you like , you can n't insult me — anything you like , gentlemen , for fifty thousand pounds . ( Lowering his voice ) Only you must leave it in your will , and then I can feel that it is a sacred duty — a sacred duty , my lords and gentlemen . ( He sinks back into the sofa and relights his pipe . ) CRAWSHAW . ( rising with dignity ) . It is evidently useless to prolong this conversation . RICHARD ( waving him dorm again ) . No , no , Robert ; I 've finished . I just took the other side — and I got carried away . I ought to have been at the Bar . CRAWSHAW . You take such extraordinary views of things . You must look facts in the face , Richard . This is a modern world , and we are modern people living in it . Take the matter-of-fact view . You may like or dislike the name of — ah — Wurzel-Flummery , but you can n't get away from the fact that fifty thousand pounds is not to be sneezed at . RICHARD ( wistfully ) . I do n't know why people should n't sneeze at money sometimes . I should like to start a society for sneezing at fifty thousand pounds . We 'd have to begin in a small way , of course ; we 'd begin by sneezing at five pounds — and work up . The trouble is that we 're all inoculated in our cradles against that kind of cold . CRAWSHAW ( pleasantly ) . You will have your little joke . But you know as well as I do that it is only a joke . There can be no serious reason why I should not take this money . And I — ah — gather that you do n't think it will affect my career ? RICHARD ( carelessly ) . Not a bit . It 'll help it . It 'll get you into all the comic papers . [ MARGARET comes in at this moment , to the relief of CRAWSHAW , who is not quite certain if he is being flattered or insulted again . ] MARGARET . Well , have you told him ? RICHARD ( making way for her on the sofa ) . I have heard the news , Mrs. Crawshaw . And I have told Robert my opinion that he should have no difficulty in making the name of Wurzel-Flummery as famous as he has already made that of Crawshaw . At any rate I hope he will . MARGARET . How nice of you ! CRAWSHAW . Well , it 's settled , then . ( Looking at his watch ) This solicitor fellow should be here soon . Perhaps , after all , we can manage something about — Ah , Viola , did you want your mother ? [ Enter VIOLA . ] VIOLA . Sorry , do I interrupt a family meeting ? There 's Richard , so it can n't be very serious . RICHARD . What a reputation ! CRAWSHAW . Well , it 's over now . MARGARET . Viola had better know , had n't she ? CRAWSHAW . She 'll have to know some time , of course . VIOLA ( sitting done firmly on the sofa ) . Of course she will . So you 'd better tell her now . I knew there was something exciting going on this morning . CRAWSHAW ( embarrassed ) . Hum — ha — ( To MARGARET ) Perhaps you 'd better tell her , dear . MARGARET ( simply and naturally ) . Father has come into some property , Viola . It means changing our name unfortunately . But your father does n't think it will matter . VIOLA . How thrilling ! What is the name , mother ? MARGARET . Your father says it is — dear me , I shall never remember it . CRAWSHAW ( mumbling ) . Wurzel-Flummery . VIOLA ( after a pause ) . Dick , you tell me , if nobody else will . RICHARD . Robert said it just now . VIOLA . That was n't a name , was it ? I thought it was just a — do say it again , father . CRAWSHAW ( sulkily but plainly ) . Wurzel-Flummery . VIOLA ( surprised ) . Do you spell it like that ? I mean like a wurzel and like flummery ? RICHARD . Exactly , I believe . VIOLA ( to herself ) . Miss Viola Wurzel-Flummery — I mean they 'd have to look at you , would n't they ? ( Bubbling over ) Oh , Dick , what a heavenly name ! Who had it first ? RICHARD . They are an old Hampshire family — that is so , is n't it , Robert ? CRAWSHAW ( annoyed ) . I said I thought that I remembered — Margaret , can you find Burke there ? ( She finds it , and he buries himself in the families of the great . ) MARGARET . Well , Viola , you have n't told us how you like being Miss Wurzel-Flummery . VIOLA . I have n't realized myself yet , mummy . I shall have to stand in front of my glass and tell myself who I am . RICHARD . It 's all right for you . You know you 'll change your name one day , and then it wo n't matter what you 've been called before . VIOLA ( secretly ) . H'sh ! ( She smiles lovingly at him , and then says aloud ) Oh , wo n't it ? It 's got to appear in the papers , “ A marriage has been arranged between Miss Viola Wurzel-Flummery ... ” and everybody will say , “ And about time too , poor girl . ” MARGARET ( to CRAWSHAW ) . Have you found it , dear ? CRAWSHAW ( resentfully ) . This is the<date>1912</date>edition . MARGARET . Still , dear , if it 's a very old family , it ought to be in by then . VIOLA . I do n't mind how old it is ; I think it 's lovely . Oh , Dick , what fun it will be being announced ! Just think of the footman throwing open the door and saying — MAID ( announcing ) . Mr. Denis Clifton . ( There is a little natural confusion as CLIFTON enters jauntily in his summer suiting with a bundle of papers under his arm . CRAWSHAW goes towards him and shakes hands . ) CRAWSHAW . How do you do , Mr. Clifton ? Very good of you to come . ( Looking doubtfully at his clothes ) Er — it is Mr. Denis Clifton , the solicitor ? CLIFTON ( cheerfully ) . It is . I must apologize for not looking the part more , but my clothes did not arrive from Clarkson 's in time . Very careless of them when they had promised . And my clerk dissuaded me from the side-whiskers which I keep by me for these occasions . CRAWSHAW ( bewildered ) . Ah yes , quite so . But you have — ah — full legal authority to act in this matter ? CLIFTON .. Oh , decidedly . Oh , there 's no question of that . CRAWSHAW ( introducing ) . My wife — and daughter . ( CLIFTON bows gracefully . ) My friend , Mr. Richard Meriton . CLIFTON ( happily ). Dear me ! Mr. Meriton too ! This is quite a situation , as we say in the profession . RICHARD ( amused by him ) . In the legal profession ? CLIFTON . In the theatrical profession . ( Turning to MARGARET ) I am a writer of plays , Mrs. Crawshaw . I am not giving away a professional secret when I tell you that most of the managers in<settlement>London</settlement>have thanked me for submitting my work to them . CRAWSHAW ( firmly ). I understood , Mr. Clifton , that you were the solicitor employed to wind up the affairs of the late Mr. Antony Clifton . CLIFTON . Oh , certainly . Oh , there 's no doubt about my being a solicitor . My clerk , a man of the utmost integrity , not to say probity , would give me a reference . I am in the books ; I belong to the Law Society . But my heart turns elsewhere . Officially I have embraced the profession of a solicitor — ( Frankly , to MRS. CRAWSHAW ) But you know what these official embraces are . MARGARET . I 'm afraid — ( She turns to her husband for assistance . ) CLIFTON ( to RICHARD ) . Unofficially , Mr. Meriton , I am wedded to the Muses . VIOLA . Dick , is n't he lovely ? CRAWSHAW . Quite so . But just for the moment , Mr. Clifton , I take it that we are concerned with legal business . Should I ever wish to produce a play , the case would be different . CLIFTON . Admirably put . Pray regard me entirely as the solicitor for as long as you wish . ( He puts his hat down on a chair with the papers in it , and taking off his gloves , goes on dreamily ) Mr. Denis Clifton was superb as a solicitor . In spite of an indifferent make-up , his manner of taking off his gloves and dropping them into his hat — ( He does so . ) MARGARET ( to CRAWSHAW ) . I think , perhaps , Viola and I — RICHARD ( making a move too ) . We 'll leave you to your business , Robert . CLIFTON ( holding up his hand ) . Just one moment if I may . I have a letter for you , Mr. Meriton . RICHARD ( surprised ) . For me ? CLIFTON . Yes . My clerk , a man of the utmost integrity — oh , but I said that before — he took it round to your rooms this morning , but found only painters and decorators there . ( He is feeling in his pockets and now brings the letter out . ) I brought it along , hoping that Mr. Crawshaw — but of course I never expected anything so delightful as this . ( He hands over the letter with a bow . ) RICHARD . Thanks . ( He puts it in his pocket . ) CLIFTON . Oh , but do read it now , wo n't you ? ( To MR. CRAWSHAW ) One so rarely has an opportunity of being present when one 's own letters are read . I think the habit they have on the stage of reading letters aloud to other is such a very delightful one . ( RICHARD , with a smile and a shrug , has opened his letter while CLIFTON is talking . ) RICHARD . Good Lord ! VIOLA . Dick , what is it ? RICHARD ( reading ) . “ 199 , Lincoln 's Inn Fields . Dear Sir , I have the pleasure to inform you that under the will of the late Mr. Antony Clifton you are a beneficiary to the extent of £ 50 , 000 . ” VIOLA . Dick ! RICHARD . “ A trifling condition is attached — namely , that you should take the name of — Wurzel-Flummery . ” ( CLIFTON , with his hand on his heart , bows gracefully from one to the other of them . ) CRAWSHAW ( annoyed ) . Impossible ! Why should he leave any money to you ? VIOLA . Dick ! How wonderful ! MARGARET ( mildly ) . I do n't remember ever having had a morning quite like this . RICHARD ( angrily ) . Is this a joke , Mr. Clifton ? CLIFTON . Oh , the money is there all right . My clerk , a man of the utmost — RICHARD . Then I refuse it . I 'll have nothing to do with it . I wo n't even argue about it . ( Tearing the letter into bits ) That 's what I think of your money . [ He stalks indignantly from the room . ] VIOLA . Dick ! Oh , but , mother , he must n't . Oh , I must tell him — [ She hurries after him . ] MARGARET ( with dignity ) . Really , Mr. Clifton , I 'm surprised at you . [ She goes out too . ] CLIFTON ( looking round the room ) . And now , Mr. Crawshaw , we are alone . CRAWSHAW . Yes . Well , I think , Mr. Clifton , you have a good deal to explain — CLIFTON . My dear sir , I 'm longing to begin . I have been looking forward to this day for weeks . I spent over an hour this morning dressing for it . ( He takes papers from his hat and moves to the sofa . ) Perhaps I had better begin from the beginning . CRAWSHAW ( interested , indicating the papers ) . The documents in the case ? CLIFTON . Oh dear , no just something to carry in the hand . It makes one look more like a solicitor . ( Reading the title ) “ Watherston v. Towser — in re Great Missenden Canal Company . ” My clerk invents the titles ; it keeps him busy . He is very fond of Towser ; Towser is always coming in . ( Frankly ) You see , Mr. Crawshaw , this is my first real case , and I only got it because Antony Clifton is my uncle . My efforts to introduce a little picturesqueness into the dull formalities of the law do not meet with that response that one would have expected . CRAWSHAW ( looking at his watch ) . Yes . Well , I 'm a busy man , and if you could tell me as shortly as possible why your uncle left this money to me , and apparently to Mr. Meriton too , under these extraordinary conditions , I shall be obliged to you . CLIFTON . Say no more , Mr. Crawshaw ; I look forward to being entirely frank with you . It will be a pleasure . CRAWSHAW . You understand , of course , my position . I think I may say that I am not without reputation in the country ; and proud as I am to accept this sacred trust , this money which the late Mr. Antony Clifton has seen fit — ( modestly ) one cannot say why — to bequeath to me , yet the use of the name Wurzel-Flummery would be excessively awkward . CLIFTON ( cheerfully ) . Excessively . CRAWSHAW . My object in seeing you was to inquire if it was absolutely essential that the name should go with the money . CLIFTON . Well ( thoughtfully ) , you may have the name without the money if you like . But you must have the name . CRAWSHAW ( disappointed ) . Ah ! ( Bravely ) Of course , I have nothing against the name , a good old Hampshire name — CLIFTON ( shocked ) . My dear Mr. Crawshaw , you did n't think — you did n't really think that anybody had been called Wurzel-Flummery before ? Oh no , no . You and Mr. Meriton were to be the first , the founders of the clan , the designers of the Wurzel-Flummery sporran — CRAWSHAW . What do you mean , sir ? Are you telling me that it is not a real name at all ? CLIFTON . Oh , it 's a name all right . I know it is because — er — I made it up . CRAWSHAW ( outraged ) . And you have the impudence to propose , sir , that I should take a made-up name ? CLIFTON ( soothingly ) . Well , all names are made up some time or other . Somebody had to think of — Adam . CRAWSHAW . I warn you , Mr. Clifton , that I do not allow this trifling with serious subjects . CLIFTON . It 's all so simple , really .... You see , my Uncle Antony was a rather unusual man . He despised money . He was not afraid to put it in its proper place . The place he put it in was — er — a little below golf and a little above classical concerts . If a man said to him , “ Would you like to make fifty thousand this afternoon ? ” he would say — well , it would depend what he was doing . If he were going to have a round at Walton Heath — CRAWSHAW . It 's perfectly scandalous to talk of money in this way . CLIFTON . Well , that 's how he talked about it . But he did n't find many to agree with him . In fact , he used to say that there was nothing , however contemptible , that a man would not do for money . One day I suggested that if he left a legacy with a sufficiently foolish name attached to it , somebody might be found to refuse it . He laughed at the idea . That put me on my mettle . “ Two people , ” I said ; “ leave the same silly name to two people , two well-known people , rival politicians , say , men whose own names are already public property . Surely they would n't both take it . ” That touched him . “ Denis , my boy , you 've got it , ” he said . “ Upon what vile bodies shall we experiment ? ” We decided on you and Mr. Meriton . The next thing was to choose the name . I started on the wrong lines . I began by suggesting names like Porker , Tosh , Bugge , Spiffkins — the obvious sort . My uncle — CRAWSHAW ( boiling with indignation ) . How dare you discuss me with your uncle , Sir ! How dare you decide in this cold-blooded way whether I am to be called — ah — Tosh — or — ah — Porker ! CLIFTON . My uncle would n't bear of Tosh or Porker . He wanted a humorous name — a name he could roll lovingly round his tongue — a name expressing a sort of humorous contempt — Wurzel-Flummery ! I can see now the happy ruminating smile which came so often on my Uncle Antony 's face in those latter months . He was thinking of his two Wurzel-Flummerys . I remember him saying once — it was at the Zoo — what a pity it was he had n't enough to divide among the whole Cabinet . A whole bunch of Wurzel-Flummerys ; it would have been rather jolly . CRAWSHAW . You force me to say , sir , that if that was the way you and your uncle used to talk together at his death can only be described as a merciful intervention of Providence . CLIFTON . Oh , but I think he must be enjoying all this somewhere , you know . I hope he is . He would have loved this morning . It was his one regret that from the necessities of the case he could not live to enjoy his own joke ; but he had hopes that echoes of it would reach him wherever he might be . It was with some such idea , I fancy , that toward the end he became interested in spiritualism . CRAWSHAW ( rising solemnly ) . Mr. Clifton , I have no interest in the present whereabouts of your uncle , nor in what means he has of overhearing a private conversation between you and myself . But if , as you irreverently suggest , he is listening to us , I should like him to hear this . That , in my opinion , you are not a qualified solicitor at all , that you never had an uncle , and that the whole story of the will and the ridiculous condition attached to it is just the tomfool joke of a man who , by his own admission , wastes most of his time writing unsuccessful farces . And I propose — CLIFTON . Pardon my interrupting . But you said farces . Not farces , comedies — of a whimsical nature . CRAWSHAW . Whatever they were , sir , I propose to report the whole matter to the Law Society . And you know your way out , sir . CLIFTON . Then I am to understand that you refuse the legacy , Mr. Crawshaw ? CRAWSHAW ( startled ) . What 's that ? CLIFTON . I am to understand that you refuse the fifty thousand pounds ? CRAWSHAW . If the money is really there , I most certainly do not refuse it . CLIFTON . Oh , the money is most certainly there — and the name . Both waiting for you . CRAWSHAW ( thumping the table ) . Then , Sir , I accept them . I feel it my duty to accept them , as a public expression of confidence in the late Mr. Clifton 's motives . I repudiate entirely the motives that you have suggested to him , and I consider it a sacred duty to show what I think of your story by accepting the trust which he has bequeathed to me . You will arrange further matters with my solicitor . Good morning , Sir . CLIFTON ( to himself as he rises ) . Mr. Crawshaw here drank a glass of water . ( To CRAWSHAW ) Mr. Wurzel-Flummery , farewell . May I express the parting wish that your future career will add fresh lustre to — my name . ( To himself as he goes out ) Exit Mr. Denis Clifton with dignity . ( But he has left his papers behind him . ) ( CRAWSHAW , walking indignantly back to the sofa , sees the papers and picks them up . ) CRAWSHAW ( contemptuously ) . “ Watherston v. Towser — in re Great Missenden Canal Company ” Bah ! ( He tears them up and throws them into the fare . He goes back to his writing-table and is seated there as VIOLA , followed by MERITON , comes in . ) VIOLA . Father , Dick does n't want to take the money , but I have told him that of course he must . He must , must n't he ? RICHARD . We need n't drag Robert into it , Viola . CRAWSHAW . If Richard has the very natural feeling that it would be awkward for me if there were two Wurzel-Flummerys in the House of Commons , I should be the last to interfere with his decision . In any case , I do n't see what concern it is of yours , Viola . VIOLA ( surprised ) . But how can we get married if he does n't take the money ? CRAWSHAW ( hardly understanding ) . Married ? What does this mean , Richard ? RICHARD . I 'm sorry it has come out like this . We ought to have told you before , but anyhow we were going to have told you in a day or two . Viola and I want to get married . CRAWSHAW . And what did you want to get married on ? RICHARD ( with a smile ) . Not very much , I 'm afraid . VIOLA . We 're all right now , father , because we shall have fifty thousand pounds . RICHARD ( sadly ) . Oh , Viola , Viola ! CRAWSHAW . But naturally this puts a very different complexion on matters . VIOLA . So of course he must take it , must n't he , father ? CRAWSHAW . I can hardly suppose , Richard , that you expect me to entrust my daughter to a man who is so little provident for himself that he throws away fifty thousand pounds because of some fanciful objection to the name which goes with it . RICHARD ( in despair ) . You do n't understand , Robert . CRAWSHAW . I understand this , Richard . That if the name is good enough for me , it should be good enough for you . You do n't mind asking Viola to take your name , but you consider it an insult if you are asked to take my name . RICHARD ( miserably to VIOLA ) . Do you want to be Mrs. Wurzel-Flummery ? VIOLA . Well , I 'm going to be Miss Wurzel-Flummery anyhow , darling . RICHARD ( beaten ) . Heaven help me ! you 'll make me take it . But you 'll never understand . CRAWSHAW ( stopping to administer comfort to him on his way out ) . Come , come , Richard . ( Patting him on the shoulder ) I understand perfectly . All that you were saying about money a little while ago — it 's all perfectly true , it 's all just what I feel myself . But in practice we have to make allowances sometimes . We have to sacrifice our ideals for — ah — others . I shall be very proud to have you for a son-in-law , and to feel that there will be the two of us in Parliament together upholding the honour of the — ah — name . And perhaps now that we are to be so closely related , you may come to feel some day that your views could be — ah — more adequately put forward from my side of the House . RICHARD . Go on , Robert ; I deserve it . CRAWSHAW . Well , well ! Margaret will be interested in our news . And you must send that solicitor a line — or perhaps a telephone message would be better . ( He goes to the door and turns round just as he is going out . ) Yes , I think the telephone , Richard ; it would be safer . [ Exit . ] RICHARD ( holding out his hands to VIOLA ) . Come here , Mrs. Wurzel-Flummery . VIOLA . Not Mrs. Wurzel-Flummery ; Mrs. Dick . And soon , please , darling . ( She comes to him . ) RICHARD ( shaking his head sadly at her ) . I do n't know what I 've done , Viola . ( Suddenly ) But you 're worth it . ( He kisses her , and then says in a low voice ) And God help me if I ever stop thinking so ! [ Enter MR. DENIS CLIFTON . He sees them , and walks about very tactfully with his back towards them , humming to himself . ] RICHARD . Hullo ! CLIFTON ( to himself ) . Now where did I put those papers ? ( He hums to himself again . ) Now where — oh , I beg your pardon ! I left some papers behind . VIOLA . Dick , you 'll tell him . ( As she goes out , she says to CLIFTON ) Good-bye , Mr. Clifton , and thank you for writing such nice letters . CLIFTON . Good-bye , Miss Crawshaw . VIOLA . Just say it to see how it sounds . CLIFTON . Good-bye , Miss Wurzel-Flummery . VIOLA . ( smiling happily ) . No , not Miss , Mrs. [ She goes out . ] CLIFTON . ( looking in surprise from her to him ) . You do n't mean — RICHARD . Yes ; and I 'm taking the money after all , Mr. Clifton . CLIFTON . Dear me , what a situation ! ( Thoughtfully to himself ) I wonder how a rough scenario would strike the managers . RICHARD . Poor Mr. Clifton ! CLIFTON . Why poor ? RICHARD . You missed all the best part . You did n't hear what I said to Crawshaw about money before you came . CLIFTON ( thoughtfully ) . Oh I was it very — ( Brightening up ) But I expect Uncle Antony heard . ( After a pause ) Well , I must be getting on . I wonder if you 've noticed any important papers lying about , in connection with the Great Missenden Canal Company — a most intricate case , in which my clerk and I — ( He has murmured himself across to the fireplace , and the fragments of his important case suddenly catch his eye . He picks up one of the fragments . ) Ah , yes . Well , I shall tell my clerk that we lost the case . He will be sorry . He had got quite fond of that canal . ( He turns to go , but first says to MERITON ) So you 're taking the money , Mr. Meriton ? RICHARD . Yes . CLIFTON . And Mr. Crawshaw too ? RICHARD . Yes . CLIFTON ( to himself as he goes out ) . They are both taking it . ( He stops and looks up to UNCLE ANTONY with a smile . ) Good old Uncle Antony — he knew — he knew ! ( MERITON stands watching him as he goes . )</docImprint>

       <stage>[ SCENE .— The hall of SIR JAMES FARRINGDON 'S house in the country . ]</stage>
      </stage>
      <stage>It is a large and pleasantly unofficial sort of room , used as a meeting-place rather than a resting place . To be in it pledges you to nothing ; whereas in the billiard-room you are presumably pledged to billiards . The French windows at the back open on to lawns ; the door on the right at the back will take you into the outer hall ; the door on the left leads to the servants ’ quarters ; the door on the right in front will disclose other inhabited rooms to you . An oak gallery runs round two sides of the hall and descends in broad and gentle stairs down the right side of it . Four stairs from the bottom it turns round at right angles and deposits you fairly in the hall . Entering in this way , you will see immediately opposite to you the large open fireplace occupied by a pile of unlit logs — for it is summer . There is a chair on each side of the fireplace , but turned now away from it . In the left centre of the hall there is a gate-legged table to which trays with drinks on them , have a habit of finding their way ; it is supported on each side by a coffin-stool . A sofa , which will take two strangers comfortably and three friends less comfortably , comes out at right angles to the staircase , but leaves plenty of space between itself and the stool on its side of the table . Beneath the window on the left of the French windows is a small table on which letters and papers are put ; beneath the window on the other side is a writing-table . The walls are decorated impartially with heads of wild animals and of Farringdons .</stage>
      <stage>At the present moment the inhabitants of the hall are three . HENRY WENTWORTH , a barrister between forty , and fifty , dressed in rather a serious tweed suit , for a summer day , is on the sofa . THOMAS TODD , an immaculate young gentleman of twenty-five , is half-sitting on the gate-legged table with one foot on the ground and the other swinging . He is dressed in a brown flannel coat and white trousers , shoes and socks , and he has a putter in his hand indicative of his usual line of thought . The third occupant is the Butler , who , in answer to TOMMY 'S ring , has appeared with the drinks .</stage>
      <stage>The time is about four o'clock on a June afternoon .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p><stage>to the Butler</stage>Thanks , James ; just leave it here .<stage>Exit Butler .</stage>Whisky or lemonade , Wentworth ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>Neither , thanks , Tommy .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p>Well , I will .<stage>He pours himself out some lemonade and takes a long drink .</stage>I should have thought you would have been thirsty , driving down from London a day like this .<stage>He finishes his drink .</stage>Let 's see , where was I up to ? The sixth , was n't it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>The sixth , Tommy .<stage>With resignation</stage>Only twelve more .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p>Yes , that 's right . Well , at the seventh I got an absolutely topping drive , but my approach was sliced a bit . However , I chipped on within about six feet , and was down in four . Gerald took it in three , but I had a stroke , so I halved . Then the eighth I told you about .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>Was that where you fell into the pond ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p>No , no ; you 're thinking of the fifth , where I topped my drive into the pond .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>I knew the pond came into it somewhere . I hoped — I mean I thought you fell in .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p>Look here , you must remember the eighth , old chap ; that was the one I did in one . Awful bit of luck .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>Bit of luck for me too , Tommy .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p>Why ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>Because now you can hurry on to the ninth .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p>I say , Wentworth , I thought you were keen on golf .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>Only on my own .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p>You 're a fraud . Here I 've been absolutely wasting my precious time on you and — I suppose it would n't even interest you to hear that Gerald went round in seventy-two — five under bogey ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>It would interest me much more to hear something about this girl he 's engaged to .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p>Pamela Carey ? Oh , she 's an absolute ripper .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>Yes , but you 've said that of every girl you 've met .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p>Well , dash it ! you do n't expect me to describe what she looks like , do you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>Well , no . I shall see that for myself directly . One gets introduced , you know , Tommy . It is n't as though I were meeting her at Charing Cross Station for the first time . But who is she ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p>Well , she was poor old Bob 's friend originally . He brought her down here , but , of course , as soon as she saw Gerald —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p><stage>quickly</stage>Why , poor old Bob ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p>I do n't know ; everybody seems to call him that . After all , he is n't quite like Gerald , is he ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>Paderewski is n't quite like Tommy Todd , but I do n't say “ poor old Paderewski ” — nor “ poor old Tommy , ” if it comes to that .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p>Well , hang it , old man , there 's a bit of a difference . Paderewski and I — well , I mean we do n't compete .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>Oh , I do n't know . I daresay he 's as rotten at golf as you , if the truth were really known .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p>No , but seriously , it 's a bit different when you get two brothers like Gerald and Bob ; and whatever the elder one does , the younger one does a jolly sight better . Now Paderewski and I —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>Good heavens ! I wish I had n't started you on that . Get back to Bob . I thought Bob was on the Stock Exchange and Gerald in the Foreign Office . There can n't be very much competition between them there .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p>Well , but there you are ! Why is n't Bob in the Foreign Office and Gerald on the Stock Exchange ? Why , because Gerald 's the clever one , Gerald 's the popular one , the good-looking one , the lucky one , the county cricketer , the plus three at golf —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>Oh Lord ! I thought you 'd get golf into it . I suppose you were working up to your climax . Poor old Bob is about eighteen at golf , eh ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p>As a matter of fact , he 's a very decent five . And there you are again . In any other family , Bob would be thought rather a nut . As it is —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>As it is , Tommy , there are about thirty-five million people in England who 've never played golf and who would recognize Bob , if they met him , for the decent English gentleman that he is .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p>I think you exaggerate , old chap . Golf 's been getting awfully popular lately .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>Personally I am very fond of Bob .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p>Oh , so am I . He 's an absolute ripper . Still , Gerald , you know — I mean it 's jolly bad luck on poor old Bob . Now Paderewski and I —</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>Enter GERALD from the garden , a charming figure in a golfing coat and white flannels . Perhaps he is a little conscious of his charm ; if so , it is hardly his fault , for hero-worship has been his lot from boyhood . He is now about twenty-six ; everything that he has ever tried to do he has done well ; and , if he is rather more unembarrassed than most of us when praised , his unself-consciousness is to a stranger as charming as the rest of him . With it all he is intensely reserved , with the result that those who refuse to succumb to his charm sometimes make the mistake of thinking that there is nothing behind it .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Hallo , Wentworth , how are you ? All right ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p><stage>getting up and shaking hands</stage>Yes , thanks . How are you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Simply bursting . Have you seen your room and all that sort of thing ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>Yes , thanks .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Good . And Tommy 's been entertaining you .<stage>To TOMMY</stage>Tommy , I interrupted your story about Paderewski . I do n't think I know it .<stage>To WENTWORTH</stage>You must listen to this ; it may be fairly new .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p>Do n't be an ass . As a matter of fact , we were discussing something quite serious .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>to WENTWORTH</stage>How long have you been here ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>About ten minutes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>And Tommy has n't told you that he did the eighth in one this morning ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>He has n't really told me yet . He 's only mentioned it once or twice in passing .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p><stage>modestly</stage>Well , I mean it 's bound to appear in the papers , so naturally one —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Oh , it 's a great business . Champagne will flow like water to-night . There will also be speeches .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>Which reminds me , Gerald , I have to congratulate you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Thank you very much . When you 've seen her you 'll want to do it again .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking through the window</stage>Hallo , there 's Letty .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>If you want to tell her about it , run along , Tommy .</p>

       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p><stage>smiling</stage>And Gerald did n't go with her ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>smiling</stage>At least six people suggested that Gerald should go with her . They suggested it very loudly and archly —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>So Gerald did n't ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>So Gerald did n't .<stage>After a pause</stage>I can n't stand that sort of thing .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>What sort of thing ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>after a pause</stage>Poor old boy ! you 've never been in love — barring the nine or ten times you 're just going to tell me about . I mean never really in love .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>Do n't drag me into it . What is it you can n't stand ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>People being tactful about Pamela and me .... Aunt Tabitha asked me yesterday if she might have Pamela for half an hour to do something or other — as if she were an umbrella , with my initials on it .... And somebody else said , “ I 've quite fallen in love with your Pamela ; I hope you do n't mind . ” Mind ? I tell you , Wentworth , my boy , if you are n't in love with Pamela by Tuesday , there 'll be the very deuce of a row . Your electro-plated butter-dish , or whatever it 's going to be , will be simply flung back at you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>Well , as long as Miss Pamela understands —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Of course she understands . We understand each other .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p><stage>preening himself</stage>Then I 'll do my best . Mind , if she does happen to reciprocate my feelings , I wash my hands of all responsibility .<stage>Going towards the staircase</stage>Good-afternoon , Miss Farringdon .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MISS FARRINGDON is coming slowly down the stairs .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>Good-afternoon , Mr. Wentworth . Welcome .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>She must be well over eighty . She was pretty once , and sharp-tongued ; so much you could swear to now . For the rest she is very , very wise , and intensely interested in life .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>going over and kissing her</stage>Good-morning , Aunt Tabitha . Your chair is waiting for you .<stage>He conducts her to it .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>I 'm a nasty cross old thing before lunch , Mr. Wentworth , so I do n't come down till afterwards nowadays . Is Gerald being as charming as usual ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p><stage>smiling</stage>Oh , pretty well .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking at her lovingly and then turning to WENTWORTH</stage>It 's having a very bad effect on her , this morning seclusion . She 's supposed to be resting , but she spends her time trying to think of nasty things to say about me . The trouble with a mind like Aunt Tabitha 's is that it can n't think of anything really nasty .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>The trouble with Gerald , Mr. Wentworth , is that he goes about expecting everybody to love him . The result is that they nearly all do . However , he can n't get round me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>It is n't true , Wentworth ; she adores me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>He would n't be happy if he did n't think so .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p><stage>gracefully</stage>I can sympathize with him there .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>The slight coolness which you perceive to have arisen between my Aunt Tabitha and myself is due to the fact that I discovered her guilty secret a few days ago . For years she has pretended that her real name was Harriet . I have recently found out that she was christened Tabitha — or , anyhow , would have been , if the clergyman had known his job .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>My great-nephew , Gerald , Mr. Wentworth —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Nephew , Wentworth . I agreed to waive the “ great ” a long time ago .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>You 'll excuse my asking , but do you never talk to each other except through the medium of a third person ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p><stage>to GERALD</stage>That 's how they prefer to do it in the Foreign Office . Is n't it , dear ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Always , Aunt Tabitha . But really , you know , we both ought to be talking to Wentworth and flaking after his mother and his liver — and things like that .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Yes , I 'm afraid we 're rather rude , Mr. Wentworth . The</l>
        <l>Farringdons ’ great fault .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p><stage>protesting</stage>Oh no !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>How is Mrs. Wentworth ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>Wonderfully well , thank you , considering her age .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>Dear me , we met first in 1850 .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>All frills and lavender .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>And now here 's Gerald engaged . Have you seen Pamela yet ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>Not yet . I have been hearing about her from Tommy . He classes her with the absolute rippers .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Good old Tommy !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>Yes , she 's much too good for Gerald .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Of course she is , Aunt Tabitha . But if women only married men who were good enough for them , where should we be ? As lots of young men said to you , in vain — on those afternoons when they read Tennyson aloud to you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>She ought to have married Bob .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p><stage>surprised and amused</stage>Bob ? Is Bob good enough for her ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>She would have made a good wife for Bob .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>Enter suddenly LETTY HERBERT and TOMMY from the garden . LETTY is an entirely delightful irresponsible girl of the type which might have shocked Queen Victoria . However , she seems to suit TOMMY . They are not engaged yet , but she has already that air of proprietorship .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LETTY</speaker>
       <p>I say , Tommy did the eighth in one . Why , there 's Aunt Harriet .<stage>Going over and kissing her</stage>How are you , darling ? Tommy 's done the eighth in one . I know it does n't mean much to you , but do say hooray , because he 's so bucked about it .</p>

       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>

       <speaker>LETTY</speaker>
       <p><stage>shaking hands eagerly</stage>How do you do ? I say , Tommy did the eighth in one . Do you know Tommy — or the eighth ?</p>

       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>Both , Miss Herbert .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>To a man who knows both , the performance seems truly astonishing .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>I do n't know anything about golf , Mr. Todd . But doing anything in one sounds rather clever . So I say hooray , too .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p>I wish you 'd let me teach you , Miss Farringdon . Lots of people begin when they 're frightfully old .</p>

       <speaker>LETTY</speaker>
       <p><stage>to WENTWORTH</stage>This is one of Tommy 's polite days .</p>

       <p>Mr. Todd 's famous old-world courtesy is the talk of many a salon .</p>

       <p>I love Tommy when he apologizes .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>Enter SIR JAMES and LADY FARRINGDON from the door to front of the staircase . SIR JAMES , in a country check-suit , is a man of no particular brain and no ideas , but he has an unconquerable belief in himself , and a very genuine pride in , and admiration of , GERALD . His grey hair is bald on the top , and he is clean-shaven except for a hint of whisker . He might pass for a retired Captain R. N ., and he has something of the quarter-deck manner , so that even a remark on the weather is listened to with attention . Neither of his sons loves him , but GERALD is no longer afraid of him . LADY FARRINGDON is outwardly rather intimidating , but she never feels so . She worships GERALD ; and would love a good many other people if they were not a little overawed by her .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>Ah , you 're here , Mr. Wentworth . How do you do ?</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>LETTY</speaker>
       <p>It 's much the nicest room to be in , Mr. Wentworth . There 's a straight way down the water-pipe in case of fire .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>And a straight way up in case of burglars .</p>

       <p><stage>to WENTWORTH</stage>You must stay till Thursday , if you can , and see the whole of the Surrey match . It is n't often Gerald gets a chance of playing for the county now . It 's difficult for him to get away from the Foreign Office . Lord Edward was telling me at the club the other day —</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>LETTY</speaker>
       <p><stage>TO LADY FARRINGDON</stage>Gerald dived off the Monk 's Rock this morning . I 'm glad I did n't see him . I should have been horribly frightened .</p>

       <speaker>LETTY</speaker>
       <p>Tommy , of course , slithered down over the limpets in the ordinary way .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p><stage>incisively</stage>Let 's all talk about Gerald .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>GERALD , who has been listening to all this with more amusement than embarrassment , gives a sudden shout of laughter .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Oh , Aunt Tabitha , you 're too lovely !<stage>He blows her a kiss and she shakes her stick at him .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <stage>Enter PAMELA from the door In front of the staircase , tall , beautiful and serene , a born mother . GERALD carried her off her feet a month ago , but it is a question if he really touched her heart — a heart moved more readily by pity than by love .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>Gerald , dear , I 'd know your laugh anywhere . Am I too late for the joke ?</p>

      <stage>Enter BOB from the outer hall in a blue flannel suit . He has spoilt any chance he had of being considered handsome by a sullen expression now habitual . Two years older than Gerald , he is not so tall , but bigger , and altogether less graceful . He has got in the way of talking in rather a surly voice , as if he suspected that any interest taken in him was merely a polite one .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Hullo , Bob ; good man .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>Hullo .<stage>He goes up to LADY FARRINGDON and kisses her .</stage>How are you , mother ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>It 's so nice that you could get away , dear .</p>
      </sp>

       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>How are you , father ? All right ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <p>Ah , Bob ! Come down to see your brother play for the county ?</p>
      </sp>

       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p><stage>quickly</stage>He 's come down to see me , have n't you , Bob ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>Hullo , Wentworth . Hullo , Letty . I say , I can n't shake hands with you all .<stage>He smacks TOMMY on the back and goes over to Miss FARRINGDON .</stage>How are you , dear ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>Very glad to see my elder great-nephew . I was getting tired of Gerald .</p>
      </sp>

       <p><stage>smiling</stage>It 's all right , mother . We quite understand each other .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>I quite understand Gerald .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>I say , are n't we going to have any tea ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>It 's early yet , dear . Gerald , you 'd like to have it outside , would n't you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Oh , rather . What do you say , Wentworth ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>I never want to be indoors in the country if I can help it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <p>Quite right , Wentworth — quite right . Gerald , you 'll just have time to take Wentworth round the stables before tea .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>You 'll have to see them officially after church to-morrow . I do n't know if you 'd care about a private view now .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <p>He must see your new mare . I should like to have his opinion of her .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p><stage>getting up</stage>I never know what to say to a mare , but I should like to come .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LETTY</speaker>
       <p>She answers to “ Hi ! ” or to any loud cry .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>I 'm sure you 'll be all right , Mr. Wentworth .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>There 's a way of putting one 's head on one side and saying , “ Ah ! ” Anybody who 's seen Tommy at the Royal Academy will know exactly what I mean .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>GERALD , PAMELA and WENTWORTH move towards the door .</stage>
      <sp>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>It 's all right , we 'll go and see the spaniels first .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p><stage>cheerfully</stage>Oh , I 'm all right with dogs .</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>Would you like to have tea outside , Aunt Harriet ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>I 'm not too old for that , Mary . Bob will bring me out . I want to have a word with him while I can . Everybody talks at once in this house .</p>
      </sp>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>Just as usual .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <p>Coming round to the stables ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ROB</speaker>
       <p>Later on , perhaps .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>Bob is bringing Aunt Harriet along , dear .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <p>Ah , yes .<stage>They go out together .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>Smoke , Bob , and tell me how horrible the City is .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>lighting a pipe and sitting down</stage>It 's damnable , Aunt Harriet .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>More damnable than usual ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>Yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>Any particular reason why ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>after a long pause</stage>No .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MISS FARRINGDON nods to herself and then speaks very casually .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>My bankers sent in my pass-book the other day . I seem to have a deal of money lying idle , as they call it . If anybody wanted it , I should really be in no hurry to get it back again .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>awkwardly</stage>Thanks very much . It is n't that .<stage>After a pause</stage>Not altogether .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>It was a great pity you ever went into the City , Bob .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>fiercely</stage>I could have told anybody that .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p><stage>after waiting for him to say something more</stage>Well , suppose we go into the garden with the others .<stage>She begins to get up and he goes to help her ,</stage>There 's nothing you want to tell me , Bob ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking away</stage>What would there be ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>I 'm a wise old woman , they say , and I do n't talk .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>I do n't think you can help me . Er — thanks very much .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p><stage>quite naturally , as she turns towards the door</stage>If you do n't mind giving me your arm .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>As they get to the door they are met by GERALD and PAMELA coming in .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Hullo , Bob , we were just coming back for you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>Thoughtful Gerald .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Pamela 's idea . She thought that the elder members of the family could discuss life more freely unhampered by the younger generation .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>What I really said was , “ Where 's Bob ? ”</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Well , it 's the same thing .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>Bob is looking after me , thank you very much .<stage>They go out together .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>after watching them go , to PAMELA</stage>Stay here a bit . There are too many people and dogs and things outside . Come and sit on the sofa and I 'll tell you all the news .<stage>He takes her hand and they go to the sofa together .</stage>What ages you 've been away !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>An hour and a half . And it need not have been that if you 'd come with me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>taking her hand</stage>If I had come with you , I would have held your hand all the way .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>I should n't have minded .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>But just think what would have happened : You would have had to have driven with one hand down all the hills ; we should have had a smash-up before we got halfway ; a well-known society beauty and a promising young gentleman in the Foreign Office would have been maimed for life ; and Bob would have to have walked here carrying his portmanteau . Besides , I love you going away from me when you come back . You 've only got to come into the room , and the sun seems to shine .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>The sun always shines on Gerald .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Does it ? That 's a different sort of sunshine . Not the gentle caressing September afternoon sunshine which you wear all round you .<stage>She is looking at him lovingly and happily as he says this , but she withdraws into herself quickly as he pulls himself up and says with a sudden change of tone</stage>Dear me , I 'm getting quite poetical , and two minutes ago I was talking to Wentworth about fetlocks .</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>I wonder how much you really want me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>I 'll show you when we 're married . I do n't think I could even begin to tell you now .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p><stage>wistfully</stage>Could n't you try ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>GERALD catches hold of her suddenly , and holding her tightly to him , kisses her again and again .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>There !</p>

       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p><stage>happily</stage>Oh , no , no , no , no !<stage>Earnestly</stage>Always want me very much , Gerald . Always be in need of me . Do n't be too successful without me . However much the sun shines on you , let me make it gentler and more caressing for you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>It is so , darling . Did n't I say so ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>Ah , but I want such a lot of telling .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>laughing happily as he goes over to the table by the fireplace and takes a cigarette</stage>Who was the fellow who threw something into the sea because he was frightened by his own luck ? What shall I throw ?<stage>Looking at a presentation clock on the mantelpiece</stage>That 's rather asking for it . In a way it would be killing two birds with one stone . Oh , Lord , I am lucky !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p><stage>coming to him and taking his arm</stage>As long as you do n't throw me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Pamela , you 're talking rubbish . I talk a good deal myself , but I do keep within the bounds . Let 's go and chatter to Bob about contangos . I do n't know what they are , but they sound extraordinarily sober .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>

       <p><stage>gently</stage>Poor old Bob !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>quickly</stage>Why poor old Bob ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>He 's worried about something . I tried to get him to tell me as we came from the station , but he would n't .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Poor old Bob ! I suppose things are going up — or down , or something . Brokerage one-eighth — that 's what 's worrying him , I expect .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>I think he wants to talk to you about it . Be nice to him , darling , wo n't you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>You know what I mean — sympathetic . I know it 's a difficult relationship — brothers .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>All relationships are difficult . But after you , he 's the person I love best in the world .<stage>With a laugh</stage>But I do n't propose to fall on his neck and tell him so .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p><stage>smiling</stage>I know you will help him if you can .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Of course I will , though I do n't quite see how .</l>
        <stage>Hopefully</stage>
        <l>Perhaps he 's only slicing his drives again .</l>

       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , I love you , Gerald .<stage>Wonderingly</stage>Do I love you , or am I only just charmed by you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>You said you loved me once . You can n't go back on that .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>Then I love you . And make a century for me on Monday .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Well , I 'll try . Of course the bowler may be in love too . But even if I get out first ball , I can say , “ Well , anyhow , Pamela loves me . ”</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , I think I hope you get out first ball .</p>

They sound so exactly as though they could sell you anything from a share to a shaving-brush . Marcus and Farringdon 's pure badger , two shillings — gilt-edged badger half-a-crown .</p>

       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>utterly surprised</stage>Bob ! Bob , old boy , what 's the matter ?<stage>Putting his hand on BOB 'S shoulder</stage>I say , Bob , I have n't hurt you , have I ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>hopelessly</stage>Oh , Jerry , I believe I 'm in the devil of a hole .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>You have n't called me “ Jerry ” since we were at school .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>You got me out of holes then — damn you ! and you were my younger brother . Oh , Jerry , get me out of this one .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>But , of course .<stage>Firmly , as if a little nervous of a scene from BOB</stage>My dear Bob , you 're as right as anything . You 've got nothing on earth to worry about . At the worst it 's only a question of money , and we can always put that right somehow .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>I 'm not sure that it is only a question of money .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>frightened</stage>What do you mean ?<stage>Turning away with a laugh</stage>You 're talking nonsense .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>Gerald , Marcus is a wrong un .<stage>Fiercely</stage>An out-and-out wrong un .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>The only time I saw him he looked like it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>God knows what he 's let me in for .</p>

       <p>You mean money ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>More than that , perhaps .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>You mean you 're just going bankrupt ?</p>

       <p>No .<stage>After a pause</stage>Prosecution .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Well , let them prosecute . That ends Marcus . You 're well rid of him .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>miserably</stage>Perhaps it is n't only Marcus .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>sharply , after this has sunk in</stage>What can they prosecute you for ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>speaking rapidly</stage>What the devil did they ever send me to the City for ? I did n't want to go . I was never any good at figures . I loathe the whole thing . What the devil did they want to send me there for — and shove me on to a wrong un like Marcus ? That 's his life , messing about with money in the City . How can I stand out against a man like that ? I never wanted to go into it at all .</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>You see , Jerry , I 'm so hopeless at that sort of business . Naturally I got in the way of leaving things to Marcus . But that 's all .<stage>Resentfully</stage>Of course , that 's all .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Good . Well , then , you 're making much too much fuss about it . My dear boy , innocent people do n't get put into prison nowadays . You 've been reading detective stories . “ The Stain on the Bath Mat , ” or “ The Crimson Sponge . ” Good Lord ! I shall be coming to you next and saying that I 'm going to be put in prison for selling secret documents to a foreign country . These things do n't happen ; they do n't really , old boy .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>cheered , but not convinced</stage>I do n't know ; it looks devilish bad , what I can make of it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Well , let 's see what I can make of it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>trying not to show his eagerness</stage>I was wondering if you would . Come up on Monday and we 'll have a go at it together . Marcus has gone , of course . Probably halfway to South America by now .<stage>Bitterly</stage>Or wherever you go to .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Right-o ! At least , I can n't come on Monday , of course , but we 'll have a go at it on Thursday .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>Why can n't you come on Monday ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Well , the Surrey match .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>bitterly</stage>I suppose as long as you beat Surrey , it does n't matter if I go to prison .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>annoyed</stage>Oh , shut up about going to prison ! There 's not the slightest chance of your going to prison . You know perfectly well , if there were , that I 'd walk on my hands and knees to London to-night to try and stop it . As it is , I have promised to play for the county ; it 's a particularly important match , and I do n't think it 's fair to let them down . Anyway , if I did , the whole family would want to know why , and I do n't suppose you want to tell them that yet .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>mumbling</stage>You could say the Foreign Office had rung you up .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>earnestly</stage>Really , Bob old boy , I 'm sure you 're making too much of it . Dammit ! you 've done nothing wrong ; what is there to worry about ? And if it 's only a question of money , we 'll manage it on our heads , somehow . I 'll come up directly the match is over . It may be Tuesday night , with luck .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>grumbling</stage>If the weather 's like this , it 's bound to last three days .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Then at the worst , I 'll come first train Thursday morning . That I promise . Anyway , why do n't you consult Wentworth ? He 's a good chap and he knows all about the law . He could probably help you much more than I could .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>I suppose you think I like talking about it to everybody .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>getting up and touching BOB gently on the shoulder as he goes past him</stage>Poor old Bob ! But you 're as right as anything . I 'll come up by the first train on Thursday and we 'll — good Lord !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>What 's the matter now ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>I am a damned fool ! Why , of course , we arranged —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>sneeringly</stage>And now you can n't come on Thursday , I suppose .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Why , you see , I arranged —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>You must keep your promise to the county , but you need n't keep your promise to me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Yes , but the trouble is I promised Pamela — oh , well , that will have to go ; she 'll understand . All right , Bob , that holds . Directly the match is over I come . And for the Lord 's sake , keep smiling till then .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>It 's all very well for you .... I wish you could have — well , anyhow , I suppose Thursday 's better than nothing . You 'll see just how it is then .<stage>Getting up</stage>You wo n't say anything about it to the others ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Of course not . What about Pamela ? Does she know anything ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>She knows that I 'm worried about something , but of course she does n't know what I 've told you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>All right , then I wo n't tell her anything . At least , I 'll just say that bananas remain firm at 127 , and that I 've got to go and see my broker about it .<stage>Smiling</stage>Something like that .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>BOB goes towards the garden , while GERALD stops to wait for PAMELA . At the door he turns round .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>awkwardly</stage>Er — thanks .<stage>Exit .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <stage>GERALD throws him a nod , as much as to say , “ That 's all right . ” He stands looking after him , gives a little sigh , laughs and says to himself , “ Poor old Bob ! ” He is half-sitting on , half-leaning against the table , thinking it all over , when PAMELA comes in again .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>I waited for him to go ; I knew he wanted to talk to you about something . Gerald , he is all right , is n't he ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>taking her hands</stage>Who ? Bob ? Oh yes , he 's all right . So is Pamela .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>Sure ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Oh yes , he 's all right .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>I take rather a motherly interest in Bob , you know . What was worrying him ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>smiling</stage>His arithmetic again ; compound interest . His masters are very pleased with his progress in English . And he wants more pocket-money . He says that fourpence a week does n't give him enough scope .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p><stage>smiling</stage>But he really is all right ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Well , I 've got to go up on Thursday to see his House Master — I mean I 've got to go up to town on Thursday .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p><stage>drawing back</stage>Thursday ? That was our day , Gerald .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Yes , I know ; it 's a confounded nuisance .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p><stage>slowly</stage>Yes , it is rather a — nuisance .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>I 'm awfully sorry , darling . I hate it just as much as you do .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>I wonder if you do .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>shaking his head at her</stage>Oh , woman , woman ! And you asked me to be kind to Bob .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>It is for Bob ? He really does want you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>He thinks I can help him if I go up on Thursday .<stage>Smiling</stage>We are n't going to quarrel about that .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p><stage>holding out her hand to him</stage>Come along . Of course we are n't going to quarrel — I do n't think I could quarrel with you for more than five minutes . Only — you make me wonder sometimes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>getting up and taking her arm</stage>What do you wonder about ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>Oh — things .</p>

     </div>
     <div type="act" n="2">
      <head type="act">ACT II</head>
      <stage>It is a quiet old-fashioned hotel which SIR JAMES and LADY FARRINGDON patronize in Dover Street on their occasional visits to London . Their private sitting-room is furnished in heavy early Victorian style . A couple of gloomy palms help to decorate the room , on whose walls are engravings of Landseer 's masterpieces .</stage>
      <stage>MASON , a faithful kindly body , once nurse , now familiar servant , is at the table arranging flowers , in a gallant attempt to make the room more cheerful . As she fills each vase she takes it to its place , steps back to consider the effect , and returns to fill the next one . GERALD , in London clothes as attractive as ever , but looking none rather serious , discovers her at work .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Hullo , Nanny , when did you come ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MASON</speaker>
       <p>This morning , sir . Her ladyship telegraphed for me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>smiling affectionately at her</stage>Whenever there 's any trouble about , we send for Nanny . I wonder she ever came to London without you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MASON</speaker>
       <p>I told her I 'd better come , but she would n't listen to me . Dear , dear ! there is trouble about now Master Gerald .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MASON</speaker>
       <p>I thought a few flowers would cheer us up . I said to Mr. Underhill before I started , “ Give me some flowers to take with me , ” I said , “ so that I can make the place look more homey and comfortable for her ladyship . ”</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>And you have . No one like Nanny for that .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MASON</speaker>
       <p><stage>timidly</stage>Is there any news of Master Bob this morning ? Of course , we 've all been reading about it in the papers . They 're not going to send him to prison ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>I 'm afraid they are .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MASON</speaker>
       <p>Dear , dear !<stage>She goes on arranging the flowers .</stage>He 's not in prison now ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>No ; he 's on bail for the moment . Perhaps he 'll be round here for lunch . But I 'm afraid that to-night —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MASON</speaker>
       <p>Even as a baby he was never quite like you , Master Gerald . Never was there such a little lamb as you . How long will they send him to prison for ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>We do n't know yet ; I expect we shall know this evening . But there 's no doubt which way the case is going .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MASON</speaker>
       <p>Two of the men were making their bets about it over the supper-table last night . I did n't wait long before giving them a piece of my mind , I can promise you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>

       <p><stage>turning round sharply</stage>Who were they ? Out they go to-morrow .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MASON</speaker>
       <p>That would n't be quite fair , would it , sir ? They 're young and thoughtless like .</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MASON</speaker>
       <p>It would n't be anything very bad that Master Bob has done ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>emphatically</stage>No , Nanny . No . Nothing bad ; only — stupid .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MASON</speaker>
       <p>I did n't know they put you in prison for being stupid . Some of us have been lucky .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>They can put you in prison for everything Nanny — being stupid or being wise , being bad or being good , being poor or — yes , or being rich .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MASON</speaker>
       <p><stage>putting her last touches to the flowers</stage>There ! Now it looks much more like what her ladyship 's used to . If you are n't sent to prison for being bad , it does n't seem to matter so much .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Well — it is n't nice , you know .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MASON</speaker>
       <p>There 's lots of things that are n't nice in the world . They have n't come your way yet , and I only hope they never will .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>I wish they had n't come Bob 's way .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MASON</speaker>
       <p>Ah , Master Bob was born to meet them . Well , I 'll go up to her ladyship now .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Oh , are they back ?</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MASON</speaker>
       <p>They came back about ten minutes ago , Master Gerald . And went up to their rooms .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Tell mother I 'm here , will you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MASON</speaker>
       <p>Yes , Sir .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>She goes out and comes back almost at once with PAMELA .</stage>
      <sp>

       <p>Pamela ! Have you just come up ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>Mother and I are staying with Aunt Judith . Oh , Gerald ! Poor , poor Bob !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Have you seen him ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>He came down to us last week , and he has been writing the most heart-rending letters .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>You 're a dear to be so good to him .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>How can one help it ? Oh , Gerald , he has been stupid ! How he could have gone on as he did , hating it all , understanding nothing , but feeling all the time that things were wrong , and yet too proud or too obstinate to ask for help — had n't you any idea , any of you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>awkwardly</stage>You never could get him to talk about the City at all . If you asked him , he changed the subject .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p><stage>reproachfully</stage>Ah ! but how did you ask him ? Lightly ? Jokingly ? “ Hullo , Rothschild , how 's the City getting on ? ” That sort of way . You did n't really mind .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>smiling</stage>Well , if it comes to that , he did n't much mind how I was getting on at the Foreign Office . He never even said , “ Hullo , Grey , how are Balkans ? ”</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>You had plenty of people to say that ; Bob was different . I think I was the first person he really talked to about himself . That was before I met you . I begged him then to get out of it — little knowing . I wonder if it would have made any difference if you had gone up with him on — Oh , well , it does n't matter now .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>defensively</stage>What were you going to say ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>Nothing .<stage>Looking at him thoughtfully</stage>Poor Gerald ! it 's been bad for you too .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>You 're not making it better by suggesting that I 've let Bob down in some way — I do n't quite know how .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p><stage>in distress</stage>Oh , Gerald , do n't be angry with me — I do n't want to hurt you . But I can only think of Bob now . You 're so — you want so little ; Bob wants so much . Why does n't he come ? I sent a note round to his rooms to say that I 'd be here . Does n't he have lunch here ? Oh , Gerald , suppose the case is over , and they 've taken him to prison , and I 've never said good-bye to him . He said it would n't be over till this evening , but how would he know ? Oh , I can n't bear it if they 've taken him away , and his only friend never said good-bye to him .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Pamela , Pamela , do n't be so silly . It 's all right , dear ; of course I 'm not angry with you . And of course Bob will be here . I rang up Wentworth an hour ago , and he said the case can n't end till this evening .</p>

       <p>Thank you , Nanny .<stage>Exit MASON .</stage><stage>To PAMELA</stage>May I ?<stage>He reads it</stage>Oh , I say , this is rather — this is from Wentworth . He 's taken Bob round to lunch with him .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>Supposing he does n't come ? Supposing he did n't get my note ? It may be waiting for him in his rooms now .</p>
      </sp>

       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>All right , then , darling , I 'll ring him up .</p>

       <p><stage>determined</stage>No . I 'll do it . Yes , Gerald , I know how to manage him . It is n't only that I must see him myself , but if —<stage>bravely</stage>if the case is to be over this evening , and if what we fear is going to happen , he must — oh , he must say good-bye to his mother too .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Well , if that 's all , I 'll tell him .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>He might n't come for you . He will for me ; No , Gerald ; I mean it . None of you understand him . I do .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>But supposing he 's already started and you miss him ?</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>I 'll telephone to him at his rooms . Oh , do n't stand there talking —</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>Now you 're here , Gerald . I telegraphed for Mason . She 's such a comfort . How nicely she 's done the flowers !<stage>She sits down on the sofa .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>I 'm so glad you sent for her .</p>

       <p>I do n't think your father —</p>

      <stage>Enter SIR JAMES .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <p>Ah , Gerald , I had to take your mother out . She was — ah — overcome . They have adjourned , I suppose ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Yes . The judge is summing up directly after lunch . Bob will be round here when he 's had something to eat .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking at his watch</stage>Well , I suppose we ought to try and eat something .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>I could n't touch anything .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>going over to her</stage>Poor mother !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>Oh , Gerald , could n't you do anything ? I 'm sure if you 'd gone into the witness-box , or told the judge — Oh , why did n't you go to the Bar , and then you could have defended him . You would have been so much better than that stupid man .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <p>I must say I did n't at all like his tone . He 's practically making out my son to be an idiot .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Well , it 's really the only line he could take .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <p>What do you mean ? Bob is far from being an idiot .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>We always knew he was n't as clever as Gerald , dear .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>You see , Bob either understood what was going on or he did n't . If he did , then he 's in it as much as Marcus . If he did n't — well , of course we know that he did n't . But no doubt the jury will think that he ought to have known .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <p>The old story , a knave or a fool , eh ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>The folly was in sending him there .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <p><stage>angrily</stage>That was Parkinson 's fault . It was he who recommended Marcus to me . I shall never speak to that man again .<stage>To his wife</stage>Mary , if the Parkinsons call , you are out ; remember that .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>He never ought to have gone into business at all . Why could n't you have had him taught farming or estate agency or something ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <p>We 've got to move with the times , my boy . Land is played out as a living for gentlemen ; they go into business nowadays . If he can n't get on there , it 's his own fault . He went to Eton and Oxford ; what more does he want ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p><stage>to GERALD</stage>You must remember he is n't clever like you , Gerald .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Oh , well , it 's no good talking about it now . Poor old Bob ! Wentworth thinks —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <p>Ah , now why could n't Wentworth have defended him ? That other man — why , to begin with , I do n't even call him a gentleman .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Wentworth recommended him . But I wish he had gone to Wentworth before , as soon as he knew what was coming .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <p>Why did n't he come to me ? Why did n't he come to any of us ? Then we might have done something .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>Did n't he even tell you , Gerald ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>awkwardly</stage>Only just at the last . It was — it was too late to do anything then . It was the Saturday before he was — arrested .<stage>To himself</stage>“ The Saturday before Bob was arrested ” — what a way to remember anything by !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p><stage>to GERALD</stage>Bob is coming round , dear ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Yes . Wentworth 's looking after him . Pamela will be here too .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <p>We have n't seen much of Pamela lately . What does she think about it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>sharply</stage>What do you mean ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <p>The disgrace of it . I hope it 's not going to affect your engagement .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Disgrace ? what disgrace ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <p>Well , of course , he has n't been found guilty yet .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>What 's that got to do with it ? What does it matter what a lot of rotten jurymen think of him ? We know that he has done nothing disgraceful .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>I 'm sure Pamela would n't think anything like that of your brother , dear .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Of course she would n't . She 's been a perfect angel to Bob these last few weeks . What does it matter if he does go to prison ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <p>I suppose you think I shall enjoy telling my neighbours , when they ask me what my elder boy is doing , that he 's — ah — in prison .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Of course you wo n't enjoy it , and I do n't suppose Bob will enjoy it either , but that 's no reason why we should make it worse for him by pretending that he 's a disgrace to the family .<stage>Half to himself</stage>If anything we 've done has helped to send him to prison then it 's we who should be ashamed .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <p>I do n't profess to know anything about business , but I flatter myself that I understand my fellow men . If I had been in Bob 's place , I should have pretty soon seen what that fellow Marcus was up to . I do n't want to be unfair to Bob ; I do n't think that any son of mine would do a dishonourable action ; but the Law is the Law , and if the Law sends Bob to prison I can n't help feeling the disgrace of it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Yes , it 's rough on you and mother .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>I do n't mind about myself , dear . It 's you I feel so sorry for — and Bob , of course .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>I do n't see how it 's going to affect me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <p>In the Foreign Office one has to be like Caesar 's wife — above suspicion .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Yes , but in this case it 's Caesar 's brother-in-law 's partner who 's the wrong un . I do n't suppose Caesar was so particular about him .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>I do n't see how Caesar comes into it at all .</p>

       <p><stage>impatiently</stage>Oh , what 's the good of pretending this is a formal call , Wentworth ? Tell us about Bob ; how 's he taking it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>He does n't say much . He had lunch in my rooms — you got my message . He could n't bear the thought of being recognized by anyone , so I had something sent up .</p>

       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>Lady Farringdon , I can n't possibly tell you what I feel about this , but I should like to say that all of us who know Bob know that he could n't do anything dishonourable . Whatever the result of the trial , we shall feel just the same towards him .</p>
      </sp>

       <p>I think he has been very foolish ; whether the Law will call it criminally foolish I should hardly like to say . I only wish I had known about it before . He must have suspected something — did n't he say anything to anybody ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <p>He told Gerald , apparently . For some reason he preferred to keep his father in the dark .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>eagerly</stage>That was the day you came down to us , Wentworth ; five days before he was arrested . I asked him to tell you , but he would n't .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>Oh , it was too late then . Marcus had absconded by that time .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>earnestly</stage>Nobody could have helped him then , could they ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>Oh no .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>to himself</stage>Thank God .</p>

       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <p><stage>to LADY FARRINGDON as he looks at his watch</stage>Well , dear , I really think you ought to try to eat something .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>I could n't , James .<stage>Getting up</stage>But you must have your lunch .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Well , one ought n't to neglect one 's health , of course . But</l>
        <l>I insist on your having a glass of claret anyhow , Mary . What about you ,</l>
        <l>Gerald ?</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>I 'm all right . I 'll wait for Bob . I 've had something .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>You wo n't let Bob go without seeing us ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Of course not , dear .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>He goes with them to the door and sees them out .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>coming back to WENTWORTH</stage>Three months . By Jove ! that 's nothing .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>It 's long enough for a man with a grievance . It gives him plenty of time to brood about it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>anxiously</stage>Who has Bob got a grievance against particularly ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>The world .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>relieved</stage>Ah ! Still , three months , Wentworth . I could do it on my head .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>You 're not Bob . Bob will do it on his heart .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>We must buck him up , Wentworth . If he takes it the right way , it 's nothing . I had awful thoughts of five years .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>I 'm not the judge , you know . It may be six months .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Of course . How does he decide ? Tosses up for it ? Three months or six months or six years , it 's all the same to him , and there 's the poor devil in the dock praying his soul out that he 'll hit on the shortest one . Good Lord ! I 'm glad I 'm not a judge .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p><stage>drily</stage>Yes ; that is n't quite the way the Law works .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Oh , I 'm not blaming the Law .<stage>Smiling</stage>Stick to it , Wentworth , by all means . But I should make a bad judge . I should believe everything the prisoner said , and just tell him not to do it again .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>BOB comes in awkwardly and stops at the door .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p><stage>getting up</stage>Come along , Bob .<stage>Taking out his case</stage>Have a cigarette .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>gruffly</stage>No , thanks .<stage>He takes out his pipe .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>brightly but awkwardly</stage>Hullo , Bob , old boy .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>Where 's Pamela ? She said she 'd be here .<stage>He sits down in the large armchair .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>If she said she 'd be here , she will be here .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>with a grunt</stage>‘ M !<stage>There is an awkward silence .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>angrily to GERALD</stage>Why do n't you say something ? You came here to say good-bye to me , I suppose — why do n't you say it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>Steady , Bob .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>eagerly</stage>Look here , Bob , old son , you must n't take it too hardly . Wentworth thinks it will only be three months — do n't you , Wentworth ? You know , we none of us think any the worse of you for it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>Thanks . That will console me a lot in prison .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Oh , Bob , do n't be an old fool . You know what I mean . You have done nothing to be ashamed of , so what 's the good of brooding in prison , and grousing about your bad luck , and all that sort of thing ? If you had three months in bed with a broken leg , you 'd try and get some sort of satisfaction out of it — well , so you can now if you try .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p><stage>after waiting for BOB to say something</stage>There 's a good deal in that , Bob , you know . Prison is largely what you make it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>What do either of you know about it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Everything . The man with imagination knows the best and the worst of everything .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>fiercely</stage>Imagination ? You think I have n't imagined it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Wentworth 's right . You can make what you like of it . You can be miserable anywhere , if you let yourself be . You can be happy anywhere , if you try to be .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p><stage>to lead him on</stage>I can n't quite see myself being actually happy in prison , Gerald .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>I could , Wentworth , I swear I could .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>He 'd get popular with the warders ; he 'd love that .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>smiling</stage>Silly old ass ! But there are lots of things one can do in prison , only no one ever seems to think of them .<stage>He gets interested and begins to walk up and down the room .</stage>Now take this solitary confinement there 's so much fuss about . If you look at it the right way , there 's nothing in it at all .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>A bit boring , perhaps .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Boring ? Nonsense . You 're allowed one book a week from the prison library , are n't you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>You know , you must n't think that , because I 'm a barrister , I know all about the inside of a prison .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Well , suppose you are allowed one , and you choose a French dictionary , and try to learn it off by heart before you come out . Why , it 's the chance of a lifetime to learn French .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>Well , of course , if you could get a French dictionary —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Well , there 'd be some book there anyway . If it 's a Bible , read it . When you 've read it , count the letters in it ; have little bets with yourself as to which man 's name is mentioned most times in it ; put your money on Moses and see if you win . Anything like that . If it 's a hymn-book , count how many of the rhymes rhyme and how many do n't ; try and make them all rhyme . Learn ‘ em by heart ; I do n't say that that would be particularly useful to you in the business world afterwards , but it would be amusing to see how quickly you could do it , how many you could keep in your head at the same time .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>This is too intellectual for me ; my brain would go in no time .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>You are n't doing it all day , of course ; there are other things . Physical training . Swedish exercises . Tell yourself that you 'll be able to push up fifty times from the ground before you come out . Learn to walk on your hands . Practise cart-wheels , if you like . Gad ! you could come out a Hercules .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p>I can n't help feeling that the strain of improving myself so enormously would tell on me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Oh , you 'd have your games and so on to keep you bright and jolly .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p><stage>sarcastically</stage>Golf and cricket , I suppose ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Golf , of course ; I 'm doubtful about cricket . You must have another one for cricket , and I 'm afraid the warder would n't play . But golf , and squash rackets , and bowls , and billiards — and croquet —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p><stage>in despair</stage>Oh , go on !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Really , you 're hopeless . What the Swiss Family Wentworth would have done if they 'd ever been shipwrecked , I can n't think . Do n't you ever invent anything for yourself ?<stage>Excitedly</stage>Man alive ! you 've got a hymn-book and a piece of soap , what more do you want ? You can play anything with that .<stage>Thoughtfully</stage>Oh , I forgot the Olympic games . Standing long jump . And they talk about the boredom of it !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WENTWORTH</speaker>
       <p><stage>thoughtfully</stage>You 've got your ideas , Gerald . I wonder if you 'd act up to them .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>One never knows , but honestly I think so .<stage>There is silence for a little .</stage></p>

       <p>Is that all ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Oh , Bob , I know it 's easy for me to talk —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>I wonder you did n't say at once : “ Try not to think about it . ”</l>

      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>You 're a little difficult to help , you know Bob .<stage>Awkwardly</stage>I thought I might just give you an idea . If I only could help you , you know how —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>doggedly</stage>I asked you to help me once .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>distressed</stage>Oh , I did n't realize then — besides , Wentworth says it would have been much too late — did n't you , Wentworth ?</p>

       <p><stage>taking up his hat</stage>I think I must be getting along now .<stage>Holding out his hand</stage>Good-bye , Bob . I can only say , “ The best of luck , ” and — er — whatever happens , you know what I feel about it .</p>

       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>speaking quickly</stage>Look here , think what you like of me for the moment . But you must listen to what I 've got to say . You can imagine it 's somebody else speaking Pamela , if you like — Pamela would say just the same . You must not go to prison and spend your time there brooding over the wrongs people have done to you , and the way the world has treated you , and all that sort of thing . You simply must make an effort — and — and — well , come out as good a man as you went in . I know it 's easy for me to talk , but that does n't make it any the less true . Oh , Bob , be a — be a Sportsman about it ! You can take it out of me afterwards , if you like , but do n't take it out of me now by — by not bucking up just because I suggest it .</p>
      </sp>

       <p><stage>indignantly</stage>Pamela , you do n't believe this about me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>I can n't think of you , dear , now ; I can only think of Bob .<stage>GERALD gives a shrug and goes out .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>Pamela .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p><stage>coming to him</stage>Yes , dear ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>Come and sit near me . You 're the only friend I 've got in the world .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>You know that is n't true .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>She sits down in the armchair and he sits on the floor at her feet .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>If it had n't been for you , I should have shot myself long ago .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>That would have been rather cowardly , would n't it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>I am a coward . There 's something about the Law that makes people cowards . It 's so — what 's the word ? It goes on . You can n't stop it , you can n't explain to it , you can n't even speak to it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>But you can stand up to it . You need n't run away from it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>I think I would have broken my bail and run , if it had n't been for you . But you would have thought less of me if I had . Besides , I should n't have seen you again .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>Bob , you must n't just do , or not do , things for me ; you must do them because of yourself . You must be brave because it 's you , and honourable because it 's you , and cheerful because it 's you . You must n't just say , “ I wo n't let Pamela down . ” You must say , “ I wo n't let myself down . ” You must be proud of yourself .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>bitterly</stage>I 've been taught to be proud of myself , have n't I ? Proud of myself ! What 's the family creed ? “ I believe in Gerald . I believe in Gerald the Brother . I believe in Gerald the Son . I believe in Gerald the Nephew . I believe in Gerald the Friend , the Lover , Gerald the Holy Marvel . ” There may be brothers who do n't mind that sort of thing , but not when you 're born jealous as I was . Do you think father or mother cares a damn what happens to me ? They 're upset , of course , and they feel the disgrace for themselves , but the belovèd Gerald is all right , and that 's all that really matters .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>Bob , dear , forget about Gerald now . Do n't think about him ; think about yourself .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>I sha n't think about myself or about Gerald when I 'm in prison . I shall only think of you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>Will it help you to think of me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>You 're the only person in the world I 've got to think of . I found you first — and then Gerald took you from me . Just as he 's always taken everything from me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>No , no . Not about Gerald again . Let 's get away from Gerald .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>You can n't . He 's a devil to get away from .<stage>There is silence for a little .</stage>When I was a small boy , I used to pray very hard on the last day of the holidays for a telegram to come saying that the school had been burnt down .... It never had .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , Bob !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>I suppose I 've got about ten minutes more . But nothing will happen .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p><stage>in a hopeless effort to be hopeful</stage>Perhaps after all you might —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>Why can n't the world end suddenly now ? It would n't matter to anybody . They would n't know ; they would n't have time to understand .<stage>He looks up and sees her face of distress and says</stage>All right , Pamela , you need n't worry . I 'm going through with it all right .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>You must keep thinking of the afterwards . Only of the afterwards . The day when you come back to us .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>Will that be such a very great day ?<stage>PAMELA is silent .</stage>Triumphant procession through the village . All the neighbours hurrying out to welcome the young squire home . Great rush in the City to offer him partnerships .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p><stage>quietly</stage>Do you want to go back to the City ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>Good God , no !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>Then why are you being sarcastic about it ? Be honest with yourself , Bob . You made a mess of the City . Oh , I know you were n't suited to it , but men have had to do work they did n't like before now , and they have n't all made a mess of it . You 're getting your punishment now — much more than you deserve , and we 're all sorry for you — but men have been punished unfairly before now and they have stood it . You 'll have your chance when you come back ; I 'll stand by you for one , and you 've plenty of other friends ; but we can n't help a man who wo n't help himself , you know . Bon<stage>sulkily</stage>Thank you , Pamela .</p>

       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>

      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>after a pause</stage>Are you allowed to have letters in prison ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>I expect so . Every now and then .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>You will write to me ?</p>

       <p>Of course , dear ; whenever I may .</p>

       <p>No , dear .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>I 'll write to you whenever they let me . That will be something to look forward to . Will you meet me when I come out ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p><stage>happily</stage>Yes , Bob . So very gladly .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>I 'll let you know when it is . I expect I 'll be owed to .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>You must just think of that day all the time . Whenever you are unhappy or depressed or angry , you must look forward to that day .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>You 'll let it be a fine day , wo n't you ? What shall we do ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>

       <p>What shall we do directly after I come out ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>Well , I suppose we — I mean you — well , we 'll come up to London together , I suppose , and you 'll go to your old rooms . At least , if you still have them .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>instantly depressed again</stage>My old rooms . That 'll be lively .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>in a rush</stage>Whatever happens , you must n't desert me when I come out . I want you . I 've got to know you 're there , waiting for me . I 'm not making love to you , you 're engaged to somebody else , but you were my friend before you were his , and you 've got to go on being my friend . I want you — I want you more than he does . I 'm not making love to you ; you can marry him if you like , but you 've got to stand by me . I want you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>Have n't I stood by you ?</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>in a low voice</stage>You 've been an angel .<stage>He kisses her hands and then gets up and walks away from her ; with his back to her , looking out of the window , he says</stage>When are you marrying him ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p><stage>taken by surprise</stage>I — I do n't know , Bob . We had thought about — but , of course , things are different now . We have n't talked about it lately .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>casually</stage>I wonder if you 'd mind promising me something .</p>

       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>What is it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>Not to get married till after I come out .<stage>After waiting for PAMELA to speak</stage>You will have about forty years together afterwards . It is n't much to ask .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>Why should it make a difference to you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>It would .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>It is n't a thing I like making promises about . But I do n't suppose for a moment — Would it help you very much , Bob ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>from the bottom of his heart</stage>I do n't want Gerald 's wife to be waiting for me when I come out ; I want my friend .</p>

       <p>Tommy , I just adore you . Only I think you might have been a little more romantic about your proposal .</p>

       <p><stage>anxious</stage>I say , do you —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LETTY</speaker>
       <p>Yes . Strictly speaking , I do n't think anybody ought to propose with a niblick in his hand .</p>

       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p>It just sort of came then . Of course I ought to have put it down .</p>

       <p>You dear !... “ Letting his niblick go for a moment , Mr. T. Todd went on as follows : ‘ Letitia , my beloved , many moons have waxed and waned since first I cast eyes of love upon thee .

       <p>I want a wedding of my own . I 've never been married before , and perhaps I shall never be married again , and I 'm going to have a wedding all to myself . I do n't mind your being there , but I 'm not going to have crowds of other brides and bridegrooms taking up the whole aisle — said she , seizing her engagement-ring and — Oh , bother ! I have n't got one yet .</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LETTY</speaker>
       <p>It was n't your fault ; you were a dear .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>As a matter of fact , it will be rather lucky , you know . It will give us something to talk about when Bob comes .<stage>Smiling</stage>Thanks very much for arranging it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LETTY</speaker>
       <p>Poor old Bob ! I wonder what it feels like coming out of prison .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Rotten . Now , for the Lord 's sake , Tommy , be tactful .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LETTY</speaker>
       <p><stage>to GERALD</stage>I think he 'd be safer if he was n't . Tommy 's rather dangerous when he 's tactful .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>thoughtfully</stage>Yes , there is that .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p>It 's all the same to me . Only just let me know which you want .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Well , as long as you do n't overdo it . Do n't rub it in that he 's just left prison , and — do n't rub it out .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p>I suppose it would be quite safe to ask him to pass the mustard ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>laughing</stage>Good old Tommy !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LETTY</speaker>
       <p>You 'd better talk to me all the time , and then you 'll be all right .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>We 'll make it go between us . And , of course , Pamela will help to-morrow . Hooray for Pamela ! It makes me quite envious seeing you young people together . By the way , I interrupted you just now .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LETTY</speaker>
       <p>You did rather .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Well , I absolutely refuse to go away now . But , of course , if you 're longing to show each other the stables or anything —<stage>with a wave of the hand</stage>pray show . Or try anywhere else . Save for Aunt Tabitha 's room upstairs and the hall down here , the whole house is at your disposal .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LETTY</speaker>
       <p><stage>sitting down firmly</stage>Then I shall stay here . Is n't Aunt Mary back yet ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>They are probably still eating . It 's the very latest millionaire from London , so they 're having the lunch of their lives , I expect . Afterwards father will put him at his ease by talking about crops .<stage>Picking up a book and settling himself comfortably in front of the fire</stage>Tommy , if you can n't find a book , sing or something .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LETTY</speaker>
       <p>Oh , come on , Tommy .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>She jumps up and goes out of the door in front of the staircase . TOMMY following her .</stage>
      <stage>Left alone , GERALD closes his book with a slam . He stands up and takes the telegram out of his pocket and reads it again . He suddenly catches sight of MISS FARRINGDON in the gallery shove , calls out “ Hullo ! ” and goes up the stairs to meet her .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>as he goes</stage>You 're just the person I wanted , Aunt Tabitha . I 'm full of news .<stage>He kisses her at the top of the stairs .</stage>How are you , dear ?<stage>He offers her his arm .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>If I had wanted help , down the stairs , Gerald , my maid could have given it me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Yes , but your maid would n't have enjoyed giving it you ; I do .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>Charming Gerald .<stage>She comes down the stairs on his arm .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>No , happy Gerald .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>Is that part of the news ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>It 's all because of the news .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>He arranges her in her chair by the fire and sits on the coffin-stool near her .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>I heard Mr. Todd and Letty just now , so I suppose I sha n't be the first to hear it . What a pity !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Ah , but they do n't count .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>Why not ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Well , that 's part of the news . They 've just got engaged .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>In my young days they 'd have been engaged a long time ago . When are we going to see Pamela again ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>That 's more of the news . She 's coming down to-morrow .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>That will save you a lot in stamps .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>laughing</stage>Aunt Tabitha , you 're a witch . How did you know ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>Know what ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>That Pamela and I have n't been writing to each other .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p><stage>very innocently</stage>Have n't you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>No . You see — oh , I hate discussing Pamela with anyone , but you 're different .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>I always like that sort of compliment best , Gerald . The unintended sort .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>I think , you know , Pamela felt that Bob 's doing to prison might make a difference . I do n't mean that she did n't like the disgrace for herself , but that she was afraid that I might n't like it for her ; and so she went away , and beyond a letter or two at the start there has n't been a Pamela .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>But Gerald went on being successful ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Oh , Aunt Tabitha , Aunt Tabitha , if ever I were going to be conceited — and I do n't think I am really — you 'd soon stop it , would n't you ? I wonder if you do know me as well as you think . You think I 'm all outside , do n't you , and inside there 's nothing ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>Oh , you 've got brains , I 'll grant you that . You 're the first Farringdon that 's had any . Of the men , of course .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Oh , brains — I do n't mean brains . But you think that everything only touches me on the surface , and that nothing ever goes deep inside . You do n't believe I ever loved Pamela ; you do n't believe I love her now . You do n't believe I 've got a heart at all .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>Well , you 've never shown it . You 've shown a lot of delightful things which silly people mistake for it — but that 's all .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>curtly</stage>No , I 've never shown my heart to anybody . Some people can n't .<stage>Gently</stage>Perhaps I 'll show it to Pamela on my wedding-day .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>Dear me , have I been wrong all these years ? I should n't like to think that .<stage>After a pause</stage>Any more news ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>taking his thoughts off PAMELA</stage>Yes . Now this time , Aunt Tabitha , you 'll really be as pleased as I am .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>I wonder .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Oh yes , you will , because it 's about your favourite — Bob .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>So Bob 's my favourite ? I 'm learning a good many things to-day .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>He 's coming back this afternoon .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>Poor Bob ! I 'm glad he 's finished with that part of it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>You think he 's got the worst part coming ?</l>
        <stage>Smiling at her</stage>
        <l>Aunt</l>
        <l>Tabitha , have you got any influence with your nephew ?</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>You or Bob ?<stage>GERALD smiles and shakes his head .</stage>Oh , you mean James ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>It seems hard to realize that one 's father is anybody else 's nephew , but you are his aunt , and — Oh , do n't let him do anything stupid about Bob .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>Bob 's his own master ; he 's old enough to look after himself .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Yes , but he 's got in the way of being looked after by other people . I wish you would look after him and tell him what to do . It 's going to be difficult for him . I expect he 'll want to get away from all of us for a bit . Where 's he going , and what 's he going to do ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p><stage>after a pause</stage>When did you say Pamela was coming here ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>To-morrow . She 'll help , of course .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>Gerald , you 've been very nice to me always ; I do n't know why I 've been rather unkind to you sometimes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>What an idea ! You know I 've loved our little skirmishes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>That 's because you 've been happy , and have n't minded one way or another . But if ever you were in trouble , Gerald , I do n't think I should be unsympathetic .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>You dear , of course you would n't . But why do you say that now , just when I am so happy ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p><stage>getting up slowly</stage>I 'm feeling rather an old woman to-day . I think I 'll go and lie down .</p>

       <p><stage>jumping up</stage>I 'll ring for your maid .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>No , no ; I 'm not going upstairs , and I do n't want a maid when I 've got a great big nephew . Come and tuck me up on the sofa in the drawing-room ; I shall be quite happy there .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>She puts her hand on his arm , and they go together towards the door in front of the staircase .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MISS FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>Poor Gerald !</p>
      </sp>

      </sp>
      <stage>The door on the right at the back opens quietly and BOB comes in . He stands there for a moment looking at the hall , and then speaks over his shoulder to somebody behind him .</stage>

       <p>He never really loved you .</p>

       <p>We 've given up being cowards . Perhaps you 'd better try and find him . We 'll only tell Gerald . If we see the others , we 'll just have to make the best of it .</p>

      <stage>He takes her hand and tries to lead her towards the sofa , but she stops .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>Gerald , you 're making it very hard for me ; I 've got something to tell you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>afraid suddenly and speaking sharply</stage>What do you mean ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , do n't look at me like that — I know it will hurt you , but it wo n't be more than that . I want you to release me from my promise .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>What promise ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p><stage>in a low voice</stage>My promise to marry you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>I do n't understand . Why ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p><stage>bravely</stage>I want to marry Bob .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>Keeping his eyes on her all the time , GERALD moves slowly away from her .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>to himself</stage>Bob ! Bob ! But you knew Bob first .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>Yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>And then you promised to marry me . You could n't have been in love with him . I do n't understand .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p><stage>sadly</stage>I do n't understand either , but that 's how it 's happened .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>And to think how I 've been throwing you in Bob 's way , and wanting you and him to be fond of each other .<stage>Fiercely</stage>That did n't make you think that I did n't love you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p><stage>faltering</stage>I — I do n't — you did n't —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>I was so confident of you . That was your fault . You made me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>I think you could have made me love you if you had n't been so confident .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>I trusted you . You had told me . I knew I should never change , and I thought I knew you would n't .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>I was wrong . I never did love you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Then why did you say —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking at him rather wistfully</stage>You 're rather charming , Gerald , you know , and you —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>turning away from her furiously</stage>Damn charming ! That 's what you all say . I 'm sick of it ! You think that if a man 's charming , that 's the end of him , and that all he 's good for is to amuse a few old ladies at a tea party . I 'm sick of it ! The rude rough man with the heart of gold — that 's the only sort that can have a heart at all , according to some of you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p><stage>utterly surprised by this</stage>Gerald !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>I 'm sorry , Pamela . Of course you would n't understand . But we were just talking .<stage>With a sudden disarming smile</stage>I do n't know whether an apology is overdoing the charm ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p><stage>in distress</stage>Oh , Gerald , you could n't really have loved me ; you do n't really now . Of course , it will hurt you , but you 'll soon get over it . Oh , what 's the good of my talking like this ? I 've never really known you ; I do n't know you now .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>quietly</stage>It 's no good now , anyway .<stage>He walks away from her and looks out through the windows at the back .</stage>Just tell me one or two things . Were you in love with him when he went to prison ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>I do n't know — really I do n't know . I was so dreadfully sorry for him all that time before , and I felt so very friendly towards him , so very — oh , Gerald , so motherly . And I wanted to be wanted so badly , and you did n't seem to want me in that way . That was why , when he had gone , I went right away from you , and asked you not to write to me ; I wanted to think it all out — alone .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>But you wrote to Bob ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , Gerald , he wanted it so badly .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>I 'm sorry .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>I wrote to him and he wrote to me . I met him when he came out — he told me when to come . I suppose I had decided by then ; we came down here to tell you . I had to come at once .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>You do love him , Pamela ? It is n't just pity ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>I do , Gerald ; I think I found that out this afternoon .</l>
        <stage>Timidly</stage>
        <l>Say you do n't hate me very much .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>I wish to God I could .... What are you and Bob going to do ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>Canada , as soon as we can . I 've got friends there . We 've a little money between us . Bob ought to have done it a long time ago .<stage>Coming up to him</stage>Just do one more nice thing for me before we go .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>moving away from her on pretence of getting a cigarette</stage>What is it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>Bob will want to see you before he goes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>I do n't want to see him .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>Ah , but you must .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>What have we got to say to each other ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>I do n't know , but I feel you must see him . Otherwise he 'll think that he ran away from you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>with a shrug</stage>All right . You 'll go back to London at once , I suppose ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>Yes . We hired a car . We left it outside at the gates . We did n't want to see anybody but you , if possible .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Father and mother are out . Aunt Harriet knows — oh , and Tommy and Letty — that Bob was coming to-day ; nobody else . But I can make up something . We 'll keep Tommy and Letty out of it for the moment . Of course , they 'll all have to know in the end .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>We 'll write , of course .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Yes . Tommy and Letty are engaged , by the way .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>Oh !<stage>Understanding how he must feel about it</stage>Oh , Gerald !<stage>She makes a movement towards him , but he takes no notice .</stage>I 'll send Bob to you ; he 's waiting outside , I expect .<stage>Timidly</stage>Good-bye , Gerald .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>still with his back to her</stage>Good-bye , Pamela .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>Wo n't you —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>from the bottom of his heart</stage>Go away , go away ! I can n't bear the sound of your voice ; I can n't bear to look at you . Go away !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PAMELA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , Gerald !<stage>She goes out .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <stage>GERALD looks up as she goes out , and then looks quickly down again . When BOB comes in he is still resting with his arm on the mantelpiece looking into the fire .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking up</stage>Hullo .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>Hullo .<stage>After a pause</stage>Is that all you 've got to say ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>I 've just seen Pamela .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>trying not to show his eagerness</stage>Well ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Well — is n't that enough ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>What do you mean ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>bitterly</stage>Do you want me to fall on , your neck , and say take her and be happy ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>You never loved her .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>That 's a lie , and anyhow we wo n't discuss it . She 's going to marry you , and that 's an end of it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>very eagerly</stage>She is going to ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>sharply</stage>Do n't you know it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>mumbling</stage>Yes , but she might — Ah , you could n't charm her away from me this time .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>with an effort</stage>I do n't know what you mean by “ this time . ” I think we 'd better leave Pamela out of it altogether . She 's waiting for you outside . Last time I offered to shake hands with you , you had some fancied grievance against me , and you would n't ; now if there 's any grievance between us , it 's on my side .<stage>Holding out his hand</stage>Good-bye , Bob , and — quite honestly — good luck .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>ignoring the hand</stage>Magnanimous Gerald !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>GERALD looks at him in surprise for a moment . Then he shrugs his shoulders , turns round , and goes back to the mantelpiece , and takes a cigarette from the box there .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>I 'm tired of you , Bob . If you do n't want me , I do n't want you .<stage>He sits down in a chair and lights his cigarette .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>And now I suppose you 're thoroughly pleased with yourself , and quite happy .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking at him in absolute wonder</stage>Happy ? You fool !<stage>Something in BOB 'S face surprises him , and he gets up and says</stage>Why do you suddenly hate me like this ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>with a bitter laugh</stage>Suddenly !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>almost frightened</stage>Bob !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>letting the jealousy that has been pent up for years come out at last</stage>You 're surprised ! Surprised ! You would be . You 've never stopped to think what other people are thinking ; you take it for granted that they all love you , and that 's all you care about . Do you think I liked playing second fiddle to you all my life ? Do you think I 've never had any ambitions of my own ? I suppose you thought I was quite happy being one of the crowd of admirers round you , all saying , “ Oh , look at Gerald , is n't he wonderful ? ”</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>astounded</stage>Bob , I had no idea — I never dreamt —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>They thought something of me when I was young . When I first went to school they thought something of me . I daresay even you thought something of me then ; I could come back in the holidays and tell you what school was like , and what a lot they thought of me . They did n't think much of me when you came ; you soon put a stop to that . I was just young Farringdon 's brother then , and when we came home together , all the talk was of the wonderful things Gerald had done . It was like that at Eton ; it was like that at Oxford . It 's always been like that . I managed to get away from you a bit after Oxford , but it went on just the same . “ How do you do , Mr. Farringdon ? Are you any relation to Gerald Farringdon ? ”<stage>With the utmost contempt</stage>And you actually thought I liked that ; you thought I enjoyed it . You thought I smiled modestly and said , “ Oh yes , he 's my brother , my young brother ; is n't he wonderful ? ”</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>hardly able to realise it</stage>And you 've felt like this for years ?<stage>To himself</stage>For years !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>not noticing him</stage>And that was n't enough for you . They got you into the Foreign Office — they could have got me there . They could have put me into the Army<stage>Almost shouting</stage>Are n't I the eldest son ? But no , it did n't matter about the eldest son — never mind about him ; put him in the City , anywhere as long as he 's out of the way . If we have any influence , we must use it for Gerald — the wonderful Gerald .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>If this is an indictment , it 's drawn against the wrong person .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>more quietly</stage>Then at last I found a friend ; somebody who took me for my own sake .<stage>Bitterly</stage>And like a damned fool I brought her down here , and she saw you . I might have known what would happen .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Pamela !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>Yes , and you took her . After taking everything you could all your life , you took her . She was Bob 's friend — that was quite enough . She must be one more in the crowd of admirers round you . So you took her .<stage>Triumphantly</stage>Ah , but I got her back in the end . I 've got her now — and I think I 'm square , Gerald .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Yes , I think you 're square now .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>rather jauntily , as he leans back against the end of the sofa and feels for his cigarette-case</stage>I seem to have surprised you rather .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>You 've thought like that about me for years and you 've never said anything ? You 've felt like that about Pamela and you 've never said anything ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>I 've been thinking it over , particularly these last few months — in prison , Gerald . You have a lot of time for thinking in prison . Oh , I know ; you advised me to stand on my head and waggle my legs in the air — something like that . You were full of brilliant ideas . I had a better idea — I thought .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>realising his state of mind</stage>My God , what a time you must have had !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>furiously</stage>Damn you ! I wo n't be pitied by you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>coolly</stage>And you 're not going to be . You 've talked about yourself and thought about yourself quite long enough ; now I 'm going to talk about myself .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>And it wo n't be the first time either .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>quickly</stage>It will be the first time to you . You say I 've never tried to understand your feelings — have you ever tried to understand mine ? My God , Bob ! I 've thought a good deal more about you than you have about me . Have I ever talked about myself to you ? When a boy does well at school he likes talking about it ; did I ever bore you with it ? Never ! Because I knew how you 'd feel about it . I knew how I 'd feel about it , and so I tried to make it easy for you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>Very noble of you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>angrily</stage>Do n't be such a damned fool , Bob . What 's the good of talking like that ? If whatever I do is wrong , then you 're only convicting yourself ; you 're not convicting me . According to you , if I talk about myself I 'm being conceited and superior , and if I do n't talk about myself , I 'm being noble and still more superior . In fact , whatever I do , I can n't please you . That does n't condemn me ; it condemns yourself .<stage>Wearily</stage>What 's the good of talking ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>Go on ; I like to hear it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Very well . We 'll take the definite accusations first . Apart from the general charge of being successful — whatever that amounts to — you accuse me of two things . One you did n't mention just now , but it was more or less obvious the last time I saw you . That was that I neglected to help you when you were in trouble , and that through me you went to prison .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p>Yes , I forgot that this time .<stage>With an unpleasant laugh</stage>But I did n't forget it in prison .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>You had a sense of humour once , Bob . I do n't know what 's happened to it lately . Do n't you think it 's rather funny to hate a person steadily for fifteen years , judge all his acts as you 'd hardly judge those of your bitterest enemy , and yet , the first time you are in trouble , to expect him to throw everything on one side and rush to your help — and then to feel bitterly ill-used if he does n't ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>rather taken aback</stage>I — you did n't — I did n't —</p>
      </sp>

       <p><stage>quietly</stage>That 's been rather like you all through , Bob . You were always the one who had to be helped ; you were always the one who was allowed to have the grievance . Still , that does n't make it any better for me if I could have helped you and did n't . However , I 'm quite certain that I could n't have helped you then . We 'll take the other accusation , that I stole Pamela from you . I 've only got two things to say to that . First , that Pamela was not engaged to you , and was perfectly free to choose between us . Secondly , that you never told me , and I had n't the slightest idea , that you were the least bit fond of her . Indeed , I do n't believe you realized it yourself at that time .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>rather shamefaced</stage>I 've realized it since .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Yes , and you 've taken Pamela back since . I think if I were you I would keep her out of it .<stage>BOB looks away and GERALD goes on</stage>Now we come to the general charge , which seems to be<stage>very deliberately</stage>that I 'm better than you at games , that I 've got better manners than you , that I 'm cleverer than you — in fact , that I 'm superior to you in every outward way , and am only inferior to you in — well , in the moral qualities .<stage>Quietly</stage>Bob , what are these moral qualities in which I am so deficient and you so endowed ? You judge me by the qualities I am supposed to have shown to you ; now what have you shown to me ? Have you been generous , have you been friendly , have you been sympathetic ? No ; you 've just told me that for fifteen years you 've hated me and been jealous of me . Things have been rotten for you , I admit ; have you ever tried to make the best of them ? You 've had disadvantages to fight against ; have you ever fought against them ? Never ! You 've turned every trouble into a grievance , and hoarded it up . I said just now I was sick of you . I am — utterly . You said just now you did n't want my pity . You have n't got it ; you 've only got my contempt ....<stage>He turns away , and then suddenly turns back , and , holding out his hand to BOB , says utterly unexpectedly</stage>And now , damn you ! will you shake hands ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>incoherent with surprise</stage>What do you — I — you did n't —<stage>GERALD 'S hand is still held out , and he is smiling .</stage>Oh , Jerry !<stage>He takes the hand .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>That 's all right . Good-bye , Bob , and good luck .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOB</speaker>
       <p><stage>bewildered</stage>Good-bye .<stage>He tuns round and goes towards the door . Half-way there , he looks over his shoulder and says awkwardly</stage>Had rather a rotten time in prison .<stage>GERALD nods . At the door BOB says</stage>Pamela and I —</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>With rather a forced smile , GERALD nods again , and BOB goes out .</stage>
      <stage>Left alone , GERALD stands looking into the fire and thinking . He tries sitting down to see if that will make thinking any pleasanter ; then he tries standing up again . He goes to the door in front of the staircase and opens it to see if there is anybody there ; then he goes to the windows at the back and looks through them . Evidently he sees somebody , for he beckons and then returns to his old place by the fire . In a few moments LETTY and TOMMY come in .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p><stage>excitedly</stage>I say , has Bob come ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Why ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p>I could have sworn we saw him just now as we were coming in . At least , Letty swore she did —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LETTY</speaker>
       <p>I know I did .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p>So I gave him a shout , but he fairly trekked off . Was it Bob ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Yes . Now look here , I want you to be two nice people . Do n't say anything to anybody . He came , but he did n't want to see the whole crowd of us . He 's going to Canada . I 'll do all the explaining , if you two just say nothing . Do you see ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LETTY</speaker>
       <p>Of course , Gerald .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p>Rather , old boy . Besides , it will make it much better for Letty and me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LETTY</speaker>
       <p>No rival attraction , Tommy means .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>Enter SIR JAMES and LADY FARRINGDON from the outer hull , having just returned from their lunch .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <p>Ah ! here you all are .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Had a good lunch ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <p>Lunch was all right , but the people were dull , very dull .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>There were one or two nice ones , I thought , dear . They all knew about you , Gerald .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p><stage>proudly</stage>Of course they would .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <p>Oh , one or two were all right , but he was — well , I was discussing shorthorns with him after lunch , and he hardly seemed interested at all . Dull , very dull . I 've got no use for that sort of man .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>During this speech the Butler has come in with a telegram for GERALD .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>taking it</stage>Just a moment .<stage>He reads it quickly .</stage>No answer .<stage>Exit Butler .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <stage>GERALD reads his telegram again more thoughtfully .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>From Pamela , dear ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>From the office . I shall have to go up at once .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p><stage>very disappointed</stage>Oh , Gerald !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <p>Something on ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Rather an important thing really . I never thought I should get it , but there was just a chance .<stage>Looking at his watch</stage>Oh , I can do it comfortably .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <p><stage>obviously proud that GERALD is in the thick of things</stage>What is it ? I suppose you must n't tell us .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Something abroad .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <p>Diplomatic mission , eh ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LETTY</speaker>
       <p>That does sound so frightfully exciting .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p><stage>proudly</stage>Oh , Gerald !<stage>Thoughtfully</stage>I wish we had known about it this morning , we could have mentioned it at lunch .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <p>That ought to lead to something .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p>Yes . I think it will . It 's rather an opportunity :</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>They are all round him now , just as they have always been . The buzz begins .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SIR JAMES</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Aha ! you 'll be an ambassador yet . What do you think of that ,</l>
        <l>Letty ?</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LETTY</speaker>
       <p>Well done , Gerald .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY FARRINGDON</speaker>
       <p>How like you , Gerald !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TOMMY</speaker>
       <p>Good old Gerald ! I never knew such a chap . You really are !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
       <p><stage>softly</stage>I wish I were n't , Tommy ! Oh , I wish I were n't !</p>

      <stage>They do n't hear him ; they are still buzzing .</stage>

      <stage>[ SCENE .— A room in UNCLE JAMES 'S house in the Cromwell Road . ]</stage>
      <stage>[ TIME .— The day after the War . ]</stage>
     </stage>
     <stage>Any room in UNCLE JAMES 'S house is furnished in heavy mid-Victorian style ; this particular morning-room is perhaps solider and more respectable even than the others , from the heavy table in the middle of it to the heavy engravings on the walls . There are two doors to it . The one at the back opens into the hall , the one at the side into the dining-room .</stage>
     <stage>PHILIP comes from the hall and goes into the dining-room . Apparently he finds nothing there , for he returns to the morning-room , looks about him for a moment and then rings the bell . It is ten o'clock , and he wants his breakfast . He picks up the paper , and sits in a heavy armchair in front of the fire — a pleasant-looking well-built person of twenty-three , with an air of decisiveness about him . MARY , the parlour-maid , comes in .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>Did you ring , Master Philip ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>absently</stage>Yes ; I want some breakfast , please , Mary .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>coldly</stage>Breakfast has been cleared away an hour ago .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Exactly . That 's why I rang . You can boil me a couple of eggs or something . And coffee , not tea .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>I 'm sure I do n't know what Mrs. Higgins will say ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>getting up</stage>Who is Mrs. Higgins ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>The cook . And she 's not used to being put about like this .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Do you think she 'll say something ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>I do n't know what she 'll say .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>You need n't tell me , you know , if you do n't want to . Anyway , I do n't suppose it will shock me . One gets used to it in the Army .<stage>He smiles pleasantly at her .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>Well , I 'll do what I can , sir . But breakfast at eight sharp is the master 's rule , just as it used to be before you went away to the war .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Before I went away to the war I did a lot of silly things . Do n't drag them up now .<stage>More curtly</stage>Two eggs , and if there 's a ham bring that along too .<stage>He turns away .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>doubtfully , as she prepares to go</stage>Well , I 'm sure I do n't know what Mrs. Higgins will say .<stage>Exit MARY .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <stage>As she goes out she makes way for AUNT EMILY to come in , a kind-hearted mid-Victorian lady who has never had any desire for the vote .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p>There you are , Philip ! Good-morning , dear . Did you sleep well ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Rather ; splendidly , thanks , Aunt Emily . How are you ?<stage>He kisses her .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p>And did you have a good breakfast ? Naughty boy to be late for it . I always thought they had to get up so early in the Army .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>They do . That 's why they 're so late when they get out of the</l>
       <l>Army .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p>Dear me ! I should have thought a habit of four years would have stayed with you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Every morning for four years , as I 've shot out of bed , I 've said to myself , “ Wait ! A time will come . ”<stage>Smiling</stage>That does n't really give a habit a chance .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p>Well , I daresay you wanted your sleep out . I was so afraid that a really cosy bed would keep you awake after all those years in the trenches .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Well , one is n't in the trenches all the time . And one gets leave — if one 's an officer .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p><stage>reproachfully</stage>You did n't spend much of it with us , Philip .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>taking her hands</stage>I know ; but you did understand , did n't you , dear ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p>We 're not very gay , and I know you must have wanted gaiety for the little time you had . But I think your Uncle James felt it . After all , dear , you 've lived with us for some years , and he is your guardian .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>I know . You 've been a darling to me always , Aunt Emily . But<stage>awkwardly</stage>Uncle James and I —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p>Of course , he is a little difficult to get on with . I 'm more used to him . But I 'm sure he really is very fond of you , Philip .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>H 'm ! I always used to be frightened of him .... I suppose he 's just the same . He seemed just the same last night — and he still has breakfast at eight o'clock . Been making pots of money , I suppose ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p>He never tells me exactly , but he did speak once about the absurdity of the excess-profits tax . You see , jam is a thing the Army wants .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>It certainly gets it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p>It was so nice for him , because it made him feel he was doing his bit , helping the poor men in the trenches .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Enter MARY .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>Mrs. Higgins wishes to speak to you , ma'am .<stage>She looks at PHILIP as much as to say , “ There you are ! ”</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p><stage>getting up</stage>Yes , I 'll come .<stage>To PHILIP</stage>I think I 'd better just see what she wants , Philip .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>firmly to MARY</stage>Tell Mrs. Higgins to come here .<stage>MARY hesitates and looks at her mistress .</stage>At once , please .<stage>Exit MARY .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p><stage>upset</stage>Philip , dear , I do n't know what Mrs. Higgins will say —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>No ; nobody seems to . I thought we might really find out for once .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p><stage>going towards the door</stage>Perhaps I 'd better go —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>putting his arm round her waist</stage>Oh no , you must n't . You see , she really wants to see me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p>You ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Yes ; I ordered breakfast five minutes ago .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p>Philip ! My poor boy ! Why did n't you tell me ? and I daresay I could have got it for you . Though I do n't know what Mrs. Higgins —</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>An extremely angry voice is heard outside , and MRS. HIGGINS , stout and aggressive , comes in .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>HIGGINS<stage>truculently</stage>You sent for me , ma'am ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p><stage>nervously</stage>Yes — er — I think if you — perhaps —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>calmly</stage>I sent for you , Mrs. Higgins . I want some breakfast . Did n't Mary tell you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>HIGGINS . Breakfast is at eight o'clock . It always has been as long as I 've been in this house , and always will be until I get further orders .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Well , you 've just got further orders . Two eggs , and if there 's a ham —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>HIGGINS . Orders . We 're talking about orders . From whom in this house do I take orders , may I ask ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>In this case from me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>HIGGINS<stage>playing her trump-card</stage>In that case , ma'am , I wish to give a month 's notice from to-day . Inclusive .</p>

      <p><stage>quickly , before his aunt can say anything</stage>Certainly . In fact , you 'd probably prefer it if my aunt gave you notice , and then you could go at once . We can easily arrange that .<stage>TO AUNT EMILY as he takes out a fountain pen and cheque-book</stage>What do you pay her ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p><stage>faintly</stage>Forty-five pounds .</p>

      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>writing on his knee</stage>Twelves into forty-five ....<stage>Pleasantly to MRS. HIGGINS , but without looking up</stage>I hope you do n't mind a Cox 's cheque . Some people do ; but this is quite a good one .<stage>Tearing it out</stage>Here you are .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>HIGGINS<stage>taken aback</stage>What 's this ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Your wages instead of notice . Now you can go at once .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>HIGGINS . Who said anything about going ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>surprised</stage>I 'm sorry ; I thought you did .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>HIGGINS . If it 's only a bit of breakfast , I do n't say but what I might n't get it , if I 'm asked decent .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>putting back the cheque</stage>Then let me say again , “ Two eggs , ham and coffee . ” And Mary can bring the ham up at once , and I 'll get going on that .<stage>Turning away</stage>Thanks very much .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>HIGGINS . Well , I — well — well !<stage>Exit speechless .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>surprised</stage>Is that all she ever says ? It is n't much to worry about .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p>Philip , how could you ! I should have been terrified .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Well , you see , I 've done your job for two years out there .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p>What job ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Mess President .... I think I 'll go and see about that ham .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He smiles at her and goes out into the dining-room . AUNT EMILY wanders round the room , putting a few things tidy as is her habit , when she is interrupted by the entrance of UNCLE JAMES . JAMES is not a big man , nor an impressive one in his black morning-coat ; and his thin straggly beard , now going grey , does not hide a chin of any great power ; but he has a severity which passes for strength with the weak .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>Philip down yet ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p>He 's just having his breakfast .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>looking at his watch</stage>Ten o'clock .<stage>Snapping it shut and putting it back</stage>Ten o'clock . I say ten o'clock , Emily .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p>Yes , dear , I heard you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>You do n't say anything ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p><stage>vaguely</stage>I expect he 's tired after that long war .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>That 's no excuse for not being punctual . I suppose he learnt punctuality in the Army ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p>I expect he learnt it , James , but I understood him to say that he 'd forgotten it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>Then the sooner he learns it again the better . I particularly stayed away from the office to-day in order to talk things over with him , and<stage>looking cat his watch</stage>here 's ten o'clock — past ten — and no sign of him . I 'm practically throwing away a day .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p>What are you going to talk to him about ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>His future , naturally . I have decided that the best thing he can do is to come into the business at once .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p>Are you really going to talk it over with him , James , or are you just going to tell him that he must come ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>surprised</stage>What do you mean ? What 's the difference ? Naturally we shall talk it over first , and — er — naturally he 'll fall in with my wishes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p>I suppose he can hardly help himself , poor boy .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>Not until he 's twenty-five , anyhow . When he 's twenty-five he can have his own money and do what he likes with it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p><stage>timidly</stage>But I think you ought to consult him at little , dear . After all , he has been fighting for us .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>with his back to the fire</stage>Now that 's the sort of silly sentiment that there 's been much too much of . I object to it strongly . I do n't want to boast , but I think I may claim to have done my share . I gave up my nephew to my country , and I — er — suffered from the shortage of potatoes to an extent that you probably did n't realize . Indeed , if it had n't been for your fortunate discovery about that time that you did n't really like potatoes , I do n't know how we should have carried on . And , as I think I 've told you before , the excess-profits tax seemed to me a singularly stupid piece of legislation — but I paid it . And I do n't go boasting about how much I paid .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p><stage>unconvinced</stage>Well , I think that Philip 's four years out there have made him more of a man ; he does n't seem somehow like a boy who can be told what to do . I 'm sure they 've taught him something .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>I 've no doubt that they 've taught him something about — er — bombs and — er — which end a revolver goes off , and how to form fours . But I do n't see that that sort of thing helps him to decide upon the most suitable career for a young man in after-war conditions .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p>Well , I can only say you 'll find him different .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>I did n't notice any particular difference last night .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p>I think you 'll find him rather more — I can n't quite think of the word , but Mrs. Higgins could tell you what I mean .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>Of course , if he likes to earn his living any other way , he may ; but I don t see how he proposes to do it so long as I hold the purse-strings .<stage>Looking at his watch</stage>Perhaps you 'd better tell him that I cannot wait any longer .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>EMILY opens the door leading into the dining-room and talks through it to PHILIP .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p>Philip , your uncle is waiting to see you before he goes to the office . Will you be long , dear ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>from the dining-room</stage>Is he in a hurry ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>shortly</stage>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p>He says he is rather , dear .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Could n't he come and talk in here ? It would n't interfere with my breakfast .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>No .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p>He says he 'd rather you came to him , darling .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>resigned</stage>Oh , well .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p><stage>to JAMES</stage>He 'll be here directly , dear . Just sit down in front of the fire and make yourself comfortable with the paper . He wo n't keep you long .<stage>She arranges him .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>taking the paper</stage>The morning is not the time to make oneself comfortable . It 's a most dangerous habit . I nearly found myself dropping off in front of the fire just now . I do n't like this hanging about , wasting the day .<stage>He opens the paper .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p>You should have had a nice sleep , dear , while you could . We were up so late last night listening to Philip 's stories .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>Yes , yes .<stage>He begins a yawn and stifles it hurriedly .</stage>You must n't neglect your duties , Emily . I 've no doubt you have plenty to do .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p>All right , James , then I 'll leave you . But do n't be hard on the boy .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>sleepily</stage>I shall be just , Emily ; you can rely upon that .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EMILY</speaker>
      <p><stage>going to the door</stage>I do n't think that 's quite what I meant .<stage>She goes out .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <stage>JAMES , who is now quite comfortable , begins to nod . He wakes up with a start , turns over the paper , and nods again . Soon he is breathing deeply with closed eyes .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>coming in</stage>Sorry to have kept you waiting , but I was a bit late for breakfast .<stage>He takes out his pipe .</stage>Are we going to talk business or what ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>taking out his match</stage>A bit late ! I make it just two hours .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>pleasantly</stage>All right , Uncle James . Call it two hours late . Or twenty-two hours early for tomorrow 's breakfast , if you like .<stage>He sits down in a chair on the opposite side of the table from his uncle , and lights his pipe .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>You smoke now ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>staggered</stage>I what ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>nodding at his pipe</stage>You smoke ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Good heavens ! what did yolk think we did in France ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>Before you start smoking all over the house , I should have thought you would have asked your aunt 's permission .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>PHILIP looks at him in amazement , and then goes to the door .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>calling</stage>Aunt Emily !... Aunt Emily !... Do you mind my smoking in here ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>AUNT EMILY</speaker>
      <p><stage>from upstairs</stage>Of course not , darling .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>to JAMES , as he returns to his chair</stage>Of course not , darling .<stage>He puts back his pipe in his mouth .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>Now , understand once and for all , Philip , while you remain in my house I expect not only punctuality , but also civility and respect . I will not have impertinence .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>unimpressed</stage>Well , that 's what I want to talk to you about , Uncle James . About staying in your house , I mean .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>I do n't know what you do mean .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Well , we do n't get on too well together , and I thought perhaps I 'd better take rooms somewhere . You could give me an allowance until I came into my money . Or I suppose you could give me the money now if you really liked . I do n't quite know how father left it to me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>coldly</stage>You come into your money when you are twenty-five . Your father very wisely felt that to trust a large sum to a mere boy of twenty-one was simply putting temptation in his way . Whether I have the power or not to alter his dispositions , I certainly do n't propose to do so .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>If it comes to that , I am twenty-five .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>Indeed ? I had an impression that that event took place in about two years ’ time . When did you become twenty-five , may I ask ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>quietly</stage>It was on the Somme . We were attacking the next day and my company was in support . We were in a so-called trench on the edge of a wood — a damned rotten place to be , and we got hell . The company commander sent back to ask if we could move . The C. O . said , “ Certainly not ; hang on . ” We hung on ; doing nothing , you know — just hanging on and waiting for the next day . Of course , the Boche knew all about that . He had it on us nicely ....<stage>Sadly</stage>Dear old Billy ! he was one of the best — our company commander , you know . They got him , poor devil ! That left me in command of the company . I sent a runner back to ask if I could move . Well , I 'd had a bit of a scout on my own and found a sort of trench five hundred yards to the right . Not what you 'd call a trench , of course , but compared to that wood — well , it was absolutely Hyde Park . I described the position and asked if I could go there . My man never came back . I waited an hour and sent another man . He went west too . Well , I was n't going to send a third . It was murder . So I had to decide . We 'd lost about half the company by this time , you see . Well , there were three things I could do — hang on , move to this other trench , against orders , or go back myself and explain the situation .... I moved .... And then I went back to the C. O . and told him I 'd moved .... And then I went back to the company again ....<stage>Quietly</stage>That was when I became twenty-five .... or thirty-five .... or forty-five .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>recovering himself with an effort</stage>Ah yes , yes .<stage>He coughs awkwardly .</stage>No doubt points like that frequently crop up in the trenches . I am glad that you did well out there , and I 'm sure your Colonel would speak kindly of you ; but when it comes to choosing a career for you now that you have left the Army , my advice is not altogether to be despised . Your father evidently thought so , or he would not have entrusted you to my care .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>My father did n't foresee this war .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>Yes , yes , but you make too much of this war . All you young boys seem to think you 've come back from France to teach us our business . You 'll find that it is you who 'll have to learn , not we .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>I 'm quite prepared to learn ; in fact , I want to .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>Excellent . Then we can consider that settled .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Well , we have n't settled yet what business I 'm going to learn .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>I do n't think that 's very difficult . I propose to take you into my business . You 'll start at the bottom of course , but it will be a splendid opening for you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>thoughtfully</stage>I see . So you 've decided it for me ? The jam business .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>sharply</stage>Is there anything to be ashamed of in that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Oh no , nothing at all . Only it does n't happen to appeal to me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>If you knew which side your bread was buttered , it would appeal to you very considerably .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>I 'm afraid I can n't see the butter for the jam .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>I do n't want any silly jokes of that sort . You were glad enough to get it out there , I 've no doubt .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Oh yes . Perhaps that 's why I 'm so sick of it now .... No , it 's no good , Uncle James ; you must think of something else .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a sneer</stage>Perhaps you 've thought of something else ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Well , I had some idea of being an architect —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>You propose to start learning to be an architect at twenty-three ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>smiling</stage>Well , I could n't start before , could I ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>Exactly . And now you 'll find it 's too late .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Is it ? Are n't there going to be any more architects , or doctors , or solicitors , or barristers ? Because we 've all lost four years of our lives , are all the professions going to die out ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>And how old do you suppose you 'll be before you 're earning money as an architect ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>The usual time , whatever that may be . If I 'm four years behind , so is everybody else .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>Well , I think it 's high time you began to earn a living at once .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Look here , Uncle James , do you really think that you can treat me like a boy who 's just left school ? Do you think four years at the front have made no difference at all ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>If there had been any difference , I should have expected it to take the form of an increased readiness in obey orders and recognize authority .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>regretfully</stage>You are evidently determined to have a row . Perhaps I had better tell you once and for all that I refuse to go into the turnip and vegetable narrow business .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>thumping the table angrily</stage>And perhaps I 'd better tell you , sir , once and for all , that I do n't propose to allow rude rudeness from an impertinent young puppy .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>reminiscently</stage>I remember annoying our Brigadier once . He was covered with red , had a very red face , about twenty medals , and a cold blue eye . He told me how angry he was for about five minutes while I stood to attention . I 'm afraid you are n't nearly impressive , Uncle James .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>rather upset</stage>Oh !<stage>Recovering himself</stage>Fortunately I have other means of impressing you . The power of the purse goes a long way in this world . I propose to use it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>I see .... Yes ... that 's rather awkward , is n't it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>pleasantly</stage>I think you 'll find it very awkward .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>thoughtfully</stage>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>With an amused laugh JAMES settles down to his paper as if the interview were over .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>to himself</stage>I suppose I shall have to think of another argument .<stage>He takes out a revolver from him pocket and fondles it affectionately .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>looking up suddenly as he is doing this — amazed</stage>What on earth are you doing ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Souvenir from France . Do you know , Uncle . James , that this revolver has killed about twenty Germans ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>shortly</stage>Oh ! Well , do n't go playing about with it here , or you 'll be killing Englishmen before you know where you are .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Well , you never know .<stage>He raises it leisurely and points it at his uncle .</stage>It 's a nice little weapon .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>angrily</stage>Put it down , sir . You ought to have grown out of monkey tricks like that in the Army . You ought to know better than to point an unloaded revolver at anybody . That 's the way accidents always happen .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Not when you 've been on a revolver course and know all about it . Besides , it is loaded .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>very angry because he is frightened suddenly</stage>Put it down at once , sir .<stage>PHILIP turns it away from him and examines it carelessly .</stage>What 's the matter with you ? Have you gone mad suddenly ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>mildly</stage>I thought you 'd be interested in it . It 's shot such a lot of Germans .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>Well , it wo n't want to shoot any more , and the sooner you get rid of it the better .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>I wonder . Does it ever occur to you , Uncle James , that there are about a hundred thousand people in England who own revolvers , who are quite accustomed to them and — who have nobody to practise on now ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>No , sir , it certainly does n't .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>thoughtfully</stage>I wonder if it will make any difference . You know , one gets so used to potting at people . It 's rather difficult to realize suddenly that one ought n't to .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>getting up</stage>I do n't know what the object of this tomfoolery is , if it has one . But you understand that I expect you to come to the office with me to-morrow at nine o'clock . Kindly see that you 're punctual .<stage>He turns to go away .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>softly</stage>Uncle James .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>over his shoulder</stage>I have no more —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>in his parade voice</stage>Damn it , sir ! stand to attention when you talk to an officer !<stage>JAMES instinctively turns round and stiffens himself .</stage>That 's better ; you can sit down if you like .<stage>He motions JAMES to his chair with the revolver .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>going nervously to his chair</stage>What does this bluff mean ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>It is n't bluff , it 's quite serious .<stage>Pointing the revolver at his uncle</stage>Do sit down .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>sitting donor</stage>Threats , eh ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Persuasion .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>At the point of the revolver ? You settle your arguments by force ? Good heavens , sir ! this is just the very thing that we were fighting to put down .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>We were fighting ! We ! We ! Uncle , you 're humorist .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>, Well , “ you , ” if you prefer it . Although those of us who stayed at home —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Yes , never mind about the excess profits now . I can tell you quite well what we fought for . We used force to put down force . That 's what I 'm doing now . You were going to use force — the force of money — to make me do what you wanted . Now I 'm using force to stop it .<stage>He levels the revolver again .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>You 're — you 're going to shoot your old uncle ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Why not ? I 've shot lots of old uncles — Landsturmers .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>But those were Germans ! It 's different shooting Germans . You 're in England now . You could n't have a crime on your conscience like that .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Ah , but you must n't think that after four years of war one has quite the same ideas about the sanctity of human life . How could one ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>You 'll find that juries have kept pretty much the same ideas , I fancy .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Yes , but revolvers often go off accidentally . You said so yourself . This is going to be the purest accident . Ca n't you see it in the papers ? “ The deceased 's nephew , who was obviously upset — ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>I suppose you think it 's brave to come back from the front and threaten a defenceless man with a revolver ? Is that the sort of fair play they teach you in the Army ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Good heavens ! of course it is . You do n't think that you wait until the other side has got just as many guns as you before you attack ? You 're really rather lucky . Strictly speaking , I ought to have thrown half a dozen bombs at you first .<stage>Taking one out of his pocket</stage>As it happens , I 've only got one .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>thoroughly alarmed</stage>Put that back at once .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>putting down the revolver and taking it in his hands</stage>You hold it in the right hand — so — taking care to keep the lever down . Then you take the pin in the finger — so , and — but perhaps this does n't interest you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>edging his chair away</stage>Put it down at once , sir . Good heavens ! anything might happen .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>putting it down and taking up the revolver again</stage>Does it ever occur to you , Uncle James , that there are about three million people in England who know all about bombs , and how to throw them , and —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>It certainly does not occur to me . I should never dream of letting these things occur to me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>looking at the bomb regretfully</stage>It 's rather against my principles as a soldier , but just to make things a bit more fair —<stage>generously</stage>you shall have it .<stage>He holds it out to him suddenly .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>shrinking back again</stage>Certainly not , sir . It might go off at any moment .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>putting it back in his pocket</stage>Oh no ; it 's quite useless ; there 's no detonator ....<stage>Sternly</stage>Now , then , let 's talk business .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>What do you want me to do ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Strictly speaking , you should be holding your hands over your head and saying “ Kamerad ! ” However , I 'll let you off that . All I ask from you is that you should be reasonable .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>And if I refuse , you 'll shoot me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Well , I do n't quite know , Uncle James . I expect we should go through this little scene again to-morrow . You have n't enjoyed it , have you ? Well , there 's lots more of it to come . We 'll rehearse it every day . One day , if you go on being unreasonable , the thing will go off . Of course , you think that I should n't have the pluck to fire . But you can n't be quite certain . It 's a hundred to one that I sha n't — only I might . Fear — it 's a horrible thing . Elderly men die of it sometimes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>Pooh ! I 'm not to be bluffed like that .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>suddenly</stage>You 're quite right ; you 're not that sort . I made a mistake .<stage>Aiming carefully</stage>I shall have to do it straight off , after all . One — two —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>on his knees , with uplifted hands , in an agony of terror</stage>Philip ! Mercy ! What are your terms ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>picking him up by the scruff , and helping him into the chair</stage>Good man , that 's the way to talk . I 'll get them for you . Make yourself comfortable in front of the fire till I come back . Here 's the paper .<stage>He gives his uncle the paper , and goes out into the hall .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <stage>JAMES opens his eyes with a start and looks round him in a bewildered way . He rubs his heart , takes out his match and looks at it , and then stares round the room again . The door from the dining-room opens , and PHILIP comes in with a piece of toast in his hand .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>his mouth full</stage>You wanted to see me , Uncle James ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>still bewildered</stage>That 's all right , my boy , that 's all right . What have you been doing ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>surprised</stage>Breakfast .<stage>Putting the last piece in his mouth</stage>Rather late , I 'm afraid .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>That 's all right .<stage>He laughs awkwardly .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Anything the matter ? You do n't look your usual bright self .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>I — er — seem to have dropped asleep in front of the fire . Most unusual thing for me to have done . Most unusual .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Let that be a lesson to you not to get up so early . Of course , if you 're in the Army you can n't help yourself . Thank Heaven I 'm out of it , and my own master again .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>Ah , that 's what I wanted to talk to you about . Sit down , Philip .<stage>He indicates the chair by the fire .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>taking a chair by the table</stage>You have that , uncle ; I shall be all right here .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>hastily</stage>No , no ; you come here .<stage>He gives PHILIP the armchair and sits by the table himself .</stage>I should be dropping off again .<stage>He laughs awkwardly .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Righto .<stage>He puts his hand to his pocket . UNCLE JAMES shivers and looks at him to horror . PHILIP brings out his pipe , and a sickly grin of relief comes into JAMES 'S face .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>I suppose you smoked a lot in France ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Rather ! Nothing else to do . It 's allowed in here ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>hastily</stage>Yes , yes , of course .<stage>PHILIP lights his pipe .</stage>Well now , Philip , what are you going to do , now you 've left the Army ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>promptly</stage>Burn my uniform and sell my revolver .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>starting at the word “ revolver ”</stage>Sell your revolver , eh ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>surprised</stage>Well , I do n't want it now , do I ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>No .... Oh no .... Oh , most certainly not , I should say . Oh , I can n't see why you should want it at all .<stage>With an uneasy laugh</stage>You 're in England now . No need for revolvers here — eh ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>staring at him</stage>Well , no , I hope not .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>hastily</stage>Quite so . Well now , Philip , what next ? We must find a profession for you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>yawning</stage>I suppose so . I have n't really thought about it much .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>You never wanted to be an architect ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>surprised</stage>Architect ?<stage>JAMES rubs his head and wonders what made him think of architect .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>Or anything like that .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>It 's a bit late , is n't it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>Well , if you 're four years behind , so is everybody else .<stage>He feels vaguely that he has heard this argument before .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>smiling</stage>To tell the truth , I do n't feel I mind much anyway . Anything you like — except a commissionaire . I absolutely refuse to wear uniform again .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>How would you like to come into the business ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>The jam business ? Well , I do n't know . You would n't want me to salute you in the mornings ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>My dear boy , no !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>All right , I 'll try it if you like . I do n't know if I shall be any good — what do you do ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>It 's your experience in managing and — er — handling men which I hope will be of value .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Oh , I can do that all right .<stage>Stretching himself luxuriously</stage>Uncle James , do you realize that I 'm never going to salute again , or wear a uniform , or get wet — really wet , I mean — or examine men 's feet , or stand to attention when I 'm spoken to , or — oh , lots more things . And best of all , I 'm never going to be frightened again . Have you ever known what it is to be afraid — really afraid ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>embarrassed</stage>I — er — well —<stage>He coughs .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>No , you could n't — not really afraid of death , I mean . Well , that 's over now . Good lord ! I could spend the rest of my life in the British Museum and be happy ....</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>getting up</stage>All right , we 'll try you in the office . I expect you want a holiday first , though .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>getting up</stage>My dear uncle , this is holiday . Being in London is holiday . Buying an evening paper — wearing a waistcoat again — running after a bus — anything — it 's all holiday .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>All right , then , come along with me now , and I 'll introduce you to Mr. Bamford .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p>Right . Who 's he ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p>Our manager . A little stiff , but a very good fellow . He 'll be delighted to hear that you are coming into the firm .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
      <p><stage>smiling</stage>Perhaps I 'd better bring my revolver , in case he is n't .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
      <p><stage>laughing with forced heartiness as they go together to the door</stage>Ha , ha ! A good joke that ! Ha , ha , ha ! A good joke — but only a joke , of course . Ha , ha ! He , he , he !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>PHILIP goes out . JAMES , following him , turns at the door , and looks round the room in a bewildered way . Was it a dream , or was n't it ? He will never be quite certain .</stage>

      <stage>It is a lovely April afternoon — a foretaste of summer — in BELINDA 'S garden .</stage>
      <stage>BETTY , a middle-aged servant , is fastening a hammock — its first appearance this year — between two trees at the back . In front of these there is a solid oak garden-table , with a comfortable chair on the right of it and a straight-backed one on the left . There are books , papers , and magazines on the table . BELINDA , of whom we shall know more presently , is on the other side of the open windows which look on to the garden , talking to BETTY .</stage>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
       <p><stage>coming to front of hammock</stage>Yes , ma'am ; I think it 's firm .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Because I 'm not the fairy I used to be .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
       <p><stage>trying the knots at the other end of the hammock</stage>Yes , ma'am ; it 's quite firm this end too .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>It 's not the ends I 'm frightened of ; it 's the middle where the weight 's coming .<stage>She comes into the garden .</stage>It looks very nice .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
       <p>Yes , ma'am .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>trying the middle of it with her hand</stage>I asked them at the Stores if they were quite sure it would bear me , and they said it would take anything up to — I forget how many tons . I know I thought it was rather rude of them .<stage>Looking at it anxiously</stage>How does one get in ? So trying to be a sailor !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
       <p>I think you sit in it , ma'am , and then<stage>explaining with her hands</stage>throw your legs over .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>I see .<stage>She sits gingerly in the hammock , and then , with a sudden flutter of white , does what BETTY suggests .</stage>Yes .<stage>Regretfully .</stage>I 'm afraid that was rather wasted on you , Betty . We must have some spectators next time .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
       <p>Yes , ma'am .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Cushions .<stage>She arranges them at her back with BETTY 'S help . With a sigh of comfort</stage>There ! Now then , Betty , about callers .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
       <p>Yes , ma'am .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>If Mr. Baxter calls — he is the rather prim gentleman —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
       <p>Yes , ma'am ; the one who 's been here several times before .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>giving BETTY a quick look</stage>Yes . Well , if he calls , you 'll say , “ Not at home . ”</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
       <p>Yes , ma'am .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>He will say , “ Oh — er — oh — er — really . ” Then you 'll smile very sweetly and say , “ I beg your pardon , was it Mr. Baxter ? ” And he 'll say , “ Yes ! ” and you 'll say , “ Oh , I beg your pardon , sir ; this way , please . ”</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
       <p>Yes , ma'am .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>That 's right , Betty . Well now , if Mr. Devenish calls — he is the rather poetical gentleman —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
       <p>Yes , ma'am ; the one who 's always coming here .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>with a pleased smile</stage>Yes . Well , if he calls you 'll say , “ Not at home . ”</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
       <p>Yes , ma'am .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>He 'll immediately throw down his bunch of flowers and dive despairingly into the moat . You 'll stop him , just as he is going in , and say , “ I beg your pardon , sir , was it Mr. Devenish ? ” And he will say , “ Yes ! ” and you will say , “ Oh , I beg your pardon , sir ; this way , please . ”</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
       <p>Yes , ma'am . And suppose they both call together ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>We wo n't suppose anything so exciting , Betty .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
       <p>No , ma'am . And suppose any other gentleman calls ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>with a sigh</stage>There are n't any other gentlemen .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
       <p>It might be a clergyman , come to ask for a subscription like .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>If it 's a clergyman , Betty , I shall — I shall want your assistance out of the hammock first .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
       <p>Yes , ma'am .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>That 's all . To anybody else I 'm not at home .<stage>Trying to secure book on table and nearly falling out of the hammock .</stage>Oh , just give me that little green book .<stage>Pointing to books on the table .</stage>The one at the bottom there — that 's the one .<stage>BETTY gives it to her .</stage>Thank you .<stage>Reading the title .</stage>“ The Lute of Love , ” by Claude Devenish .<stage>To herself as she turns the pages .</stage>It does n't seem much for half-a-crown when you think of the Daily Telegraph . ... Lute ... Lute .... I should have quite a pretty mouth if I kept on saying that .<stage>With a great deal of expression .</stage>Lute !<stage>She pats her mouth back .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
       <p>Is that all , ma'am ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>That 's all .<stage>BETTY prepares to go .</stage>Oh , what am I thinking of !<stage>Waving to the table .</stage>I want that review ; I think it 's the blue one .<stage>As BETTY begins to look .</stage>It has an article by Mr. Baxter on the “ Rise of Lunacy in the Eastern Counties ” — yes , that 's the one . I 'd better have that too ; I 'm just at the most exciting place . You shall have it after me , Betty .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
       <p>Is that all , ma'am ?</p>

       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Yes , that really is all .</p>

       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>reading to herself</stage>“ It is a matter of grave concern to all serious students of social problems — ”<stage>Putting the review down in hammock and shaking her head gently .</stage>But not in April .<stage>Lazily opening the book and reading .</stage>“ Tell me where is love ” — well , that 's the question , is n't it ?<stage>She puts the book down , gives a sigh of happiness , and lazily closes her eyes . DELIA comes into the garden , from Paris . She is decidedly a modern girl , pretty and self-possessed . Her hair is half-way up ; waiting for her birthday , perhaps . She sees her mother suddenly , stops , and then goes on tiptoe to the head of the hammock . She smiles and kisses her mother on the forehead . BELINDA , looking supremely unconscious , goes on sleeping . DELIA kisses her lightly again . BELINDA wakes up with an extraordinarily natural start , and is just about to say , “ Oh , Mr. Devenish — you must n't ! ” — when she sees DELIA .</stage>Delia !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Well , mummy , are n't you glad to see me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>My darling child !<stage>They kiss each other frantically .</stage></p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Say you 're glad .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>sitting up</stage>My darling , I 'm absolutely — Hold the hammock while I get out , dear ; we do n't want an accident .<stage>Getting out with DELIA 'S help</stage>They 're all right when you 're there , and they 'll bear two tons , but they 're horrid getting in and out of .<stage>Kissing her again</stage>Darling , it really is you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , it is jolly seeing you again . I believe you were asleep .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>with dignity</stage>Certainly not , child . I was reading “ The Nineteenth Century ” —<stage>with an air</stage>— and after .<stage>Earnestly</stage>Darling , was n't it next Thursday you were coming back ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>No , this Thursday , silly .</p>

       <p><stage>penitently</stage>Oh , my darling , and I was going over to Paris to bring you home .</p>

       <p>So confusing their both being called Thursday . And you were leaving school for the very last time . If you do n't forgive me , Delia , I shall cry .</p>

       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Is n't it a lovely day for April , darling ! I 've wanted to say that to somebody all day , and you 're the first person who 's given me the chance . Oh , I said it to Betty , but she only said , “ Yes , ma'am . ”</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Poor mother !</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>jumping up suddenly and kissing DELIA again</stage>I simply must have another one . And to think that you 're never going back to school any more .<stage>Looking at her fondly</stage>Darling , you are looking pretty .</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>

       <p><stage>excitedly , at she slips off the table</stage>Mummy , I believe you 're being bad again .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Really , darling , you forget that I 'm old enough to be — in fact , am — your mother .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>with a sigh</stage>And I was just going to ask you how you were getting on with your French .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Bother French ! You 've been having a much more interesting time than I have , so you 've got to tell .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>with a happy sigh</stage>O-oh !<stage>She sinks back into her chair .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Is it like the Count at Scarborough ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>surprised and pained</stage>My darling , what do you mean ?</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>reproachfully</stage>Dear one , you were the merest child , paddling about on the beach and digging castles .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>smiling to herself</stage>I was old enough to notice the Count .</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>And then there was the M. P . who proposed at Windermere .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Yes , dear , but it was n't seconded — I mean he never got very far with it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>And the artist in Wales .</p>

       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Darling child , what a memory you have . No wonder your teachers are pleased with you .</p>

        <l>Devonshire in April before .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Is it really serious this time ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>pained</stage>I wish you would n't say this time , Delia . It sounds so unromantic . If you 'd only put it into French — cette fois — it sounds so much better .

      </sp>

       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Now you 're being too French , darling .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Why , do you still think father may be alive ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Why not ? It 's only eighteen years since he left us , and he was quite a young man then .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Yes , but surely you 'd have heard from him in all those years , if he 'd been alive ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Well , he has n't heard from me , and I 'm still alive .</p>

       <p>Were you as heavenly when you were young as you are now ?</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>rather crossly</stage>I wish you would n't keep on saying he left me . I left him too .</p>

       <p>Why ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>smiling to herself</stage>Well , you see , he was quite certain he knew how to manage women , and I was quite certain I knew how to manage men .<stage>Thoughtfully .</stage>If only one of us had been certain , it would have been all right .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>seriously</stage>What really happened , mummy ? I 'm grown up now , so I think you ought to tell me .</p>

       <p>Yes , dear , it was ; but he never would see it . He took it quite seriously .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>And did you say dramatically , “ If you really loved me , you 'd take it off ” ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>apologetically</stage>I 'm afraid I did , darling .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>And what did he say ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>He said — very rudely — that , if I loved him , I 'd do my hair in a different way .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>How ridiculous !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>touching her hair</stage>Of course , I did n't do it like this then .<stage>With a sigh .</stage>I suppose we never ought to have married , really .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Why did you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Mother rather wanted it .<stage>Solemnly .</stage>Delia , never get married because your mother — Oh , I forgot ; I 'm your mother .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>And I do n't want a better one .... And so you left each other ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>But , darling , did n't you tell him there was going to be a Me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Oh no !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>I wonder why not ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Well , you see , if I had , he might have wanted to stay .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>But —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>hurt</stage>If he did n't want to stay for me , I did n't want him to stay for you .<stage>Penitently .</stage>Forgive me , darling , but I did n't know you very well then .<stage>DELIA jumps off the table and hugs her mother impetuously .</stage>We 've been very happy together , have n't we ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>going back to her seat</stage>I should think we have .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>I do n't want to deny you anything , and , of course , if you 'd like a stepfather<stage>looking down modestly</stage>or two —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , you have been enjoying yourself .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Only you see how awkward it would be if Jack turned up in the middle of the wedding , like — like Eugene Aram .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Enoch Arden , darling .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>It 's very confusing their having the same initials . Perhaps I 'd better call them both E. A. in future and then I shall be safe . Well , anyhow it would be awkward , darling , would n't it ? Not that I should know him from Adam after all these years — except for a mole on his left arm .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Perhaps Adam had a mole .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>No , darling ; you 're thinking of Noah . He had two .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>thoughtfully</stage>I wonder what would happen if you met somebody whom you really did fall in love with ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>reproachfully</stage>Now you 're being serious , and it 's April .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Are n't these two — the present two — serious ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Oh no ! They think they are , but they are n't a bit , really . Besides , I 'm doing them such a lot of good . I 'm sure they 'd hate to marry me , but they love to think they 're in love with me , and — I love it , and — and they love it , and — and we all love it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>You really are the biggest , darlingest baby who ever lived .<stage>Kisses her .</stage>Do say I sha n't spoil your lovely times .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>surprised</stage>Spoil them ? Why , you 'll make them more lovely than ever .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Well , but do they know you have a grown-up daughter ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>suddenly realizing</stage>Oh !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>It does n't really matter , because you do n't look a day more than thirty .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>absently</stage>No .<stage>Hurriedly .</stage>I mean , how sweet of you — only —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>What !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>playing with her rings</stage>Well , one of them , Mr. Baxter — Harold —<stage>she looks quickly up at DELIA and down again in pretty affectation , but she is really laughing at herself all the time</stage>he writes statistical articles for the Reviews — percentages and all those things . He 's just the sort of man , if he knew that I was your mother , to work it out that I was more than thirty . The other one , Mr. Devenish — Claude —<stage>she looks up and down as before</stage>he 's rather , rather poetical . He thinks I came straight from heaven — last week .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>jumping up</stage>I think I 'd better go straight back to Paris .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>jumping up and catching her firmly by the arms</stage>You will do nothing of the sort . You will take off that hat —<stage>she lets go of the arm and begins to take out the pin</stage>which is a perfect duck , and I do n't know why I did n't say so before —<stage>she puts the hat down on the table</stage>and let me take a good look at you<stage>she does so</stage>, and kiss you<stage>she does so</stage>, and then we 'll go to your room and unpack and have a lovely talk about clothes . And then we 'll have tea .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>BETTY comes in .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>And now here 's Betty coming in to upset all our delightful plans , just when we 've made them .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>How are you , Betty ? I 've left school .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
       <p>Very nicely , thank you , miss . You 've grown .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>patting the top of DELIA 'S head</stage>I 'm much taller than she is .... Well , Betty , what is it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
       <p>The two gentlemen , Mr. Baxter and Mr. Devenish , have both called together , ma'am .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>excited</stage>Oh ! How — how very simultaneous of them !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>eagerly</stage>Oh , do let me see them !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Darling , you 'll see plenty of them before you 've finished .</l>
        <stage>To BETTY</stage>
        <l>What have you done with them ?</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
       <p>They 're waiting in the hall , ma'am , while I said I would see if you were at home .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>All right , Betty . Give me two minutes and then show them out here .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
       <p>Yes , ma'am .<stage>Exit .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>They can n't do much harm to each other in two minutes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>taking her hat</stage>Well , I 'll go and unpack . You really wo n't mind my coming down afterwards ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Of course not .<stage>A little awkwardly</stage>Darling one , I wonder if you 'd mind — just at first — being introduced as my niece . You see , I expect they 're in a bad temper already , having come here together , and we do n't want to spoil their day entirely .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>smiling</stage>I 'll be your mother if you like .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Oh no , that would n't do , because then Mr. Baxter would feel that he ought to ask your permission before paying his attentions to me . He 's just that sort of man . A niece is so safe — however good you are at statistics , you can n't really prove anything .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>All right , mummy .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>enjoying herself</stage>You 'd like to be called by a different name , would n't you ? There 's something so thrilling about taking a false name . Such a lot of adventures begin like that . How would you like to be Miss Robinson , darling ? It 's a nice easy one to remember .<stage>Persuasively .</stage>And you shall put your hair up so as to feel more disguised . What fun we 're going to have !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>You baby ! All right , then , I 'm Miss Robinson , your favourite niece .<stage>She moves towards the house .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>How sweet of you ! Oh , I 'm coming with you to do your hair . You do n't think you 're going to be allowed to do it yourself , when so much depends on it , and husbands leave you because of it , and —<stage>They do in together .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <stage>BETTY comes from the other side of the house into the garden , followed by MR. BAXTER and MR. DEVENISH . MR. BAXTER is forty-five , prim and erect , with close-trimmed moustache and side-whiskers . His clothes are dark and he wears a bowler-hat . MR. DEVENISH is a long-haired , good-looking boy in a négligé costume ; perhaps twenty-two years old , and very scornful of the world .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking about her surprised</stage>The mistress was here a moment ago . I expect she 'll be back directly , if you 'll just wait .<stage>She goes back into the house .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MR. BAXTER puts his bowler-hat firmly on his head and sits down very stiffly and upright in a chair on the left-hand side of the table . DEVENISH throws his felt hat on to the table and walks about inquisitively . He sees the review in the hammock and picks it up .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Good heavens , Baxter , she 's been reading your article !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>I dare say she 's not the only one .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>That 's only guesswork<stage>going to back of table</stage>; you do n't know of anyone else .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>How many people , may I ask , have bought your poems ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>loftily</stage>I do n't write for the mob .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>I think I may say that of my own work .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Baxter , I do n't want to disappoint you , but I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that you are one of the mob .<stage>Annoyed .</stage>Dash it ! what are you doing in the country at all in a bowler-hat ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>If I wanted to be personal , I could say , “ Why do n't you get your hair cut ? ” Only that form of schoolboy humour does n't appeal to me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>This is not a personal matter ; I am protesting on behalf of nature . What do the birds and the flowers and the beautiful trees think of your hat ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>If one began to ask oneself what the birds thought of things —<stage>He pauses .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Well , and why should n't one ask oneself ? It is better than asking oneself what the Stock Exchange thinks of things .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Well<stage>looking up at DEVENISH 'S extravagant hair</stage>, it 's the nesting season . Your hair !<stage>Suddenly .</stage>Ha ! ha ! ha ! ha ! ha ! ha !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>hastily smoothing it down</stage>Really , Baxter , you 're vulgar .<stage>He turns away and resumes his promenading . Suddenly he sees his book on the grass beneath the hammock and makes a dash for it .</stage>Ha , my book !<stage>Gloating over it</stage>Baxter , she reads my book .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>I suppose you gave her a copy .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>exultingly</stage>Yes , I gave her a copy . My next book will be hers and hers alone .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Then let me say that , in my opinion , you took a very great liberty .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Liberty ! And this from a man who is continually forcing his unwelcome statistics upon her .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>At any rate , I flatter myself that there is no suggestion of impropriety in anything that I write .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>I 'm not so sure about that , Baxter .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>What do you mean , sir ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Did you read The Times this month on the new reviews !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Well !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Oh , nothing . It just said , “ Mr. Baxter 's statistics are extremely suggestive . ” I have n't read them , so of course I do n't know what you 've been up to .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>turning away in disgust</stage>Pah !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Poor old Baxter !<stage>He wanders about the garden again , and , having picked a flower , comes to rest against one of the trees from which the hammock is swung . He leans against this and regards the flower thoughtfully .</stage>Baxter —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>crossly</stage>I wish you would n't keep calling me “ Baxter . ”</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>It is only by accident — an accident which we both deplore — that we have met at all , and in any case I am a considerably older man than yourself .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Mr. Baxter — father — I have a proposal to make . We will leave it to this beautiful flower to decide which of us the lady loves .</p>

      </sp>
      <stage>She gives her left hand to DEVENISH , who kisses it , and her right to BAXTER , who shakes it .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>How nice of you both to come !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Mr. Devenish and I are inseparable — apparently .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>You have n't told me what you were doing , Mr. Devenish . Was it</l>
        <l>“ This year , next year ? ” or “ Silk , satin — ”</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>My lady , it was even more romantic than that . I have the honour to announce to your ladyship that Mr. Baxter is to be a sailor .</p>

       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>He 'll grow out of it . I did .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , I hope not . I love talking nonsense , and I 'm ever so old .<stage>As they both start forward to protest</stage>Now which one of you will say it first ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>You are as old as the stars and as young as the dawn .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>You are ten years younger than I am .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>What sweet things to say ! I do n't know which I like best .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Where will my lady sit ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>I will recline in the hammock , an it please thee , my lord — only it 's rather awkward getting in , Mr. Baxter . Perhaps you 'd both better look at the tulips for a moment .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Oh — ah — yes .<stage>He puts his hat on and turns his back to the hammock .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>leaning over her</stage>If only —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>You 'd better not say anything , Mr. Devenish . Keep it for your next volume .<stage>He turns away .</stage>One , two , three — that was better than last time .<stage>They turn round to see her safely in the hammock . DEVENISH leans against the tree at her feet , and BAXTER draws the chair from the right side of the table and turns it round towards her . He presses his hat more firmly on and sits down .</stage>I wonder if either of you can guess what I 've been reading this afternoon !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking at her lovingly</stage>I know .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>giving him a fleeting look</stage>How did you know ?<stage>to BAXTER</stage>Yes , Mr. Baxter , it was your article I was reading . If you 'd come five minutes earlier you 'd have found me wrestling — I mean revelling in it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>I am very greatly honoured , Mrs. Tremayne . Ah — it seemed to me a very interesting curve showing the rise and fall of —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>I had n't got up to the curves . They are interesting , are n't they ? They are really more in Mr. Devenish 's line .<stage>To DEVENISH .</stage>Mr. Devenish , it was a great disappointment to me that all the poems in your book seemed to be written to somebody else .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>It was before I met you , lady . They were addressed to the goddess of my imagination . It is only in these last few weeks that I have discovered her .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>And discovered she was dark and not fair .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>She will be dark in my next volume .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , how nice of her !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>kindly</stage>You should write a real poem to Mrs. Tremayne .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>excitedly</stage>Oh do ! “ To Belinda . ” I do n't know what rhymes , except cinder . You could say your heart was like a cinder — all burnt up .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>pained</stage>Oh , my lady , I 'm afraid that is a cockney rhyme .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>How thrilling ! I 've never been to Hampstead Heath .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>“ Belinda . ” It is far too beautiful to rhyme with anything but itself .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Fancy ! But what about Tremayne ?<stage>Singing .</stage>Oh , I am Mrs. Tremayne , and I do n't want to marry again .</p>

       <p><stage>pointing excitedly to BAXTER</stage>There , that 's the first time he 's called me Belinda !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Are you serious ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Not as a rule .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>You 're not going to marry again ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Well , who could I marry ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>and BAXTER<stage>together</stage>Me !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>dropping her eyes modestly</stage>But this is England .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Mrs. Tremayne , I claim the right of age — of my greater years — to speak first .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Mrs. Tremayne , I —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>kindly to DEVENISH</stage>You can speak afterwards , Mr. Devenish . It 's so awkward when you both speak together .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Mrs. Tremayne , I am a man of substantial position , and perhaps I may say of some repute in serious circles . All that I have , whether of material or mental endowment , I lay at your feet , together with an admiration which I cannot readily put into words . As my wife I think you would be happy , and I feel that with you by my side I could achieve even greater things .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>How sweet of you ! But I ought to tell you that I 'm no good at figures .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>protesting</stage>My lady —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>I do n't mean what you mean , Mr. Devenish . You wait till it 's your turn .<stage>To BAXTER .</stage>Yes ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>I ask you to marry me , Belinda .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>settling herself happily and closing her eyes</stage>O-oh !... Now it 's your turn , Mr. Devenish .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>excitedly</stage>Money — thank Heaven , I have no money . Reputation — thank Heaven , I have no reputation . What can I offer you ? Dreams — nothing but dreams . Come with me and I will show you the world through my dreams . What can I give you ? Youth , freedom , beauty —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Debts .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>still with her eyes shut</stage>You must n't interrupt , Mr. Baxter .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Belinda , marry me and I will open your eyes to the beauty of the world . Come to me !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>happily</stage>O-oh ! You 've got such different ways of putting things . How can I choose between you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Then you will marry one of us ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>You know I really ought n't to .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>I do n't see why not .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Well , there 's just a little difficulty in the way .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>What is it ? I will remove it . For you I could remove anything — yes , even Baxter .<stage>He looks at BAXTER , who is sitting more solidly than ever in his chair .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>And anyhow I should have to choose between you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>in a whisper</stage>Choose me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>stiffly</stage>Mrs. Tremayne does not require any prompting . A fair field and let the best man win .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>going across to and slapping the astonished BAXTER on the back</stage>Aye , let the best man win ! Well spoken , Baxter .<stage>To BELINDA</stage>Send us out into the world upon some knightly quest , lady , and let the victor be rewarded .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>I — er — ought to say that I should be unable to go very far . I have an engagement to speak at Newcastle on the 21st .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Baxter , I will take no unfair advantage of you . Let the beard of the Lord Mayor of Newcastle be the talisman that my lady demands ; I am satisfied .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>This sort of thing is entirely contrary to my usual mode of life , but I will not be outfaced by a mere boy .<stage>Slapping his bowler-hat on the table</stage>I am prepared .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Speak , lady .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>speaking in a deep , mysterious voice</stage>Gentlemen , ye put wild thoughts into my head . In sooth , I am minded to send ye forth upon a quest that is passing strange . Know ye that there is a maid journeyed hither , hight Robinson — whose —<stage>in her natural voice</stage>what 's the old for aunt ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>hopefully</stage>Mother 's sister .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>You know , I think I shall have to explain this in ordinary language . You wo n't mind very much , will you , Mr. Devenish ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>It is the spirit of this which matters , not the language which clothes it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , I 'm so glad you think so . Well , now about Miss Robinson . She 's my niece and she 's just come to stay with me , and — poor girl — she 's lost her father . Absolutely lost him . He disappeared ever such a long time ago , and poor Miss Robinson — Delia — naturally wants to find him . Poor girl ! she can n't think where he is .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>nobly</stage>I will find him .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , thank you , Mr. Devenish ; Miss Robinson would be so much obliged .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Yes — er — but what have we to go upon ? Beyond the fact that his name is Robinson —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>I should n't go on that too much . You see , he may easily have changed it by now . He was never very much of a Robinson . Nothing to do with Peter or any of those .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>I will find him .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Well , can you tell us what he 's like ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Well , it 's such a long time since I saw him .<stage>Looking down modestly .</stage>Of course , I was quite a girl then . The only thing I know for certain is that he has a mole on his left arm about here .<stage>She indicates a spot just below the elbow .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>folding his arms and looking nobly upwards</stage>I will find him .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>I am bound to inform you , Mrs. Tremayne , that even a trained detective could not give you very much hope in such a case . However , I will keep a look-out for him , and , of course , if —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Fear not , lady , I will find him .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>annoyed</stage>Yes , you keep on saying that , but what have you got to go on ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>grandly</stage>Faith ! The faith which moves mountains .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Yes , and this is only just one small mole-hill , Mr. Baxter .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Yes , but still —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>S'sh ! here is Miss Robinson . If Mr. Devenish will hold the hammock while I alight — we do n't want an accident — I can introduce you .<stage>He helps her to get out .</stage>Thank you . Delia darling , this is Mr. Baxter ,— and Mr. Devenish . My niece , Miss Robinson —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>How do you do ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Miss Robinson has just come over from France . Mon Dieu , quel pays !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>I hope you had a good crossing , Miss Robinson .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , I never mind about the crossing . Aunt Belinda —<stage>She stops and smiles .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Yes , dear ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>I believe tea is almost ready . I want mine , and I 'm sure Mr. Baxter 's hungry . Mr. Devenish scorns food , I expect .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>hurt</stage>Why do you say that ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Are n't you a poet ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Yes , darling , but that does n't prevent him eating . He 'll be absolutely lyrical over Betty 's sandwiches .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>You wo n't deny me that inspiration , I hope , Miss Robinson .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Well , let 's go and see what they 're like .<stage>DELIA and DEVENISH begin to move towards the house .</stage>Mr. Baxter , just a moment .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Yes ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>secretly</stage>Not a word to her about Mr. Robinson . It must be a surprise for her .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Quite so , I understand .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>That 's right .<stage>Raising her voice .</stage>Oh , Mr. Devenish .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Yes , Mrs. Tremayne ?<stage>He comes back .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>secretly</stage>Not a word to her about Mr. Robinson . It must be a surprise for her .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Of course ! I should n't dream —<stage>Indignantly .</stage>Robinson ! What an unsuitable name !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>BAXTER and DELIA are just going into the house .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>dismissing DEVENISH</stage>All right , I 'll catch you up .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>DEVENISH goes after the other two .</stage>
      <stage>Left alone , BELINDA laughs happily to herself , and then begins to look rather aimlessly about her . She picks up her sunshade and opens it . She comes to the hammock , picks out her handkerchief , says , “ Ah , there you are ! ” and puts it away . She goes slowly towards the house , turns her head just as she comes to the door , and comes slowly back again . She stops at the table looking down the garden .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>to herself</stage>Have you lost yourself , or something ? No ; the latch is this side .... Yes , that 's right .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>TREMAYNE comes in . He has been knocking about the world for eighteen years , and is very much a man , though he has kept his manners . His hair is greying a little at the sides , and he looks the forty-odd that he is . Without his moustache and beard he is very different from the boy BELINDA married .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>with his hat in his hand</stage>I 'm afraid I 'm trespassing .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>winningly</stage>But it 's such a pretty garden<stage>turns away , dosing her parasol</stage>, is n't it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>rather confused</stage>I-I beg your pardon , I-er —<stage>He is wondering if it can possibly be she . BELINDA thinks his confusion is due to the fact that he is trespassing , and hastens to put him at his ease .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>I should have done the same myself , you know .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>pulling himself together</stage>Oh , but you must n't think I just came in because I liked the garden —</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>with that happy sigh of hers</stage>O-oh !... Now tell me what really did happen ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>I was on my way to Marytown —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>To where ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>Marytown .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , you mean Mariton .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>Do I ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Yes ; we always call it Mariton down here .<stage>Earnestly .</stage>You do n't mind , do you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>smiling</stage>Not a bit .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Just say it — to see if you 've got it right .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>Mariton .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>shaking her head</stage>Oh no , that 's quite wrong . Try it again<stage>With a rustic accent .</stage>Mariton .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>Mariton .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Yes , that 's much better ....<stage>As if it were he who had interrupted .</stage>Well , do go on .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>I 'm afraid it is n't much of an apology really . I saw what looked like a private road , but what I rather hoped was n't , and — well , I thought I 'd risk it . I do hope you 'll forgive me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Oh , but I love people seeing my garden . Are you staying in</l>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>I think so . Oh yes , decidedly .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Well , perhaps the next time the road wo n't feel so private .</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>I 'm afraid I could n't . Thank you so much for not minding . Well , I must be getting on , I have trespassed quite enough .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>regretfully</stage>And you have n't really seen the garden yet .</p>

       <p>If you wo n't mind my going on this way , I shall see some more on my way out .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Please do . It likes being looked at .<stage>With the faintest suggestion of demureness</stage>All pretty things do .</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>I wonder if you 'd mind very much if I called one day to thank you formally for the lesson you gave me in pronunciation ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>gravely</stage>Yes . I almost think you ought to . I think it 's the correct thing to do .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>contentedly</stage>Thank you very much , Mrs. Tremayne .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>You 'll come in quite formally by the front-door next time , wo n't you , because — because that seems the only chance of my getting to know your name .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , I beg your pardon . My name is — er — er — Robinson .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>laughing</stage>How very odd !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>startled</stage>Odd ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Yes ; we have someone called Robinson staying in the house . I wonder if she is any relation ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>hastily</stage>Oh no , no . No , she could n't be . I have no relations called Robinson — not to speak of .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>holding out her hand</stage>You must tell me all about your relations when you come and call , Mr. Robinson .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>I think we can find something better worth talking about than that .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Do you think so ?<stage>He says “ Yes ” with his eyes , bows , and goes off down the garden . BELINDA stays looking after him , then gives that happy sigh of hers , only even more so</stage>O-oh !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>Enter BETTY .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
       <p>If you please , ma'am , Miss Delia says , are you coming in to tea ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking straight in front of her , and taking no notice of BETTY , in a happy , dreamy voice</stage>Betty ,... about callers .... If Mr. Robinson calls — he 's the handsome gentleman who has n't been here before — you will say , “ Not at home . ” And he will say , “ Oh ! ” And you will say , “ I beg your pardon , sir , was it Mr. Robinson ? ” And he will say , “ Yes ! ” And you will say , “ Oh , I beg your pardon , sir — ”<stage>Almost as if she were BETTY , she begins to move towards the house .</stage>“ This way — ”<stage>she would be smiling an invitation over her shoulder to MR. ROBINSON , if he were there , and she were BETTY</stage>— “ please ! ”<stage>And the abandoned woman goes in to tea .</stage></p>

      <head type="act">ACT II</head>
      <stage>It is morning in BELINDA 'S hall , a low-roofed , oak-beamed place , comfortably furnished as a sitting-room . There is an inner and an outer front-door , both of which are open .</stage>
      <stage>DEVENISH , who has just rung the bell , is waiting with a bouquet of violets between the two . Midway on the right is a door leading to a small room where hats and coats are kept . A door on the left leads towards the living-rooms .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
       <p>Good morning , sir .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Good morning . I am afraid this is an unceremonious hour for a call , but my sense of beauty urged me hither in defiance of convention .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
       <p>Yes , sir .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>holding up his bouquet to BETTY</stage>See , the dew is yet lingering upon them ; how could I let them wait until this afternoon ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
       <p>Yes , sir ; but I think the mistress is out .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>They are not for your mistress ; they are for Miss Delia .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
       <p>Oh , I beg your pardon , sir . If you will come in , I 'll see if I can find her .<stage>She brings him in and goes away to find DELIA .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <stage>DEVENISH tries a number of poses about the room for himself and his bouquet , and finally selects one against the right side of the door by which he has just come in .</stage>
      <stage>Enter DELIA from the door on the left .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>shutting the door and going to DEVENISH</stage>Oh , good morning , Mr. Devenish . I 'm afraid my — er — aunt is out .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>I know , Miss Delia , I know .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>She 'll be so sorry to have missed you . It is her day for you , is n't it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Her day for me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Yes ; Mr. Baxter generally comes to-morrow , does n't he ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Miss Delia , if our friendship is to progress at all , it can only be on the distinct understanding that I take no interest whatever in Mr. Baxter 's movements .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , I 'm so sorry ; I thought you knew . What lovely flowers ! Are they for my aunt ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>To whom does one bring violets ? To modest , shrinking , tender youth .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>I do n't think we have anybody here like that .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>with a bow</stage>Miss Delia , they are for you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , how nice of you ! But I 'm afraid I ought n't to take them from you under false pretences ; I do n't shrink .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>A fanciful way of putting it , perhaps . They are none the less for you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Well , it 's awfully kind of you . I 'm afraid I 'm not a very romantic person . Aunt Belinda does all the romancing in our family .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Your aunt is a very remarkable woman .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>She is . Do n't you dare to say a word against her .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>My dear Miss Delia , nothing could be further from my thoughts . Why , am I not indebted to her for that great happiness which has come to me in these last few days ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>surprised</stage>Good gracious ! and I did n't know anything about it . But what about poor Mr. Baxter ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>stiffly</stage>I must beg that Mr. Baxter 's name be kept out of our conversation .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>But I thought Mr. Baxter and you — do tell me what 's happened . I seem to have lost myself .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>What has happened , Miss Delia , is that I have learnt at last the secret that my heart has been striving to tell me for weeks past . As soon as I saw that gracious lady , your aunt , I knew that I was in love . Foolishly I took it for granted that it was she for whom my heart was thrilling . How mistaken I was ! Directly you came , you opened my eyes , and now —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Mr. Devenish , you do n't say you 're proposing to me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>I am . I feel sure I am . Delia , I love you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>How exciting of you !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>with a modest shrug</stage>It 's nothing ; I am a poet .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>You really want to marry me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Such is my earnest wish .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>But what about my aunt ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>simply</stage>She will be my aunt-in-law .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>She 'll be rather surprised .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Delia , I will be frank with you . I admit that I made Mrs. Tremayne an offer of marriage .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>excitedly</stage>You really did ? Was it that first afternoon I came ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , I wish I 'd been there !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>with dignity</stage>It is not my custom to propose in the presence of a third party . It is true that on the occasion you mention a man called Baxter was on the lawn , but I regarded him no more than the old apple-tree or the flower-beds , or any other of the fixtures .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>What did she say ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>She accepted me conditionally .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , do tell me !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>It is rather an unhappy story . This man called Baxter in his vulgar way also made a proposal of marriage . Mrs. Tremayne was gracious enough to imply that she would marry whichever one of us fulfilled a certain condition .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>How sweet of her !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>It is my earnest hope , Miss Delia , that the man called Baxter will be the victor . As far as is consistent with honour , I shall endeavour to let Mr. Baxter<stage>banging the table with his hand</stage>win .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>What was the condition ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>That I am not at liberty to tell . It is , I understand , to be a surprise for you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>How exciting !... Mr. Devenish , you have been very frank . May I be equally so ?<stage>DEVENISH bows .</stage>Why do you wear your hair so long ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>pleased</stage>You have noticed it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Well , yes , I have .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>I wear it so to express my contempt for the conventions of so-called society .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>I always thought that people wore it very very short if they despised the conventions of society .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>I think that the mere fact that my hair annoys Mr. Baxter is sufficient justification for its length .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>But if it annoys me too ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>heroically</stage>It shall go .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>apologetically</stage>I told you I was n't a very romantic person , did n't I ?<stage>Kindly .</stage>You can always grow it again if you fall in love with somebody else .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>That is cruel of you , Delia . I shall never fall in love again .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>Enter BELINDA in a hat .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Why , it 's Mr. Devenish ! How nice of you to come so early in the morning ! How is Mr. Baxter ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>I do not know , Mrs. Tremayne .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>to DELIA</stage>I got most of the things , Delia .<stage>To DEVENISH .</stage>“ The things , ” Mr. Devenish , is my rather stuffy way of referring to all the delightful poems that you are going to eat to-night .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>I am looking forward to it immensely , Mrs. Tremayne .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>I do hope I 've got all your and Mr. Baxter 's favourite dishes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>I 'm afraid Mr. Baxter and I are not likely to appreciate the same things .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>coyly</stage>Oh , Mr. Devenish ! And you were so unanimous a few days ago .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>I think Mr. Devenish was referring entirely to things to eat .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>I felt quite sad when I was buying the lamb cutlets . To think that , only a few days before , they had been frisking about with their mammas , and having poems written about them by Mr. Devenish . There ! I 'm giving away the whole dinner . Delia , take him away before I tell him any more . We must keep some surprises for him .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>wickedly</stage>Are those my flowers , Mr. Devenish ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>after a little hesitation , with a bow which might refer to either of them</stage>They are for the most beautiful lady in the land .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , how nice of you !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>DEVENISH follows DELIA out through the door on the left .</stage>

       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>unpinning her hat before a mirror</stage>I suppose he means Delia — bless them !<stage>She gives a few pats to her hair and then walks about the room singing softly to herself . She does to the front-door and looks happily out into the garden . Suddenly she sees MR. BAXTER approaching . She hurries back into a chair and pretends to be very busy reading .</stage></p>

       <p>I must apologize for intruding upon you at this hour , Mrs. Tremayne .</p>

       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Before you begin — have you been seeing my niece lately ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>surprised</stage>No .</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Why , is she lost too ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Oh no ; I just — Do sit down . Let me put your hat down somewhere for you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>keeping it firmly in his hand , and sitting down on the sofa</stage>It will be all right here , thank you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>returning to her chair</stage>I 'm dying to hear what you are going to say .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>First as regards the use of your Christian name . I felt that , as a man of honour , I could not permit myself to use it until I had established my right over that of Mr. Devenish .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>All my friends call me Belinda .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>As between myself and Mr. Devenish the case is somewhat different . Until one of us is successful over the other in the quest upon which you have sent us , I feel that as far as possible we should hold aloof from you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>pleadingly</stage>Just say “ Belinda ” once more , in case you 're a long time .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>very formally</stage>Belinda .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>How nicely you say it — Harold .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>half getting out of his seat</stage>Mrs. Tremayne , I must not listen to this .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>meekly</stage>I wo n't offend again , Mr. Baxter . Please go on . Tell me about the quest ; are you winning ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>I am progressing , Mrs. Tremayne . Indeed , I came here this morning to acquaint you with the results of my investigations . Yesterday I located a man called Robinson working upon a farm close by . I ventured to ask him if he had any marks upon him by which he could be recognized . He adopted a threatening attitude , and replied that if I wanted any he could give me some . With the aid of half-a-crown I managed to placate him . Putting my inquiry in another form , I asked if he had any moles . A regrettable misunderstanding , which led to a fruitless journey to another part of the village , was eventually cleared up , and on my return I satisfied myself that this man was in no way related to your niece .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>admiringly</stage>How splendid of you ! Well , now , we know he 's not .<stage>She holds up one finger .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Yes . In the afternoon I located another Mr. Robinson following the profession of a carrier . My first inquiries led to a similar result , with the exception that in this case Mr. Robinson carried his threatening attitude so far as to take off his coat and roll up his sleeves . Perceiving at once that he was not the man , I withdrew .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>How brave you are ! That makes two .<stage>She holds up another finger</stage>It still leaves a good many .<stage>Pleadingly .</stage>Just call me Belinda again .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>nervously</stage>You must n't tempt me , Mrs. Tremayne .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>penitently</stage>I wo n't !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>To resume , then , my narrative . This morning I have heard of a third Mr. Robinson . Whether there is actually any particular fortune attached to the number three I cannot say for certain . It is doubtful whether statistics would be found to support the popular belief . But one likes to flatter oneself that in one 's own case it may be true ; and so —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>And so the third Mr. Robinson —?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Something for which I cannot altogether account inspires me with hope . He is , I have discovered , staying at Mariton . This afternoon I go to look for him .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>to herself</stage>Mariton ! How funny ! I wonder if it 's the same one .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>What one ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , just one of the ones .<stage>Gratefully .</stage>Mr. Baxter , you are doing all this for me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Pray do not mention it . I do n't know if it 's Devonshire , or the time of the year , or the sort of atmosphere you create , Mrs. Tremayne , but I feel an entirely different man . There is something in the air which — yes , I shall certainly go over to Mariton this afternoon .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>gravely</stage>I have had the same feeling sometimes , Mr. Baxter . I am not always the staid respectable matron which I appear to you to be . Sometimes I —<stage>She looks absently at the watch on her wrist .</stage>Good gracious !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>alarmed</stage>What is it !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking anxiously from the door to him</stage>Mr. Baxter , I 'm going to throw myself on your mercy .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>My dear Mrs. Tremayne —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking at her watch again</stage>A strange man will be here directly . He must not find you with me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>rising , jealously</stage>A man ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>excitedly</stage>Yes , yes , a man ! He is pursuing me with his attentions . If he found you here , there would be a terrible scene .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>I will defend you from him .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>No , no . He is a big man . He will — he will overpower you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>But you —?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>I can defend myself . I will send him away . But he must not find you here . You must hide before he overpowers you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>with dignity</stage>I will withdraw if you wish it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>No , not withdraw , hide . He might see you withdrawing .<stage>Leading the way to a door on the right</stage>Quick , in here .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>embarrassed at the thought that this sort of thing really only happens in a bedroom farce</stage>I do n't think I quite —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>reassuring him</stage>It 's perfectly respectable ; it 's where we keep the umbrellas .<stage>She takes him by the hand .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>still resisting</stage>I 'm not at all sure that I —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>earnestly</stage>Oh , but do n't you see what trust I 'm putting in you ? Some people are so nervous about their umbrellas .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Well , of course , if you — but I do n't see why I should n't just slip out of the door before he comes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>reproachfully</stage>Of course , if you grudge me every little pleasure — Quick ! Here he is .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>She bundles him through the door , and with a sigh of happiness comes back and looks at herself in the mirror . She goes to the front-door , moves her hand to somebody in the distance , and comes into the hall again . Seeing MR. BAXTER 'S bowler hat on the sofa , she carries across to his door , knocks , hands it to him , saying , “ Your hat . S'sh ! ” and returns to her chair . TREMAYNE comes in .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>at the door</stage>It 's no good your pretending to be surprised , because you said I could come .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>welcoming him</stage>But I can still be surprised that you wanted to come .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE O</speaker>
       <p>h no , you are n't .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>marking it off on her fingers</stage>Just a little bit — that much .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>It would be much more surprising if I had n't come .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>sitting down on the sofa</stage>It is a pretty garden , is n't it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>sitting down next to her</stage>You forget that I saw the garden yesterday .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , but the things have grown so much since then . Let me see , this is the third day you 've been and we only met three days ago . And then you 're coming to dinner again to-night .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>eagerly</stage>Am I ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Yes . Have n't you been asked ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>No , not a word .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Yes , that 's quite right ; I remember now , I only thought of it this morning , so I could n't ask you before , could I ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>earnestly</stage>What made you think of it then ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>romantically</stage>It was at the butcher 's . There was one little lamb cutlet left over and sitting out all by itself , and there was nobody to love it . And I said to myself , suddenly , “ I know , that will do for Mr. Robinson . ”<stage>Prosaically .</stage>I do hope you like lamb ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>I adore it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , I 'm so glad ! When I saw it sitting there I thought you 'd love it . I 'm afraid I can n't tell you any more about the rest of the dinner , because I would n't tell Mr. Devenish , and I want to be fair .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>Who 's Mr. Devenish ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , have n't you met him ? He 's always coming here .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE I</speaker>
       <p>s he in love with you too ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Too ? Oh , you mean Mr. Baxter .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>Confound it , that 's three !</p>
      </sp>

       <p>Who is Mr. Baxter ?</p>

       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , he 's a sort of statistician . Is n't that a horrid word to say ? So stishany .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>What does he make statistics about ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , umbrellas and things . Do n't let 's talk about him .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>All right , then ; who is Mr. Devenish ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , he 's a poet .<stage>She throws up her eyes and sighs deeply .</stage>Ah me !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>What does he write poetry about ?<stage>BELINDA looks at him , and down again , and then at him again , and then down , and gives a little sigh — all of which means , “ Ca n't you guess ? ”</stage>What does he write poetry about ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>obediently</stage>He wrote “ The Lute of Love and other Poems , by Claude Devenish . ” The Lute of Love —<stage>To herself .</stage>I have n't been saying that lately .<stage>With great expression .</stage>The Lute of Love — the Lute .<stage>She pats her mouth back .</stage></p>

       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>And what is Mr. Devenish —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>putting her hand on his sleeve</stage>You 'll let me know when it 's my turn , wo n't you ?</p>

       <p>Your turn ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Yes , to ask questions . I love this game — it 's like clumps .<stage>She crosses her hands on her lap and waits for the next question .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>I beg your pardon . I — er — of course have no right to cross-examine you like this .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , do go on , I love it .<stage>With childish excitement .</stage>I 've got my question ready .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>

      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>I think it 's a fair question . I met you three days ago and you told me you were staying at Mariton . Mariton . You can say it all right now , can n't you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>I think so .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>coaxingly</stage>Just say it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>Mariton .</p>

       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>clapping her hands</stage>Lovely ! I do n't think any of the villagers do it as well as that .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>Well ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Well , that was three days ago . You came the next day to see the garden , and you came the day after to see the garden , and you 've come this morning — to see the garden ; and you 're coming to dinner to-night , and it 's so lovely , we shall simply have to go into the garden afterwards . And all I know about you is that you have n't any relations called Robinson .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>What do I know about Mrs. Tremayne but that she has a relation called Robinson ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>And two dear friends called Devenish and Baxter .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>annoyed</stage>I was forgetting them .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>to herself</stage>I must n't forget Mr. Baxter .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>getting up</stage>But what does it matter ? What would it matter if I knew nothing about you ? I know everything about you — everything that matters .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>closing her eyes contentedly</stage>Tell me some of them .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>still with her eyes shut</stage>He 's going to propose to me . I can feel it coming .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>Confound it ! how many men have proposed to you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>surprised</stage>Since when ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>Since your first husband proposed to you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , I thought you meant this year .<stage>Sitting up .</stage>Well now , let me see .<stage>Slowly and thoughtfully .</stage>One .<stage>She pushes up her first finger .</stage>Two .<stage>She pushes up the second .</stage>Three .<stage>She pushes up the third finger , holds it there for a moment and then pushes it gently down again .</stage>No , I do n't think that one ought to count really .<stage>She pushes up two more fingers and the thumb .</stage>Three , four , five — do you want the names or just the total ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>This is horrible .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>innocently</stage>But anybody can propose . Now if you 'd asked how many I 'd accepted — Let me see , where was I up to ? I sha n't count yours , because I have n't really had it yet . Six , seven — Yes , Betty , what is it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>BETTY has just come in from the door on the left .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
       <p>If you please , ma'am , cook would like to speak to you for a minute .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>getting up</stage>Yes , I 'll come .<stage>To TREMAYNE .</stage>You 'll forgive me , wo n't you ? You 'll find some cigarettes there .<stage>She starts to go , but comes back and adds confidentially</stage>It 's probably about the lamb cutlets ; I expect your little one refuses to be cooked .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>She goes out after BETTY .</stage>
      <stage>Left alone , TREMAYNE stalks moodily about the room , occasionally kicking things which come in his way . He takes up his hat suddenly and goes towards the door ; stops irresolutely and comes back . He is standing in the middle of the room with his hands in his pockets when DEVENISH comes in from the door on the left .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>surprised</stage>Hullo !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE H</speaker>
       <p>ullo !... Are you Mr. Devenish ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>Devenish the poet ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>coming up and shaking him warmly by the hand</stage>My dear fellow , you know my work ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>grimly</stage>My dear Mr. Devenish , your name is most familiar to me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>I congratulate you . I thought your great-grandchildren would be the first to hear of me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>My name 's Robinson , by the way .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Then let me return the compliment , Robinson . Your name is familiar to me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>hastily</stage>I do n't think I 'm related to any Robinsons you know .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Well , no , I suppose not . When I was very much younger I began a collection of Robinsons . Actually it was only three days ago , but it seems much longer . Many things have happened since then .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>uninterested</stage>Really !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>There is a man called Baxter who is still collecting , I believe . For myself , I am only interested in one of the great family — Delia .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>eagerly</stage>You are interested in her ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Devotedly . In fact , I am at this moment waiting for her to put on her hat .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>warmly</stage>My dear Devenish , I am delighted to make your acquaintance .<stage>He seizes his hand and grips it heartily .</stage>How are you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>feeling his fingers</stage>Fairly well , thanks .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>That 's right .<stage>They sit on the sofa together .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>still nursing his hand</stage>You are a very lucky fellow , Robinson .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>In what way ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>People you meet must be so very reluctant to say good-bye to you . Have you ever tried strangling lions or anything like that ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>with a laugh</stage>Well , as a matter of fact , I have .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>I suppose you won all right ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>In the end , with the help of my beater .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Personally I should have backed you alone against any two ordinary lions .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>One was quite enough . As it was , he gave me something to remember him by .<stage>Putting up his left sleeve , he displays a deep scar .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking at it casually</stage>By Jove , that 's a nasty one !<stage>He suddenly catches sight of the mole and stares at it fascinated .</stage>Good heavens !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>What 's the matter ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>clasping his head</stage>Wait . Let me think .<stage>After a pause .</stage>Have you ever met a man called Baxter ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>No .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Would you like to ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>grimly</stage>Very much indeed .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>He 's the man I told you about who 's interested in Robinsons . He 'll be delighted to meet you .<stage>With a nervous laugh .</stage>Funny thing , he 's rather an authority on lions . You must show him that scar of yours ; it will intrigue him immensely .<stage>Earnestly .</stage>Do n't shake hands with him too heartily just at first ; it might put him off the whole thing .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>This Mr. Baxter seems to be a curious man .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DIVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>absently</stage>Yes , he is rather odd .<stage>Looking at his watch .</stage>I wonder if I —<stage>To TREMAYNE .</stage>I suppose you wo n't be —<stage>He stops suddenly . A slight tapping noise comes from the room where they keep umbrellas .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>What 's that !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>The tapping noise is repeated , a little more loudly this time .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Come in .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>The door opens and BAXTER comes in nervously , holding his bowler hat in his hand .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Oh , I just —<stage>TREMAYNE stands up</stage>— I just —<stage>He goes back again .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>springing across the room</stage>Baxter !<stage>The door opens nervously again and BAXTER 'S head appears round it .</stage>Come in , Baxter , old man ; you 're just the very person I wanted .<stage>BAXTER comes in carefully .</stage>Good man .<stage>To TREMAYNE</stage>This is Mr. Baxter that I was telling you about .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>much relieved at the appearance of his rival</stage>Oh , is this Mr. Baxter ?<stage>Holding out his hand with great friendliness</stage>How are you , Mr. Baxter ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>warningly</stage>Steady !<stage>TREMAYNE shakes BAXTER quite gently by the hand .</stage>Baxter , this is Mr. Robinson .<stage>Casually .</stage>R-o-b-i-n-s-o-n .<stage>He looks sideways at BAXTER to see how he takes it . BAXTER is noticeably impressed .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Really ? I am very glad to meet you , sir .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>Very good of you to say so .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>to BAXTER</stage>Robinson is a great big-game hunter .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Indeed ? I have never done anything in that way myself , but I 'm sure it must be an absorbing pursuit .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , well , it 's something to do .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>to BAXTER</stage>You must get him to tell you about a wrestle he had with a lion once . Extraordinary story !<stage>Looking at his watch suddenly .</stage>Jove ! I must be off . See you again , Baxter . Good-bye , Robinson . No , do n't shake hands . I 'm in a hurry .<stage>He looks at his watch again and goes out hurriedly by the door on the left .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <stage>TREMAYNE sit down together on the sofa .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>Unusual man , your friend Devenish . I suppose it comes of being a poet .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>I have no great liking for Mr. Devenish —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , he 's all right .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>But I am sure that if he is impressed by anything outside himself or his own works , it must be something rather remarkable . Pray tell me of your adventure with the lion .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>laughing</stage>Really , you must n't think that I go about telling everybody my adventures . It just happened to come up . I 'm afraid I shook his hand rather more warmly than I meant , and he asked me if I 'd ever tried strangling lions . That was all .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>And had you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>Well , it just happened that I had .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Indeed ! You came off scathless , I trust ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>carelessly indicating his arm</stage>Well , he got me one across there .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>obviously excited</stage>Really , really . One across there . Not bad , I hope ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>laughing</stage>Well , it does n't show unless I do that .<stage>He pulls up his sleeve carelessly and BAXTER bends eagerly over his arm .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Good heavens ! I 've found it !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>Found what ?<stage>He pulls down his sleeve .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>I must see Mrs. Tremayne . Where 's Mrs. Tremayne ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>She went out just now . What 's the matter ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Out ! I must find her . This is a matter of life and death .<stage>He seizes his hat and hurries out by the front door .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <stage>TREMAYNE stares after him in amazement . Then he pulls up his sleeve , looks at his scar again and shakes his head . While he is still puzzling over it , BELINDA comes back .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Such a to-do in the kitchen ! The cook 's given notice — at least she will directly — and your lamb cutlet slipped back to the shop when nobody was looking , and I 've got to go into the village again , and oh dear , oh dear , I have such a lot of things to do !<stage>Looking across at MR. BAXTER 'S door .</stage>Oh yes , that 's another one . Mr. Robinson , you will have to leave me . Farewell .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>Belinda —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>No , not even Belinda . Wait till this evening .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>I have a thousand things to say to you ; I shall say them this evening .</p>

      </sp>
      <stage>He takes her hand , looks at her for a moment , then suddenly bends and kisses it , and out .</stage>
      <stage>BELINDA stands looking from her hand to him , gives a little wondering exclamation and then presses the back of her hand against her cheek , and goes to the swing doors . She turns back , and remembers MR. BAXTER again . With a smile she goes to the door and taps gently .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Mr. Baxter , Mr. Baxter , you may come in now ; he has withdrawn . I have unhanded him .<stage>She opens the door and finds the room empty .</stage>Oh !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>BAXTER comes in at the front door .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Ah , there you are !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>turning with a start</stage>Oh , how you frightened me , Mr. Baxter ! I could n't think what had happened to you . I thought perhaps you 'd been eaten up by one of the umbrellas .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Mrs. Tremayne , I have some wonderful news for you . I have found</l>
        <l>Miss Robinson 's father .</l>

       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Yes . Mr. Robinson .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , you mean — Oh yes , he told me his name was Robinson — Oh , but he 's no relation .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Wait ! I saw his arm . By a subterfuge I managed to see his arm .</p>

      </sp>
      <stage>BELINDA holds the place with her other hand , and still looking at MR. BAXTER , slowly begins to laugh — half-laughter , half-tears , wonderingly , happily , contentedly .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>And I did n't know !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Mrs. Tremayne , I am delighted to have done this service for your niece —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>to herself</stage>Of course , he knew all the time .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>to the world</stage>Still more am I delighted to have gained the victory over Mr. Devenish in this enterprise .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Eighteen years — but I ought to have known .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>at large</stage>I shall not be accused of exaggerating when I say that the odds against such an enterprise were enormous .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Eighteen years — And now I 've eight whole hours to wait !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>triumphantly</stage>It will be announced to-night . “ Mr. Devenish , ” I shall say , “ young fellow — ”<stage>He arranges his speech in his mind .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>So I was right , after all !<stage>Slowly and triumphantly .</stage>He does look better without a beard !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>making his speech</stage>“ Mr. Devenish , young fellow , when you matched yourself against a man of my repute , when you matched yourself against a man ” —<stage>BELINDA has slipped out , to enjoy her happiness alone</stage>— “ who has read papers at soirées of the Royal Statistical Society ; when — er — ”</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>He looks round the room and discovers to his amazement that he is alone . He claps on his bowler-hat , gives another amazed look round , says with a shrug , “ Unusual ! ” and goes out .</stage>

      <stage>It is after dinner in BELINDA 'S hall . BELINDA is lying on the sofa with a coffee-cup in her hand . DELIA , in the chair on the right , has picked up “ The Lute of Love ” from a table and is reading it impatiently .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>What rubbish he writes !</p>

       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>coming back from her thoughts</stage>Who , dear ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Claude — Mr. Devenish . Of course , he 's very young .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>So was Keats , darling .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>I do n't think Claude has had Keats ’ advantages . Keats started life as an apothecary .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>So much nicer than a chemist .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Now , Claude started with nothing to do .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>mildly</stage>Do you always call him Claude , darling ? I hope you are n't going to grow into a flirt like that horrid Mrs. Tremayne .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Silly mother !<stage>Seriously</stage>I do n't think he 'll ever be any good till he really gets work . Did you notice his hair this evening ?</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Mummy , look me in the eye and tell me you are not being bad .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>innocently</stage>Bad , darling ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>You 've made Mr. Robinson fall in love with you .</p>

       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>happily</stage>Have I ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Yes ; it 's serious this time . He 's not like the other two .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>However did you know that ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , I know .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Darling , I believe you 've grown up . It 's quite time I settled down .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>With Mr. Robinson ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>BELINDA looks thoughtfully at DELIA for a little time and then sits up .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>mysteriously</stage>Delia , are you prepared for a great secret to be revealed to you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>childishly</stage>Oh , I love secrets .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>reproachfully</stage>Darling , you must n't take it like that . This is a great , deep , dark secret ; you 'll probably need your sal volatile .</p>

       <p>Go on , mummy .</p>

       <lg>
        <l>Well , Mr. Robinson is —</l>
        <stage>impressively</stage>
        <l>— is not quite the</l>
        <l>Robinson he appears to be .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Yes ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>In fact , child , he is — Had n't you better come and hold your mother 's hand ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>struggling with some emotion</stage>Go on .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Well , Mr. Robinson is a — sort of relation of yours ; in fact —<stage>playing with her rings and looking down coyly</stage>— he is your — father .<stage>She looks up at DELIA to see how the news is being received .</stage>Dear one , this is not a matter for mirth .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>coming over and kissing her</stage>Darling , it is lovely , is n't it ? I am laughing because I am so happy .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Are n't you surprised ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>No . You see , Claude told me this morning . He found out just before Mr. Baxter .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Well ! Every one seems to have known except me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Did n't you see how friendly father and I got at dinner ? I thought I 'd better start breaking the ice — because I suppose he 'll be kissing me directly .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Say you like him .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>I think he 's going to be awfully nice . Does he know you know ?<stage>She goes back to her seat .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Not yet . Just at present I 've rather got Mr. Baxter on my mind . I suppose , darling , you would n't like him as well as Mr. Devenish !<stage>Pathetically .</stage>You see , they 're so used to going about together .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Claude is quite enough .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>I think I must see Mr. Baxter and get it over . Do you mind if I have Mr. Devenish too ? I feel more at home with both of them . I 'll give you him back . Oh dear , I feel so happy to-night !<stage>She jumps up and goes over to DELIA .</stage>And is my little girl going to be happy too ? That 's what mothers always say on the stage . I think it 's so sweet .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>smiling at her</stage>Yes , I think so , mummy . Of course , I 'm not romantic like you . I expect I 'm more like father , really .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>dreamily</stage>Jack can be romantic now . He was telling me this morning all about the people he has proposed to . I mean , I was telling him . Anyhow , he was n't a bit like a father . Of course , he does n't know he is a father yet . Darling , I think you might take him into the garden ; only do n't let him know who he is . You see , he ought to propose to me first , ought n't he ?<stage>As the men come in , she gets up .</stage>Here you all are ! I do hope you have n't been throwing away your cigars , because smoking is allowed all over the house .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , we 've finished , thank you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Is n't it a wonderful night ?— and so warm for April . Delia , you must show Mr. Robinson the garden by moonlight — it 's the only light he has n't seen it by .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>quickly</stage>I do n't think I 've ever seen it by moonlight , Miss Delia .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>I thought poets were always seeing things by moonlight .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>I was hoping , Mrs. Tremayne , that — er — perhaps —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Come along , Mr. Robinson .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>TREMAYNE looks at BELINDA , who gives him a nod .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>It 's very kind of you , Miss Robinson . I suppose there is no chance of a nightingale ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>There ought to be . I ordered one specially for Mr. Devenish .<stage>DELIA and TREMAYNE go out together . BELINDA settles herself comfortably on the sofa .</stage>Now we 're together again . Well , Mr. Devenish ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Er — I —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>No ; I think I 'll let Mr. Baxter speak first . I know he 's longing to .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Yes . H'r ' m ! Mrs. Tremayne , I beg formally to claim your hand .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>sweetly</stage>On what grounds , Mr. Baxter ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>spiritedly</stage>Yes , sir , on what grounds ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>On the grounds that , as I told you this morning , I had succeeded in the quest .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>appearing to be greatly surprised</stage>Succeeded ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Yes , Mr. Devenish , young fellow , you have lost . I have discovered the missing Mr. Robinson .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Who — where —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>dramatically</stage>Miss Robinson has at this moment gone out with her father .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Good heavens ! It was he !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>sympathetically</stage>Poor Mr. Devenish !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>pointing tragically to the table</stage>And to think that I actually sat on that table — no , that seat — no , not that one , it was the sofa — that I sat on the sofa with him this morning , and never guessed ! Why , ten minutes ago I was asking him for the nuts !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Aha , Devenish , you 're not so clever as you thought you were .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Why , I must have given you the clue myself ! He told me he had a scar on his arm , and I never thought any more of it . And then I went away innocently and left you two talking about it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>alarmed</stage>A scar on his arm ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Where a lion mauled him .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>BELINDA gives a little shudder .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>It 's quite healed up now , Mrs. Tremayne .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking at him admiringly</stage>A lion ! What you two have adventured for my sake !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>I suppose you will admit , Devenish , that I may fairly claim to have won ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>Looking the picture of despair , DEVENISH droops his head , raises his arms and lets them fall hopelessly to his sides .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Mr. Devenish , I have never admired you so much as I do at this moment .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>indignantly to DEVENISH</stage>I say , you know , that 's not fair . It 's all very well to take your defeat like a man , but you must n't overdo it . Mrs. Tremayne , I claim the reward which I have earned .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>after a pause</stage>Mr. Baxter — Mr. Devenish , I have something to tell you .<stage>Penitently .</stage>I have not been quite frank with you . I think you both ought to know that — I — I made a mistake . Delia is not my niece ; she is my daughter .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Your daughter ! I say , how ripping !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>BELINDA gives him an understanding look .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Your daughter !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>But — but you are n't old enough to have a daughter of that age .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>apologetically</stage>Well , there she is .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>But — but she 's grown up .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Quite .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Then in that case you must be —<stage>He hesitates , evidently working it out .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>hastily</stage>I 'm afraid so , Mr. Baxter .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>But this makes a great difference . I had no idea . Why , when I 'm fifty you would be —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>sighing</stage>Yes , I suppose I should .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>And when I 'm sixty —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>pleadingly to DEVENISH</stage>Ca n't you stop him ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Look here , Baxter , another word from you and you 'll never get to sixty .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>And then there 's Miss — er — Delia . In the event of our marrying ,</l>
        <l>Mrs. Tremayne , she , I take it , would be my step-daughter .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>I do n't think she would trouble us much , Mr. Baxter . I have an idea that she will be getting married before long .<stage>She glances at DEVENISH , who returns her look gratefully .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>None the less , the fact would be disturbing . I have never yet considered myself seriously as a step-father . I do n't think I am going too far if I say that to some extent I have been deceived in this matter .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>reproachfully</stage>And so have I. I thought you loved me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>sympathetically</stage>Yes , yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>turning to him suddenly</stage>And Mr. Devenish too .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>

       <p>Er —</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>They stand before her guiltily and have nothing to say .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>with a shrug</stage>Well , I shall have to marry somebody else , that 's all .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Who ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>I suppose Mr. Robinson . After all , if I am Delia 's mother , and Mr. Baxter says that Mr. Robinson 's her father , it 's about time we were married .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>eagerly</stage>Mrs. Tremayne , what fools we are ! He is your husband all the time !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>You 've had a husband all the time ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>apologetically</stage>I lost him ; it was n't my fault .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Really , this is very confusing . I do n't know where I am . I gather — I am to gather , it seems , that you are no longer eligible as a possible wife ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>I am afraid not , Mr. Baxter .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>But this is very confusing — this is very disturbing to a man of my age . For weeks past I have been regarding myself as a — a possible benedict . I have — ah — taken steps . Only this morning , in writing to my housekeeper , I warned her that she might hear at any moment a most startling announcement .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>cheerfully</stage>Oh , that 's all right . That might only mean that you were getting a new bowler-hat .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>suddenly</stage>Ah , and what about you , sir ? How is it that you take this so lightly ?<stage>Triumphantly .</stage>I have it . It all becomes clear to me . You have transferred your affections to her daughter !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Oh , I say , Baxter , this is very crude .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>And why should he not , Mr. Baxter ?<stage>Softly .</stage>He has made me very happy .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>He has made you happy , Mrs. Tremayne !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Very happy .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>thoughtfully</stage>Ah !<stage>He takes a turn round the room in , silence , and then comes back to her .</stage>Mrs. Tremayne , I have taken a great resolve .<stage>Solemnly .</stage>I also will make you happy .<stage>Thumping his heart .</stage>I also will woo Miss Delia .<stage>Suddenly seizing DEVENISH 'S arm</stage>Come , we will seek Miss Delia together . It may be that she will send us upon another quest in which I shall again be victorious .<stage>Tempestuously</stage>Come , I say !<stage>He marches the resisting DEVENISH to the swing doors .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>to BELINDA</stage>Please !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>gently</stage>Mr. Baxter ... Harold .<stage>BAXTER stops and turns round .</stage>You are too impetuous . I think that as Delia 's mother —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Your pardon , Mrs. Tremayne . In the intoxication of the moment I am forgetting .<stage>Formally .</stage>I have the honour to ask your permission to pay my addresses —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>No , no , I did n't mean that . But , as Delia 's mother , I ought to warn you that she is hardly fitted to take the place of your housekeeper . She is not very domesticated .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>indignantly</stage>Not domesticated ? Why , did I not hear her tell her father at dinner that she had arranged all the flowers ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>There are other things than flowers .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Bed-socks , for instance , Baxter . It 's a very tricky thing airing bed-socks . I am sure your house-keeper —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Mrs. Tremayne , she will learn . The daughter of such a mother ... I need say no more .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , thank you . But there is something else , Mr. Baxter . You are not being quite fair to yourself . In starting out upon this simultaneous wooing , you forget that Mr. Devenish has already had his turn this morning alone . You should have yours ... alone ... too .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Oh , I say !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Yes , yes , you are right . I must introduce myself first as a suitor . I see that .<stage>To DEVENISH</stage>You stay here ; I will go alone into the garden , and —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>It is perhaps a little cold out of doors for people of ... of our age , Mr. Baxter . Now , in the library —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>astonished</stage>Library ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>You have a library ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>to DEVENISH</stage>He does n't believe I have a library .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>You ought to see the library , Baxter .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>But you are continually springing surprises on me this evening , Mrs. Tremayne . First a daughter , then a husband , and then — a library ! I have been here three weeks , and I never knew you had a library . Dear me , I wonder how it is that I never saw it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>modestly</stage>I thought you came to see me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>Yes , yes , to see you , certainly . But if I had known you had a library ....</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , I am so glad I mentioned it . Was n't it lucky , Mr. Devenish ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BAXTER</speaker>
       <p>My work has been greatly handicapped of late by lack of certain books to which I wanted to refer . It would be a great help —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>My dear Mr. Baxter , my whole library is at your disposal .<stage>To DEVENISH , as she leads the way to the door , in a confidential whisper .</stage>I 'm just going to show him the “ Encyclopedia Britannica . ”<stage>She smiles at him , and he opens the door for them both . Then he goes towards the garden door and looks outside .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>from the garden</stage>Hullo , we 're just coming in .<stage>He goes back and waits for them .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>Where 's Mrs. Tremayne ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>She 's gone to the library with Baxter .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>carelessly</stage>Oh , the library . Where 's that ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>promptly going towards the door and opening it</stage>The end door on the right . Right at the end . You can n't mistake it . On the right .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Ah , yes .</l>
        <stage>He looks round at DELIA .</stage>
        <l>Yes .</l>
        <stage>He looks at DEVENISH .</stage>
        <l>Yes .</l>
        <stage>He goes out .</stage>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <stage>DEVENISH hastily shuts the door and comes back to DELIA .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>I say , your mother is a ripper .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>enthusiastically</stage>Is n't she !<stage>Remembering .</stage>At least , you mean my aunt ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>smiling at her</stage>No , I mean your mother . To think that I once had the cheek to propose to her .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Oh ! Is it cheek to propose to people !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>To her .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>But not to me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Oh I say , Delia !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>with great dignity</stage>Thank you , my name is Miss Robinson — I mean , Tremayne .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Well , if you 're not quite sure which it is , it 's much safer to call you Delia .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>smiling</stage>Well , perhaps it is .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>And if I did propose to you , you have n't answered</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>If you want an answer now , it 's no ; but if you like to wait till next April —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>reproachfully</stage>Oh , I say , and I cut my hair for you the same afternoon . You have n't really told me how you like it yet .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , how bad of me ! You look lovely .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>And I promised to give up poetry for your sake .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Perhaps I ought n't to have asked you that .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>As far as I 'm concerned , Delia , I 'll do it gladly , but , of course , one has to think about posterity .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>But you need n't be a poet . You could give posterity plenty to think about if you were a statesman .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>I do n't quite see your objection to poetry .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>You would be about the house so much . I want you to go away every day and do great things , and then come home in the evening and tell me all about it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Then you are thinking of marrying me !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>Well , I was just thinking in case I had to .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>It would be rather fun if you did . And look here — I will be a statesman , if you like , and go up to Downing Street every day , and come back in the evening and tell you all about it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>How nice of you !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>magnificently , holding up his hand to Heaven</stage>Farewell , Parnassus !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>What does that mean ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Well , it means that I 've chucked poetry . A statesman 's life is the life for me ; behold Mr. Devenish , the new M. P .— no , look here , that was quite accidental .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>smiling at him</stage>I believe I shall really like you when I get to know you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>I do n't know if it 's you , or Devonshire , or the fact that I 've had my hair cut , but I feel quite a different being from what I was three days ago .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>You are different . Perhaps it 's your sense of humour coming back .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>Perhaps that 's it . It 's a curious feeling .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>holding out her hand</stage>Let 's go outside ; there 's a heavenly moon .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p><stage>taking her hand</stage>Moon ? Moon ? Now where have I heard that word before ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DELIA</speaker>
       <p>What do you mean ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DEVENISH</speaker>
       <p>I was trying not to be a poet . Well , I 'll come with you , but I shall refuse to look at it .<stage>Putting his left hand behind his back , he walks slowly out with her , saying to himself</stage>The Prime Minister then left the House .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>BELINDA and TREMAYNE come from the library .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>as he opens the door</stage>Thank you . I do n't think it 's unkind to leave him , do you ? He seemed quite happy .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>I should n't have been happy if we 'd stayed .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>going to the sofa and putting her feet up</stage>Yes , but I was really thinking of Mr. Baxter .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>Not of me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Well , I thought it was Mr. Baxter 's turn . Poor man , he 's had a disappointment lately .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>eagerly</stage>A disappointment ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Yes , he thought I was — younger than I was .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>smiling to himself</stage>How old are you , Belinda ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>dropping her eyes</stage>Twenty-two .<stage>After a pause .</stage>He thought I was eighteen . Such a disappointment !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>smiling openly at her</stage>Belinda , how old are you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Just about the right age , Mr. Robinson .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>The right age for what ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>For this sort of conversation .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>Shall I tell you how old you are ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Do you mean in figures or — poetically ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>I meant —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Mr. Devenish said I was as old as the — now , I must get this the right way round — as old as the —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>I do n't want to talk about Mr. Devenish .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>with a sigh</stage>Nobody ever does — except Mr. Devenish . As old as the stars , and as young as the dawn .<stage>Settling herself cosily .</stage>I think that 's rather a nice age to be , do n't you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>A very nice age to be .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>It 's a pity he 's thrown me over for Delia ; I shall miss that sort of thing rather . You do n't say those sort of things about your aunt-in-law — not so often .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>eagerly</stage>He really is in love with Miss Robinson !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Oh yes . I expect he is out in the moonlight with her now , comparing her to Diana .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>Well , that accounts for him . Now what about Baxter ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>I thought I told you . Deeply disappointed to find that I was four years older than he expected , Mr. Baxter hurried from the drawing-room and buried himself in a column of the “ Encyclopedia Britannica . ”</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>Well , that settles Baxter . Are there any more men in the neighbourhood ?</p>

       <p>My name is John .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Well , you never told me . I had to guess . Everybody thinks they can call me Belinda without giving me the least idea what their own names are . You were saying , John ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>My friends call me Jack .</p>

       <p>Jack Robinson . That 's the man who always goes away so quickly . I hope you 're making more of a stay ?</p>

       <p>Oh , you maddening , maddening woman !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Well , I have to keep the conversation going . You do nothing but say “ Belinda . ”</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>I do n't ever do anything very seriously . The late Mr. Tremayne , my first husband — Jack — Is n't it funny , his name was Jack — he used to complain about it too sometimes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>with conviction</stage>Silly ass !</p>

       <p>You quarrelled ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Yes . It was his fault entirely .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>I 'm sure it was .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>He wo n't — I know he wo n't . Do n't you love me enough to risk it , Belinda ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>I have n't really said I love you at all yet .</p>

       <p><stage>mildly</stage>Well , darling , you knew all the time that I was your wife , and you 've been making love to me and leading me on .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>That 's different .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>That 's just what the late Mr. Tremayne said , and then he slammed the door and went straight off to the Rocky Mountains and shot bears ; and I did n't see him again for eighteen years .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>remorsefully</stage>Darling , I was a fool then , and I 'm a fool now .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>I was a fool then , but I 'm not such a fool now — I 'm not going to let you go . It 's quite time I married and settled down .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>You darling ! How did you find out who I was ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>awkwardly</stage>Well , it was rather curious , darling .<stage>After a pause .</stage>It was April , and I felt all sort of Aprily , and — and — there was the garden all full of daffodils — and — and there was Mr. Baxter — the one we left in the library — knowing all about moles . He 's probably got the M volume down now . Well , we were talking about them one day , and I happened to say that the late Mr. Tremayne — that was you , darling — had rather a peculiar one on his arm . And then he happened to see it this morning and told me about it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>What an extraordinary story !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Yes , darling ; it 's really much more extraordinary than that . I think perhaps I 'd better tell you the rest of it another time .<stage>Coaxingly .</stage>Now show me where the nasty lion scratched you .<stage>TREMAYNE pulls up his sleeve .</stage>Oh !<stage>She kisses his arm .</stage>You should n't have left Chelsea , darling .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>I should never have found you if I had n't .</p>
      </sp>

       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p><stage>squeezing his arm</stage>No , Jack , you would n't .<stage>After a pause .</stage>I — I 've got another little surprise for you if — if you 're ready for it .<stage>Standing up</stage>Properly speaking , I ought to be wearing white . I shall certainly stand up while I 'm telling you .<stage>Modestly .</stage>Darling , we have a daughter — our little Delia .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>Delia ? You said her name was Robinson .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>Yes , darling , but you said yours was . One always takes one 's father 's name . Unless , of course , you were Lord Robinson .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>But you said her name was Robinson before you — oh , never mind about that . A daughter ? Belinda , how could you let me go and not tell me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>You forget how you 'd slammed the door . It is n't the sort of thing you shout through the window to a man on his way to America .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p><stage>taking her in his arms</stage>Oh , Belinda , do n't let me ever go away again .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BELINDA</speaker>
       <p>I 'm not going to , Jack . I 'm going to settle down into a staid old married woman .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>TREMAYNE</speaker>
       <p>Oh no , you 're not . You 're going on just as you did before . And I 'm going to propose to you every April , and win you , over all the other men in love with you .</p>

     <stage>THE RED FEATHERS</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>AN OPERETTA IN ONE ACT</speaker>
      <p><stage>In the living-room of a country-house , half farm , half manor , a MOTHER and her DAUGHTER are sitting . It is any year you please — between , let us say , the day when the fiddle first came to England and the day when Romance left it . As for the time of the year , let us call it May . Oh yes , it is certainly May , and about twelve o'clock , and the DAUGHTER is singing at the spinet , while her MOTHER is at her needlework . Through the lattice windows the murmur of a stream can be heard , on whose banks — but we shall come to that directly . Let us listen now to what the DAUGHTER is singing :</stage>Life passes by . I do not know its pleasure or its pain — The Spring was here , the Spring is here again , The Spring will die . Life passes by . The doors of Pain and Pleasure open wide , The crowd streams in — and I am left outside .... They know ; not I .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>You do n't like it ? Neither did her Mother .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p><stage>looking up from her work</stage>Yes , I should call that a melancholy song , dear .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DAUGHTER</speaker>
      <p>It is sung by a melancholy person , Mother .</p>

      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>Why are you that , child ?</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>Well , so do we all .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DAUGHTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>impatiently</stage>Oh , why does nothing ever happen ? We sit here all day , and we sing or do our embroidery , and we go to bed , and the next day we get up and do the same things over again , and so it goes on . Mother , is that all there is in the world ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>It 's all there is in our world .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DAUGHTER</speaker>
      <p>Are we so very poor ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>We have the house — and very little else .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DAUGHTER</speaker>
      <p>Oh , I wish that we were really poor —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>You need n't wish , child .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DAUGHTER</speaker>
      <p>Oh , but I mean so that it would n't matter what clothes we wore ; so that we could wander over the hills and down into the valleys , and sleep perhaps in a barn and bathe ourselves in the brook next morning , and —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>I do n't think I should like that very much . Perhaps I 'm peculiar .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DAUGHTER</speaker>
      <p>Oh , if only I were a boy to go out and make my own way in the world . Would you let me go , Mother , if I were a boy ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>I do n't suppose you 'd ask me , dear .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DAUGHTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>sighing</stage>Oh , well ! We must make the best of it , I suppose . Perhaps one day something will happen .<stage>She goes back to the spinet and sings again .</stage>Lads and lasses , what will you sell , What will you sell ? Four stout walls and a roof atop , Warm fires gleaming brightly , Well-stored cellar and garnered crop , Money-bags packed tightly ; An ordered task in an ordered day , And a sure bed nightly ; Years which peacefully pass away , Until Death comes lightly . Lads and lasses , what will you buy ? What will you buy ? Here is a cap to cover your head , A cap with one red feather ; Here is a cloak to make your bed Warm or winter weather ; Here is a satchel to store your ware , Strongly lined with leather ; And here is a staff to take you there When you go forth together . Lads and lasses , what will you gain , What will you gain ? Chatter of rooks on tall elm-trees New Spring houses taking ; Daffodils in an April breeze Golden curtsies making ; Shadows of clouds across the weald From hill to valley breaking , The first faint stir which the woodlands yield When the world is waking . Lads and lasses , this is your gain , This is your gain .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Towards the end of the song the face and shoulders of the TALKER appear at the open lattice window on the left . He listens with a bland and happy smile until the song is finished .</stage>

      <p>Intrusion ? Oh , fie ! Madame , not intrusion . My feet stand upon the highway . The road , Madame , is common to all . I can quote you Rex — What does Rex , cap . 27 , para . 198 , say ? Via , says Rex , meaning the road ; communis is common ; omnibus to all , meaning thereby — but perchance I weary you ?</p>

      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>Ah , Mademoiselle Nightingale , you may indeed ask . Who is he ? Is he the Pope of Rome ? Nay , he is not the Pope of Rome . Is he the Cham of Tartary ? Nay , he is not the Cham of Tartary , for an he were the Cham of Tartary —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>I beg you , sir , to tell us as shortly as you can who you are and what you want .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>Madam , by nature I am a taciturn man ; Silent John I am named by my friends . I am a glum body , a reserved creature . These things you will have already noticed . But now I will commit to you it secret , known only to my dearest friends . Uncommunicative as I am by nature<stage>he disappears and reappears at the middle window</stage>, I am still more so when compelled to hold converse with two such ornaments of their sex<stage>he disappears and reappears at the right-hand window</stage>through a lattice window . Am I getting any nearer the door ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p><stage>resigned</stage>Pray , sir , come in and tell us all about it . I see that we must have your tale .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>To be exact , Madame , I have two tails who follow me about everywhere . One is of my own poor sex , a man , a thing of whiskers ; the other has the honour to belong to that sex which — have I said it ?— you and Mademoiselle so adorn . Have I your ladyship 's permission ?</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a bow</stage>Madame , I shall never forget this . Though I live to be ninety-three , this will always be engraved upon my memory . My grandchildren climbing upon my knee will wonder sometimes of what the old man is thinking . Little will they know — But I will attend you further within .<stage>He bows and disappears .</stage></p>

      <speaker>DAUGHTER</speaker>
      <p>Mother , something is going to happen at last .</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>Oh , child , were you as weary as that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>The TALKER comes in at the door , followed by the SINGER and the FIDDLER . The SINGER is a pleasant-looking man of middle height , the FIDDLER a tall , silent girl . The TALKER himself is short and round , with a twinkling eye . Each wears a cap with a red feather in it .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>Madame , your humble and most devoted servants . I have the honour to present to you her Royal Sweetness the Princess Carissima , His Flutiness the Duke of Bogota , and myself a mere Marquis .</p>

      <p>Oh , Mother , they 're wandering minstrels .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>I bid you all welcome , sir .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>Permit me to expound further . The Princess — a courtesy title bestowed by myself last Michaelmas Day — plays upon the fiddle with an unerring beauty which makes strong men weep . You shall hear her . I pray you have your handkerchers ready . His Flutiness the Duke — the title was granted last Candlemas — has a voice of a rare richness . He is cursed with a melancholy disposition most pleasing . He suffers from a surfeit of rejected love . A most waggish companion withal .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DAUGHTER</speaker>
      <p>Oh , what a shame !</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>SINGER</speaker>
      <p>You must not believe all that Johannes says , ladies .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>I had already learnt that much , sir .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>For myself , I play upon the pipe . You shall hear .<stage>He plays “ cuckoo ” with an air .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SINGER</speaker>
      <p>The only notes he knows , ladies .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p><stage>indignantly</stage>Oh , fie , Sir , fie ! I protest , Madame , he maligns me . Have I not a G of surpassing splendour , of a fruitiness rarely encountered in this vale of tears ? Madame , you must hear my G. Now , where is it ?<stage>He arranges his fingers with great care on the pipe .</stage>I have it .<stage>He blows a G , and bows deeply first to MOTHER and then to DAUGHTER .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SINGER</speaker>
      <p>Marvellous !</p>

      <p><stage>to TALKER</stage>I thank you , Sir .</p>

      <speaker>DAUGHTER</speaker>
      <p>Oh , Mother , is n't he splendid ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p><stage>to MOTHER</stage>Would you like my G again , Madame ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>Not just now , I thank you , sir . Doubtless we shall feel more in need of it a little later on . But tell me , Sir , have you no other talent to match the singing and playing of your friends ?</p>

      <speaker>FIDDLER</speaker>
      <p>He talks .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>I had noticed it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>This gift of talking with which her Royal Sweetness is good enough to credit me , irksome though it is to a man of silent habit like myself , a creature , as you will have noticed , of taciturn disposition ; this — I —<stage>Frankly</stage>Madame , I have lost that sentence . Have I your gracious permission to begin again ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>I think it would be better , Sir .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>Then , to put it shortly , Madame —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>If you could , sir .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>To be completely frank in this matter , Madame , I — er — go round with the hat . It is a sordid but necessary business .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DAUGHTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>eagerly</stage>Oh , I hope they give you plenty of money .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>Enough to support life , Mademoiselle . The hungry look which you observe upon His Flutiness is , as I have explained , due to melancholy .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DAUGHTER</speaker>
      <p>You are going to perform , are n't you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>Of a surety , Mademoiselle . Perhaps I should add that for myself I am resting just now , and that my part of the performance will be limited to nothing more than a note or two upon the pipe .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a friendly smile</stage>Sir , you are generous . We shall be glad to hear your friends .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>The TALKER bows and turns to his company .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>A song , good Master Duke , a song which her Royal Sweetness will accompany upon the fiddle . Let it end , I pray you , with a G , so that I may bring the thing to a climax upon the last note .</p>

       <l>You like that ?</l>
       <stage>She nods .</stage>
       <l>Very well .</l>
       <stage>He sings .</stage>
       <l>Oh , when the wind is in the North ,</l>
       <l>I take my staff and sally forth ;</l>
       <l>And when it whistles from the East</l>
       <l>I do not mind it in the least ;</l>
       <l>The warm wind murmurs through the trees</l>
       <l>Its messages from Southern seas ;</l>
       <l>But after all perhaps the best</l>
       <l>Is that which whispers from the West .</l>
       <l>Oh let the wind , the wind be what it will ,</l>
       <l>So long as I may walk on Morland Hill !</l>
       <l>The staff which helps to carry me ,</l>
       <l>I cut it from the Hazel-tree ;</l>
       <l>But once I had a cudgel torn</l>
       <l>Most circumspectly from the Thorn ;</l>
       <l>I know a fellow , far from rash ,</l>
       <l>Who swears entirely by the Ash ;</l>
       <l>And all good travellers invoke</l>
       <l>A blessing on the mighty Oak .</l>
       <l>Oh let the wood , the wood be what it will ,</l>
       <l>So long as I may walk on Morland Hill !</l>
       <l>Some years ago I gave my heart</l>
       <l>To Prue until we had to part ;</l>
       <l>Then , seeing Susan 's pretty face ,</l>
       <l>I left it with her for a space ;</l>
       <l>And Susan had my heart until</l>
       <l>I wanted it for Mistress Jill ;</l>
       <l>I think , although I am not clear ,</l>
       <l>That Chloe 's had it this last year .</l>
       <l>Oh let the wench , the wench be whom you will ,</l>
       <l>So long as I may walk on Morland Hill !</l>

     <stage>The TALKER comes in proudly on the last note and takes most of the applause .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DAUGHTER</speaker>
      <p>I 'm not sure that I like that last verse .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>Oh , you must n't believe all he sings . A cursed melancholy fellow by nature . But waggish — waggish withal .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SINGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>to DAUGHTER</stage>We have to sing what the poets write for us , Mademoiselle . Had I written a song myself , it had been about one woman only .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>And there would have been a hundred and twenty-five verses to it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>Your song was well sung , sir ; I thank you for it .</l>

      <p><stage>eagerly</stage>Yes , of course , I will if I can .<stage>She goes to the spinet .</stage></p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DAUGHTER</speaker>
      <p>Yes , I think so .<stage>She plays . At the end of it the TALKER finds himself bowing to the applause .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>And now , Madame , you have had a sample of all our poor talents , save and except that paltry talent of mine which in other company concludes such a performance . I pray you tell me what you think of the entertainment .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>I have enjoyed it immensely , good Master Johannes . And if you did wish to exercise that talent of yours , of which so far we have only heard —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>Nay , nay , Madame , I beg you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>Yes ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>, The fact is , Madame , that now we approach or , so to speak , draw nigh or adjacent — in other words , Madame , we are perilously approximate —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FIDDLER</speaker>
      <p>Tell her straight out .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>Tell her what ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FIDDLER</speaker>
      <p>What we 've come for .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SINGER</speaker>
      <p>Master Johannes , Madam , is so accustomed when he goes round with the hat to disguise under it flow of words the fact that money is as necessary to an artist as applause , that he has lost the habit of saying anything in less than ten sentences .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p><stage>mournfully</stage>And yet I am a taciturn man .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>MOWER</speaker>
      <p>Well , will somebody tell me , for I confess I have been wondering what is behind it all .</p>

      <speaker>FIDDLER</speaker>
      <p>Tell her , Johannes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>If you will allow me , Madame . But tell me first , did you notice anything lacking in our performance ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p><stage>surprised</stage>No ; I do n't think so .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p><stage>to DAUGHTER</stage>Perhaps you , Mademoiselle ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DAUGHTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>shyly</stage>It seemed to lack a woman 's voice , sir .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p><stage>admiringly</stage>What intelligence ! What profundity !<stage>To MOTHER</stage>Madam , I felicitate you again on your daughter . Unerringly she has laid her finger on the weak joint in our armour . We have no woman 's voice .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>Well , Sir , I do n't see how I can help you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>Madame , you have a nightingale . It has lived in a cage all its life . It looks through the bars sometimes , and sees the great world outside , and sighs and turns back to its business of singing . Madame , it would sing better outside in the open air , with the other birds .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>I do n't understand you , sir . Are you referring to my daughter ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p><stage>looking towards the window</stage>There is a stream which runs beyond the road , with a green bank to it . We were seated on that bank , I and my two companions , eating our bread and cheese , and washing it down with draughts from that good stream . We were tired , for we had come from over the hills that morning , and it was good to lie on our backs there and watch the little clouds taking shape after shape in the blue , and so to dream our dreams . In a little while the road would take us westward , here through a wood banked with primroses , there across a common or between high spring hedges with the little stream babbling ever at the side of us . And in the evening we would come to an inn , where there would be good company , and we would sing and play to them , and they would reward us .<stage>With a shrug</stage>It is a pleasant life .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DAUGHTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>eagerly</stage>Oh , go on !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>Yes , go on , Sir .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>We were lying on our backs thus , Madame , when we heard the nightingale . “ Duke , ” says I , “ it is early yet for the nightingale . ” His Flutiness removes his cap from his face , takes a squint at the sun , and says “ Monstrous early , good Master Johannes , ” and claps his cap back again . “ What says you , Fiddler , ” says I , “ in this matter of nightingales ? Is it possible , ” says I ; “ the sun being where it is , and nightingales being what they are — to wit , nightingales ? ” “ It 's not a nightingale , ” says Fiddler dreamily , “ it 's a girl . ” “ Then , ” says I , jumping up , “ it is a girl we want . She must put the red feather in her cap , and come her ways with us . ”<stage>With a bow</stage>Madame , your humble servant .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DAUGHTER</speaker>
      <p>Oh , Mother , you will let me go , wo n't you ? I must , I must ! He is quite right . I 'm caged here . Oh , you will let me see something of the world before I grow old !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FIDDLER</speaker>
      <p><stage>suddenly</stage>Yes , let her come . If she feels like that , she ought to come .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SINGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a very winning smile</stage>We will take great care of her , Madame , as if she were our own sister .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p><stage>surprisingly to JOHANNES</stage>What do you think of cider as a drink , Master Johannes ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p><stage>who had not expected it , but is always ready</stage>Cider — ah , there 's a drink ! Oh , I can talk to you about cider , glum body as I am by nature , having been as it were taciturn from birth . Yet of cider I could talk you —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>Ours is considered very good cider .<stage>To her daughter</stage>Take them , child , and give them such refreshment as they want . They have deserved it for their entertainment .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DAUGHTER</speaker>
      <p>Why , of course , Mother . Come this way please .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>She leads the way , and the others follow , the TALKER coming last and murmuring “ Cider ” to himself .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>Master Johannes .<stage>He turns round .</stage>A word with you , if you please , sir .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>But certainly , Madame . The cider will be all the better for the expectation .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>Sit down , please .<stage>He does so .</stage>Master Johannes , who are you , all of you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>I thought I had explained , Madame . Her Royal Sweetness Princess Carissima , His Flutiness the Duke of Bogota , and myself a humble Marquis . We may be referred to collectively as the Red Feathers . For myself I am sometimes called Silent John , being of a close disposition .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>Whatever you are called , you are , I think , a man of the world , and you will understand that if I am to trust my daughter to you , for however little a time , I must know something more about you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>Madame , I will make a confession to you , a confession I have never yet made to man , woman , or child . I am forty-six years of age ; it is , in fact , my birthday . Were I to begin to tell you something about myself , starting from that day , forty-six years ago , when I was born — were I to begin — well , Madame , I am only too ready to begin . It is a subject I find vastly pleasant . But ,<stage>looking at her comically</stage>shall I begin ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a smile</stage>Would you make it so long a story , sir ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a sigh</stage>The tongue is an unruly member , and to one who has but three notes on the pipe , and yet desires to express himself , talking is a great comfort .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>I said you were a man of the world , sir . May I say now that I think you must be a man of our world ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>I am a man of many worlds . But if it would comfort your mother 's heart to know that your daughter will be in good company , I think I can give you that comfort .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>Is that all you can give me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>The TALKER gets up and walks about , frowning to himself . Suddenly he takes out his pipe , plays “ cuckoo ” to himself very solemnly , and is immensely relieved thereby . He comes back to the MOTHER with a beaming face .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>Madame , I will tell you a story .<stage>Holding up his hand to stop any expostulation</stage>No , quite a short one . Once on a time there was a certain noble gentleman , a baron of estates and family . Conceiving himself to be in love , he dared to put it to the touch to win or lose it all . I regret to say that he lost it all . In a fit of melancholy he abjured society , cursed all women and took to the road . A pleasant melancholy gentleman . I made him a duke .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p><stage>eagerly , indicating the door out of which the duke has just gone</stage>You mean he really is —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>We will name no names , madame . I doubt not I have no right to speak of him to another . It is just a story .<stage>Putting his pipe to his lips</stage>Cuck-oo !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>Poor child , she is not happy here . We live so quietly ; we have no neighbours . I have wondered what to do — it seemed that I could do so little . If only I could be sure —<stage>Suddenly</stage>Master Johannes , do you like the look of this house with its little stream opposite , and the green bank running down , on which one may lie on one 's back and look up at the sky ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>Did we not single it out above all others by having our bread and cheese outside it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>Will you all stay with me for a little ? I think I can find room for you . Before I can lend my daughter to you , I feel that I must know something of you . I think that is the best way , is it not ?<stage>With a very friendly smile</stage>The cider is good , you know .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p><stage>rising and boning</stage>Madame , we need say no more .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>The other three come in . The DAUGHTER has found from somewhere a cap with a red feather in it . They stand in a row opposite the MOTHER , and to the FIDDLER 'S accompaniment sing a merry song .</stage>

      <p>Eight days ! And Troy was besieged for eleven years ! Eight days ! Why , I could talk for eight days without taking breath , and I am by nature a glum , silent man . Nay , nay , say not to me “ Eight days . ” Eight days will not make a man grow old or a woman lose her beauty .<stage>The MOTHER comes into the room .</stage>Or a woman lose her beauty — Madame , I kiss your hands . Were I of less girth I would flit through the window and fall upon my knees at your feet .<stage>The FIDDLER with a shrug goes out .</stage>As it is , I shall enter by the door in the usual way . I have your permission ?</p>

      <p>Who say so ? Is not Master Johannes the master of his company ? Who say so ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>The birds . I held converse with a cuckoo-bird this morning . “ Cuckoo , ” he said — in this manner<stage>he imitates it on his pipe</stage>— meaning , as I gathered , “ O fool ! ” I bowed low to him , and “ Pardon , bird , ” said I ,— “ but I would have you tell me why I am a fool . ” He answered thus in parables — “ Cuckoo . ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>And what did that mean ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p><stage>sighing</stage>It meant , “ There 's no fool like an old fool . ”</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>She looks away . He waits a little , then sighs again and leaves the window , entering a moment later by the door .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p><stage>looking up</stage>Well , Sir ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>Madame , I am a man of good family , although — although I quarrelled with my good family . I left them many years ago and took to the road . I have seen something of the world since then , but I think I must always have had at the back of my mind some dim picture of what a home was — some ancient memory , perhaps . That memory has been very strong within me these last days .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>You have liked my home , Master Johannes ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>I have liked it well .<stage>He takes out his pipe and plays a melancholy “ Cuckoo . ”</stage>Well , well — we start this afternoon .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>You want my daughter ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p><stage>sadly</stage>Not your daughter , Madame .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>What is it you want ? Are you so backward in asking ? It is not like the Master Johannes who came to my house eight days ago .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p><stage>taking his courage in his hands</stage>Madame , though I have wandered about the world , I have saved some pennies in my time . A few trifling coins — enough for middle-age . Since I have had the great honour of knowing you —<stage>He breaks of as the voice of the SINGER to full song is heard approaching .</stage>Oh , God bless that poor young fool ! Madame , I entreat you —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p><stage>rising and moving hastily away</stage>Another time , dear Johannes —<stage>she smiles very fondly at him as she goes out</stage>— another time you must tell me — all .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>The TALKER stares after her , hardly believing . Then , with an air of solemn happiness , he takes out his pipe and dances carefully but cheerfully round the room , piping to himself . The SINGER comes in singing merrily , He joins the TALKER at the end of the room , turns round with hint and trips up and down the room with him , one singing and the other piping .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>Friend , we are gay .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SINGER</speaker>
      <p>Very , very gay , Master Johannes .<stage>They turn round and go up and down the room as before .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p>Something is stirring our middle-aged blood . I feel years younger .</p>

      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p><stage>looking at the other anxiously out of the corners of his eyes</stage>What do you think has happened to us ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SINGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a similar look</stage>I — I wonder .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p><stage>nervously</stage>I suppose the fact that we are going off this afternoon — the joy of returning to our old gay life is — is affecting us ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SINGER</speaker>
      <p>I — I suppose so .<stage>Without enthusiasm</stage>Yes , that must be it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>This cauliflower existence , this settled life which even the least enterprising cabbage would find monotonous , we have had more than enough of it , my friend .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SINGER</speaker>
      <p>Yes .<stage>He sighs deeply .</stage>I sigh to think how we have wasted these eight days .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>Ah !<stage>He sighs still more deeply .</stage>However , Heaven be praised , we are for the road this afternoon .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SINGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>gloomily</stage>Heaven be praised ! It is a grand life .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p><stage>carelessly</stage>Of course , if you came to me and said , “ Johannes , ” you said , “ I left my home in a fit of melancholy five months agone ; the melancholy is cured , I will return home again ” — why , I would say , “ God bless you , Master Duke ; go your way . ” Well , I can understand such a thing happening to a man of your age , not born to the wandering as I am .</p>

      <p>Bless you , Johannes , you are a true gentleman .</p>

      <p><stage>airily</stage>Say no more , say no more .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SINGER</speaker>
      <p>But I cannot accept this sacrifice . I pledged myself to serve you for a year , and I 'll keep my pledge .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p><stage>considerably upset by this</stage>Wait a moment , Master Duke ; I have myself thought of retiring these many months past . Indeed , it was only for your sake —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SINGER</speaker>
      <p>No , no , I cannot allow it . It is only for my sake that you are saying this . We will take the road this afternoon .<stage>Heroically</stage>Indeed , I would infinitely prefer it . I am enamoured of the wandering life .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>It is a great life . It means everything to me .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>They stand side by side looking gloomily in front of them . Gradually they begin to glance towards each other ; they catch each other 's eyes — and understand each other thoroughly .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p><stage>clapping the SINGER heartily on the back</stage>I knew it , I knew it ! You and the wandering life !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SINGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>delightedly</stage>You , too , Johannes ! You 've had enough of it !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>They suddenly turn round and go up and down the room together , piping and singing . A genteel cough is heard outside the window , and the MOTHER is seen for a moment . The TALKER turns round with his pipe to his lips . They go up the room together again , and at the top the TALKER , with a wave of the hand , leaves his companion and goes out . He is seen passing the window .</stage>
     <stage>The DAUGHTER comes in .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SINGER</speaker>
      <p>Sweetheart !</p>

      <p><stage>going to him</stage>Is it all right ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SINGER</speaker>
      <p>Everything is all right , beloved .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DAUGHTER</speaker>
      <p>You have told him ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SINGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>nodding</stage>It could n't have fallen out better . He , too , was tired of wandering and wanted to settle down .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DAUGHTER</speaker>
      <p>I told mother . She seemed glad . You know , I think she seems younger about something .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Enter FIDDLER .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FIDDLER</speaker>
      <p>Are we starting this afternoon ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DAUGHTER</speaker>
      <p>Oh , Fiddler dear , do you mind very much ?<stage>She holds out her hand , and the SINGER takes it .</stage>We are n't coming at all . We — we —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SINGER</speaker>
      <p>We are getting married .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FIDDLER</speaker>
      <p><stage>nodding to herself</stage>I thought so .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DAUGHTER</speaker>
      <p>But you will come and stay with us sometimes . Oh , say you will !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SINGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>smiling at FIDDLER with great friendliness</stage>Of course she will .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>The TALKER and the MOTHER are seen coming least the windows .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FIDDLER</speaker>
      <p>There 's Johannes . I expect we shall be starting this afternoon .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>The TALKER and the MOTHER come in arm-in-arm . He bows to her and takes the floor .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p>Ladies and gentlemen , companions-in-arms , knights and ladies of the road , comrades all ,— I have the honour to make an announcement to you . The wandering company of the Red Feathers is determined from this date , likewise disbanded , or , as others would say , dissolved . “ What means this , Master Johannes ? ” I hear you say . “ Who has done this thing ? ” Ladies and gentles all , I answer you that young Cupid has done this thing . With unerring aim he has loosed his arrows . With the same happy arrow<stage>taking the MOTHER 'S hand</stage>he has pierced the hearts of this gracious lady and myself , while yonder gallant gentleman I name no names , but the perspicacious will perceive whom I mean — is about to link his life with the charming maiden who stands so modestly by his side . There is one other noble lady present to whom I have not yet referred —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FIDDLER</speaker>
      <p><stage>holding out her hand to the MOTHER</stage>I think I must go . Good-bye , and thank you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p><stage>taking her hand and patting it</stage>Wait a moment , dear .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p><stage>continuing his speech</stage>— noble lady to whom I have not yet referred . I will not hide from you the fact that she plays upon the fiddle with an elegance rarely to be heard . It is the earnest wish of<stage>swelling his chest</stage>my future wife and myself that she should take up her abode with us .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FIDDLER</speaker>
      <p>It 's very kind of you , but I do n't think —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DAUGHTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>coming across</stage>Mother , she 's going to stay with us ; she promised .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>It 's sweet of you to ask her , dear , but I think it would be much more suitable that she should live with us .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SINGER</speaker>
      <p>We should love to have her , and she could come and see you whenever she liked .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>I was going to suggest that she should live with us and come and see you sometimes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TALKER</speaker>
      <p><stage>who has been thinking deeply</stage>I have it ! What say you to this ? For six months , making in all twenty-six weeks of the year , she shall live , reside , dwell , or , as one might say , take up her habitation with us ; whereas for the other six months —<stage>They have been so busy discussing the future of the FIDDLER that they have not noticed that she is no longer there . Suddenly the sound of the fiddle is heard .</stage>What 's that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>The FIDDLER comes in , wearing her cap now with the red feather in it . She is playing a wild song , a song of the road . She is content again . She goes up the room , and as she passes them she gives them a little bend of the head and the beginnings of a grave smile . She goes out of the door , still playing ; she is still playing as she goes past the windows . They follow her with their eyes . When she is gone they still listen until the music dies in the distance .</stage>
