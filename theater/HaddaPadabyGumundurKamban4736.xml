    <head>FOREWORD</head>
    <p n="1">The value of this play lies in the fact that , beneath the surface , it vibrates with the quivering , intensely pulsating forces of life . The speeches breathe . The leading characters not only have perspicuity , but each has its own representative melodic theme . There is as music under the text , a constant accompaniment of exquisite passion , rising , sinking , and now rising once more , in a struggle with vacillating sensual pleasure and base inclination to supersede others . Around the simple action there is an atmosphere of poetry . The play opens with the superstition of olden times , in the old nurse 's tale about the life-egg , suggested to her by a crystal ball , with which the sisters are playing . Modern superstition is woven into the beautiful scene , where Hadda Padda , with heroically mastered despair , meets the herborist who talks of her plants in a calm poetic manner , reminiscent of the way Ophelia speaks of the flowers she has picked and collected .</p>
    <p n="2">The drama stands or falls with Hadda Padda , that is to say , it STANDS . She holds it with a firm hand , as the Saint in the old paintings bears the church . In her , the Iceland of ancient and modern times meets . She has more warmth , more kindness of heart , more womanly affection , than any antique figure from a Saga . She gives herself completely , resignedly . She is tender and she is mild , without being meek . In her inmost self , however , she is proud . When first this pride is touched , then hurt , and finally the very woman in her is mortally wounded , it is at once perceptible that she descends from the strong , wild women of olden times . The wildness has become resolution , the pride has become poise , the strength has remained unchanged . She plays with life and death like the heroes of a thousand years ago . She faces death without flinching , and despite all her goodness , her delicacy , her kindly love for the old and the young , for the humble and the poor , for animals and plants , at the bottom of her nature she is heathen . In life 's last moments , with death and revenge in mind , she can still pretend , invent , dupe . Such profound and exquisite womanhood , such inflexible masculine will , have hardly ever been seen combined on the stage before .</p>

    <p n="4">INTRODUCTION</p>
    <p n="5">Iceland has always been famous for the quality of her literature , although nowadays but little of it comes to our shores . It is , therefore , an especial pleasure to introduce the author of “ Hadda Padda . ”</p>
    <p n="6">Godmundur Kamban , son of a merchant of an old and well known Icelandic family , was born near Reykjavik , the capital of Iceland , on June 8 , 1888 . He was graduated twenty-two years later from the College of Reykjavik , where he received honoris causa in literature and language , the first and only time this prize has ever been awarded . While still at college , he was made assistant editor of the best known newspaper in Iceland , edited by Bjorn Jonsson , the late Prime Minister , in whose home Mr. Kamban lived during his college career . In 1910 , he proceeded to the University of Copenhagen , where he specialized in literature and received his Master 's degree . In Copenhagen , Peter Jerndorff , the famous Acteur Royal , practically regarded him as his own son . Under Jerndorff 's direction for five years , he obtained that thorough dramatic education which is so essential to the fastidious Scandinavian Theatre , and to which Ibsen also served an apprenticeship .</p>
    <p n="7">“ Hadda Padda , ” Mr. Kamban 's first dramatic work , was written in Denmark in 1912 , while he was still a student at the University of Copenhagen . Originally written in Icelandic , it was translated into Danish and submitted to the Royal Theatre , a fortress difficult of access to the newcomer . This theatre did not even fully recognise such masters as Ibsen and Bjornson until they stood on the heights of achievement . Our author was but twenty - four years old , unknown , and offering his first play .</p>
   </div>
   <set>
    <p>From the outset “ Hadda Padda ” caused the directors unexpected trouble . It took them four times as long as usual to come to a decision . They finally accepted it “ on account of its literary merit , ” but without any obligation on their part to produce it , as the scenery of the last act was of “ such daring and dangerous character . ”</p>
   </set>
   <titlePage>
    <docImprint>There was but one thing to do and Mr. Kamban did it . His play was published by Gyldendal , the most distinguished of the Scandinavian publishers . He sent a copy to Georg Brandes , as do thousands of authors from all parts of the world . Next evening he received a letter from the great critic , telling him that he had read the play , and asking Mr. Kamban to call on him at his home . A few days later , when he spent four hours with Brandes at and after table , the latter told him that he received on an average twelve volumes a day from different authors of every nationality , and were he to do nothing else , he could not read even one twelfth of them . “ But I am going to write an article about your play , ” he concluded . Thus was Mr. Kamban 's place as an artist assured . In spite of the unanimous recognition the play received from the press , the theatre still refused to produce it , as nearly all the authorities agreed that it would be “ hardly possible to stage . ” Finally , the new chief of the theatre , Count F. Brockenhuus - Schack , determined to carry the matter through . The author then undertook to stage the play , designed the scenes , and arranged the mise-en-scene to the minutest detail . On November 14 ,<date>1914</date>, the first performance took place . He sat in the latticed author 's box . The first three acts went smoothly , interrupted at times by applause . The fourth act , the one talked about and difficult , was still to come . The fate of the play depended on this act . The curtain rose , and with the slowness of life the act proceeded . The silence of the audience was uncanny . Toward the end , the foremost theatrical critic of the city rose to his feet and raised his hand as if in horror . The curtain fell . Not a hand stirred . A whole minute elapsed and Mr. Kamban left the box , refusing to himself to admit the failure . Then suddenly a wild enthusiasm broke loose and lasted several minutes . According to the regulations — unique in Europe — of the Royal Theatre , the curtain may not be raised for any author or actor except at a jubilee . The public , however , refused to leave the theatre till the manager had escorted Mr. Kamban to the dais in front of the curtain , and there he expressed his thanks to the audience .</docImprint>

   <performance>After four months in Copenhagen , “ Hadda Padda ” toured the Scandinavian Countries , and preparations were being made for its production in Germany , when the war broke out , and the German theatres were indefinitely closed to foreign dramatists . That is why , two years ago , he came to America . K .</performance>

    <head type="act">ACT I</head>
    <stage>A luxuriously furnished drawing-room in the house of the Town Judge . On the right , in front , a door . In the middle rear an open door draped with rich , heavy , deep-red curtains . On the left a large window . In the corner , between the window and the door , a grand piano , behind which stands a palm , the leaves spreading over the piano . In front , on the left , a divan . Alongside of it is a pedestal with a black terra cotta statue on it .</stage>
    <stage>Hadda Padda and Kristrun are sitting toward the front , in large deep arm-chairs , throwing a crystal ball to each other . Near by is a small table , covered with a piece of velvet , on which the ball had lain . Hadda Padda is very sunburnt . ) RANNVEIG [ enters from behind . She is knitting , keeping the ball of yarn under her arm . She is dressed in an Icelandic costume ] . Take care ! Do n't drop the ball ! [ Drops a stitch , takes it up again — smiles . ] Who knows — maybe it is your life-egg , children !</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>Life-egg ! ... Is that a fairy-tale ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RANNVEIG</speaker>
     <p>Have n't you ever heard it ? Come , let me tell you about it .<stage>Takes a chair and sits down beside them .</stage>Once upon a time there lived two giantesses who were sisters . One day , they lured a young prince to them . They let the prince sleep under a coverlet woven of gold , while they themselves slept under one woven of silver . When at last the prince pledged himself in marriage to one of them , he made them tell him how they spent the day in the forest . They went hunting deer and birds , and when they rested , they sat down under an oak , and threw their life-egg to each other . If they broke it they both would die . The next day , the prince went to the forest , and saw the sisters sitting there , under the oak . One of them was holding a golden egg in her hand , and just as she tossed it into the air , he hurled his spear . It hit the egg , and broke it — the giantesses fell down , dead .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>Brave giantesses who dared to treat your sacred possession so heedlessly !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RANNVEIG</speaker>
     <p>One does not hear the footstep of vengeance . It came to them unexpectedly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>How I wish my whole fate were held in this ball .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RANNVEIG</speaker>
     <p>What would you do if it were ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>I would lay it gently in the hand of the man I loved , saying : Take it to a safe place !— and I would shut my eyes — while he were searching for the place .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RANNVEIG</speaker>
     <p>If my sister were here , perhaps she could read your fate in the ball , both the past and the future ... Who knows , but the whole Universe may be mirrored in this one glass globe .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>That 's your favorite superstition .<stage>Smiling surreptitiously .</stage>Tell me , Veiga — have n't you a life-egg ?<stage>Turns abruptly from her , throwing the ball to Hadda .</stage>RANNVEIG<stage>evasively</stage>I had one once . ... KRISTRUN<stage>catching the ball</stage>Then you have n't it any more ?</p>

     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>And you are still alive ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RANNVEIG</speaker>
     <p>He who lived once in happiness dies twice .<stage>Sees the sisters throw the ball faster and faster .</stage>Do n't throw the ball so carelessly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>Be calm . The prince wo n't come . And even if he came — do you think we have the same life-egg , I and Hrafnhild ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RANNVEIG</speaker>
     <p>Now stop making fun of me ! The ball may hit you in the face — there now !— that 's enough !— you nearly dazed my Hadda . It is strange to like to do this .<stage>Picks up the ball , and puts it back on the velvet .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>Tell me , Veiga , perhaps your life-egg was a young man 's heart . ...</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RANNVEIG</speaker>
     <p>We wo n't talk about it any more .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>And how did it break ? RANNVEIG<stage>enraged</stage>At least I did n't play with it . I never played with anybody else 's feelings .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>There — there , do n't snarl so , you 're simply barking — bow , wow ! RANNVEIG<stage>furious</stage>How many have you made fools of already ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>Let me see —.<stage>Counts on her fingers .</stage>One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten ,<stage>throws off one shoe , and counts on her toes</stage>eleven ... twelve ... thirteen — ah ! here 's a hole in my stocking . Thirteen ! Thirteen , Veiga dear ! The unlucky number ! Wonderful ! I 'll never throw him over !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RANNVEIG</speaker>
     <p>You 're horribly flippant , Kristrun . KRISTRUN<stage>sits down at the small table , shades her face as she looks into the ball</stage>Fancy , Veiga , I see your whole fate in the ball .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RANNVEIG</speaker>
     <p>Leave the crystal alone , it wo n't hurt you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>As sure as I live — I can see the most trivial events in your life . I see you by day , in this room here , when your nose begins to itch , and you steal into the kitchen to take a pinch of snuff . I see . ...<stage>Looks up ; Rannveig has come up to her , and is about to strike her .</stage>KRISTRUN<stage>slipping away from her</stage>Look out , the snuff is dripping from your nose !<stage>Runs out , Rannveig shuts the door behind her , and turns around . She passes her finger under her nose , looks at it , shakes her head .</stage></p>

     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>You and Runa do n't seem to get on any better since</l>
      <l>I 've been away .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RANNVEIG</speaker>
     <p>We have never gotten along together . ... I do n't understand the young people nowadays . They are merely butterflies - - all of them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>You once told me , dear , that sometime in every one 's life there comes a wishing hour . Maybe Runa had hers when she wished for the joy of living .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RANNVEIG</speaker>
     <p>It 's a strange joy then , to want to make other people miserable ! To use the beauty God has given her , against those who cannot resist it . ... Why do you suppose the new engineer has stopped coming here since the son of the Chief Justice returned from Copenhagen — and he seemed like such a sweet boy too ! It is not the first or the second time she has changed her mind .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>When a true and deep love comes to her , she will not change her mind .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RANNVEIG</speaker>
     <p>It 's no use to stand up for her ; she wheedles them all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>But still you told me , dear , that you would be fonder of me if I did not marry .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RANNVEIG</speaker>
     <p>How can you say that , Hadda dear ? I said that marriage does n't always bring happiness . HADDA PADDA . I know . You told me that only to console me , because I am now twenty-six years old . Runa is nineteen , prettier than most girls , and a wild little imp , surrounded by young men all the time . And they play upon her vanity only to make her cruel .<stage>Stands up .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RANNVEIG</speaker>
     <p>At her age you were prettier , and are , still , but you were not like that . No , she has n't your character . KRISTRUN<stage>enters from behind</stage>The prince is coming !<stage>Rannveig gathers her knitting , and drops the yarn . Kristrun jumps at it like a cat , and catches it .</stage>Now I 'll dance for you , Veiga dear .<stage>She whirls around her , singing , yarn in hand , twisting the thread around the old woman . They listen for footsteps . Rannveig slips out , on the right , entangled in the yarn , Kristrun following .</stage>INGOLF<stage>enters . Like Hadda , he is sunburnt</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>How do you do ! You promised to be here earlier , dear .<stage>Kisses him .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>What time is it ?<stage>About to take out his watch .</stage>HADDA PADDA<stage>catching his hands</stage>I do n't know . But I felt the moment slipping by , when you should have been here . INGOLF<stage>kisses her again</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>While I was sitting there , in the arm-chair , waiting for you , I closed my eyes , and do you know what I saw ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>No . HADDA PADDA<stage>pointing to the crystal</stage>I saw the crystal ball through my eyelashes . INGOLF<stage>smiling</stage>Then you did not close your eyes —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>No , I cheated .<stage>They laugh .</stage>and then I began to throw the crystal ball to Runa , do you know why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>No —?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>So as to lure back an old recollection . ... Do you remember , it was your last winter at the Latin school . One day you came home , and we two were alone in the room here , you took the ball , threw it to me , and called : WISHING —! I caught it , and said :— STONE ! And so we continued to play , till you called HADDA ! I did n't quite follow your trick at first , but caught the word : PADDA ! Then you laughed and said : From now on , you shall never be called anything but HADDA PADDA . Do you remember ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>I do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Everybody calls me that now , except my nurse . RANNVEIG<stage>peeping in through the curtain</stage>Do n't let me hear that name . Hf ! Padda ! That 's an insect !<stage>Disappears .</stage>HADDA PADDA<stage>walks gently forth , and rolls the door back</stage>Then I asked you what christening gift I was to have . You gave me your first kiss . INGOLF<stage>sits down on the divan , takes Hadda on his knee</stage>Hadda Padda ! You do n't know how I love that name . You do n't know how many times I have wrapped you in it , as in some fantastic mantle . After you had left Copenhagen last spring , and I sat reading all the live-long day , until at last I went to bed , my lips did not close on your name , till my eyes had closed on your picture .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>You must never call me anything but that . Each time you say it , it brings back the joy of your first kiss .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Were you really in love with me then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>You do n't know ? ... Then I did succeed in hiding it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Why did you hide it , Hadda ? Why , I almost believed you bore me a grudge . You seemed to hold more aloof each day .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>And even that did not betray me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Why did you hide it , Hadda ?<stage>Footsteps are heard outside .</stage>HADDA PADDA<stage>kisses Ingolf hastily , gets up , and seats herself at his side , takes his hand</stage>Do n't you understand , dear , I was afraid of knowing the certainty . The stronger my love grew , the more carefully I had to hide it . I dared not risk those beautiful dream-children of uncertainty for a disguised certainty . Whenever we talked together , and you looked up at me , I was startled . I thought you understood , and your hurried glance reached me only after the fear of seeing the answer in it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>You , the most sincere of women , could cherish so strong a love and seem so cold .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Now I have made too great a virtue of my love . Some of my reserve was pride . Just think , you lived with us during your entire schooltime , and in the summer sister and I were by turns at your home . We grew up , you , handsome and manly , and a lord of pleasures ; and you always seemed to be careful not to pay me greater attention than the other girls , especially at parties . That was why I drew back .— I was eighteen , you were twenty ; you were graduated and went abroad . And poor , proud little Hadda Padda was left alone .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Poor proud little Hadda Padda .<stage>They laugh .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Then when you came back the next spring , it was Kristrun 's turn to go to the country . And since then , you have not been home during the summer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>And when you went to Copenhagen the following winter , it just happened to be the only year I stayed home .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Then I thought it surely was the will of fate to separate us . But I loved you even more . I could not give up hope . Not even when you wrote home , the year before last , that you had decided to live abroad . I got that news on the shortest day of the year . I watched the twilight darken into night until the very blackness swam before my eyes in blood-red spots . It was then I made up my mind to go .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Yes , you came in the autumn .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>And it was not before December , at a meeting of the Icelandic Society — we sat alone , in an outer room . Then I placed my fate in your hand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Then you placed your hand in mine .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Then I placed my life in your hand . I willed all my power into my hand and placed it in yours . That instant , nothing but my hand lived . Had you thrust it away , I would not now be living .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>How silently happiness steals upon us . We sat alone in the room , far from the din of the dance . Then it came . I heard its tread in the quiver of your breath . ... Then I felt it in my hand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>And yet you sat there immovable , and made the very seconds fight for my life . When I held your hand , I was afraid lest a single finger tremble — till you closed your hand around my wrist , and drew me to you .<stage>She leans toward him .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Do you know what attracted me most to you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>You do n't know yourself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Why not ...?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Because you love me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>But I think I know now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Well , what is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>The thing that kept us apart so long .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>And that is ? ...</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Your reticence . That awaiting attitude you just called pride . I have known other women . They came to me without first listening to my heart ... but you did not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>I looked into your eyes . I saw the flame in them increase , the longer they gazed at me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>The human heart is like the mountains : they give no echo if we get too near . HADDA PADDA<stage>lets herself slide down at Ingolf 's knees , so that he sits bending over her</stage>Let me look at you for a long time .— How long your eyelashes are ! Each time you blink , it is as though invisible petals were sprinkled upon me . INGOLF<stage>closing her hands in his</stage>Now you have no hands . ... Shall I give them to you again ?<stage>Lets go , but looks at her one hand lying in his .</stage>Your nails have a tinge like that of ice in sunshine . HADDA PADDA<stage>withdraws her hand , laughing , and gets up</stage>I am just thinking ...</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>What are you thinking ? HADDA PADDA<stage>walks a few steps and stops behind him</stage>I was lying down outside in the garden to-day . I could not keep awake . I dreamed I stood outside the Cathedral . It was dark inside , but all along the church floor , on either side , was a straight row of unlit candles . I remember all the white soft wicks , peeping half out , waiting for light . Then a sudden gust of wind swept through the whole church , and as it grazed the wicks , all the candles were lighted . INGOLF<stage>keeps silent</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>What do you think the dream means ? I think it means happiness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>You must not deprive your dream of its beauty by interpreting it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Happiness comes to us like a beautiful dream that we do n't dare to interpret .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>You have promised to trust me as much as you love me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>I see the future mirrored in those days we lived together .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>I love you , Hadda Padda .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Your words are the light , your caresses are the warmth . Give me both , Ingolf . Kiss me . INGOLF<stage>kisses her</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>And I should not trust you ? Has not a sacred hour welded our hearts together ? And have you not placed your life in my hands ?— Do you remember last summer , when I visited your home , how you lowered me with a rope down the Angelica Gorge ? I have not often lived so exquisite an hour . Then I became quite foolhardy . When I came up again , I asked you to go down and let me hold the rope for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>I hardly believed you were as strong as you are .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>If you had not had courage to go down by my hands , I am not quite sure that I could be so fond of you . I shall never forget that moment . I saw you come up again with an angelica crown on your head . I saw you rise up like a green-crowned sea-god from the deep .—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>I can n't bear the thought that I shall leave you in a few days . HADDA PADDA<stage>smiles</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>You smile ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>I am thinking of something . Shall I tell you ? LITTLE SKULI<stage>comes rushing in from the right</stage>Hadda Padda ! Have you seen —? Ah , Ingolf , are you here ?<stage>Runs straight up to Ingolf , catching hold of both his hands</stage>Why did you leave home so soon , Ingolf ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Because I wanted to go to Copenhagen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Skuli dear , will you be a good boy and make me a ship ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LITTLE SKULI</speaker>
     <p>Oh no , not now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Oh yes , your last ship was so well cut out , with great big masts .<stage>Pats him .</stage>You 're a dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Then you 'll be allowed to come along with us to the country next summer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>And sit in front , on the Sheriff 's horse , many , many times .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LITTLE SKULI</speaker>
     <p>Then will the Sheriff give me a sheep again ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Yes , my little friend , father will give you a sheep , and I will give you one too ; I 'll give you one with pretty rounded horns .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LITTLE SKULI</speaker>
     <p>Does it butt ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>O , of course not , it eats bread from your hand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LITTLE SKULI</speaker>
     <p>Then I 'll saw its horns off , and give them to Sigga - - she has lots of horns she plays sheep with .<stage>Laughter .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Well , are you going to make that ship ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LITTLE SKULI</speaker>
     <p>Are you the one who gets all Hadda Padda 's ships ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Well , I daresay I get most of them .— What makes you think so ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LITTLE SKULI</speaker>
     <p>Because , whenever she is with you , she always wants me to make ships .<stage>Ingolf and Hadda look at each other and laugh .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Yes , she knows I am very fond of your ships .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LITTLE SKULI</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Then I 'll make ships for you often .</l>
      <stage>Runs out , Ingolf and Hadda still laughing .</stage>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>What was it you were going to tell me before ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Something that ...</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>That ..?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>That ...</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Are you teasing me ? RANNVEIG<stage>enters from the back , knitting , sits down</stage>What a lovely day it is .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Veiga , dear , you promised to darn my lilac stockings for me . I have n't any to wear to-morrow . RANNVEIG<stage>considering</stage>How about the yellow ones ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Runa must have taken them ; I could n't find them . RANNVEIG<stage>gets up</stage>Well , I can n't let you go barefooted .<stage>Goes out .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>You are shrewd , Hadda Padda !— Now , tell it to me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>First , kiss me ! INGOLF<stage>kisses her</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Do you think you will miss me very much when you are gone ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>How can you ask ? RANNVEIG<stage>enters from the back , with the stockings in her hand</stage>I knew as much . I was right .—<stage>Sees them embracing .</stage>— I might have saved myself the trouble of looking for the stockings .<stage>Turns round , and goes out .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Ingolf !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Yes —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Now listen :— THE JUDGE<stage>enters from the back</stage>INGOLF<stage>looks impatiently at his watch , and walks toward the door on the right .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE JUDGE</speaker>
     <p>Are you going out , Ingolf ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>I 'm just going up to my room . I have a letter to answer .<stage>Goes out .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE JUDGE</speaker>
     <p>Well , my dear , to-morrow is the great day . HADDA PADDA . How good you are , father , to make me feel your gladness as you do . THE JUDGE<stage>takes her to his side , and sits down with her</stage>You happy child ! I can n't believe that you are grown up . It is as if I were beginning to realise it now , for the first time . But still , I shall have you one year more .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Father !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE JUDGE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Father . ...!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE JUDGE</speaker>
     <p>What is the matter , dear ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>There is something I want to ask you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE JUDGE</speaker>
     <p>And that is ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>I want to ask you —<stage>Stops abruptly .</stage>LADY ANNA<stage>enters from the back</stage>THE JUDGE<stage>to Hadda</stage>What did you want to ask me ?<stage>Smiles to his wife .</stage>Something mother may not hear ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>No , something I have to ask both of you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE JUDGE</speaker>
     <p>Let us hear it , then .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>It is a very great favor , but you must not say no .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE JUDGE</speaker>
     <p>Ask it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY ANNA</speaker>
     <p>Well , what is it ?<stage>She has taken some work from the basket , and sits down to sew .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>I want you to let me go to Copenhagen again . I want to go with Ingolf .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE JUDGE</speaker>
     <p>Now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Yes , now , Tuesday .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY ANNA</speaker>
     <p>You are not in earnest , Hrafnhild . You know , Kristrun is going to leave for England next month , your brother has written for her . And she has n't been abroad yet , while you have been twice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Nor do I want her to abandon her plan .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY ANNA</speaker>
     <p>But do you want me to do without both of you at the same time ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Would that be hard for you , mother ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY ANNA</speaker>
     <p>Hard — it would be impossible . With all the parties we have , I must have one of you at home .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE JUDGE</speaker>
     <p>Of course , it would be difficult for mother to manage without your assistance — since Kristrun is going away .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY ANNA</speaker>
     <p>I never thought of that , Hrafnhild . Besides , I think it in good taste , since your engagement will be announced to-morrow before Ingolf leaves , for you to remain at home this year till he has passed his examination and comes back .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Yes , that would be in very good taste , if I could only bear it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY ANNA</speaker>
     <p>You must also remember that you would disturb him in his studies , if you were with him this winter . ... Just when he wants to concentrate on his work .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>I want to make his work easier — that 's just what I want to do ,</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY ANNA</speaker>
     <p>I can n't do without you , Hadda . THE JUDGE<stage>pats his wife on the cheek</stage>If our dear little Hadda Padda were sick , we would have to get one girl more in the house . And then , if she had to go away for a year to recover , and we were waiting for her to come back strong and healthy — do n't you think we would readily allow her to go ? HADDA PADDA<stage>throws her arms around his neck</stage>Father , I was sure that you ...</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY ANNA</speaker>
     <p>That would be quite another thing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE JUDGE</speaker>
     <p>Then you would realise that you COULD do without her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY ANNA</speaker>
     <p>But you do n't mean , that any one else can fill her place —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Mother , you think so much of Helga . I have talked to her , and she is willing to help you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE JUDGE</speaker>
     <p>There you are ! Can you imagine any one better ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY ANNA</speaker>
     <p>It is not only that — If they were married , it would be quite proper for them to go abroad together . HADDA PADDA<stage>looks angrily at her mother , but says nothing</stage>THE JUDGE<stage>discovers it . Walks up to his wife , and lays his arm on her shoulder</stage>We have not grown so old as you would have us .<stage>Heartily .</stage>Perhaps then , it is not proper for an old venerable judge to be as much in love with his silver-haired wife as when they were engaged . But he can n't help it , and that 's just the reason , he still understands love in young people .<stage>To Hadda .</stage>Ask your mother once more to let you go . Maybe she will when she knows you have my consent .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY ANNA</speaker>
     <p>Well , I see what this is leading to . You know I do n't usually oppose you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Father , you 're always so good to me .</l>
      <stage>Kisses him .</stage>
      <l>THE JUDGE</l>
      <stage>in a whisper to Hadda</stage>
      <l>Now kiss your mother too !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Nice mother ! I will be twice as much pleasure to you when I come back .<stage>Kisses her .</stage>LITTLE SKULI<stage>enters</stage>Hadda Padda , do you want the ship to have two or three masts ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Now let me see , my boy .<stage>Goes out with him .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE JUDGE</speaker>
     <p>To-morrow — that will be a happy day . At last I shall see my fondest wish fulfilled , mine and my dear old friend 's — that our children should belong to each other . I never suspected this would happen when Hrafnhild went abroad last year .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY ANNA</speaker>
     <p>And now she is to go with him again . She has much to thank her father for .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE JUDGE</speaker>
     <p>I think time has kept them apart long enough .— I had a long talk with Helga the other day — they are very good friends , you know , and she was in Copenhagen at the same time as Hadda last year . She told me that Ingolf had quite given up his studies , and it was Hadda Padda who made him take them up again . ... From Christmas on , last year , he studied from morning to night ,— and now he will pass his examination , and begin here as an attorney . Then they will probably marry next autumn . LADY ANNA<stage>nods</stage>He must be kind to Hrafnhild — she is more than just fond of him . Have you noticed that she is beginning to resemble him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE JUDGE</speaker>
     <p>Now , in spite of everything , I think we are beginning to grow old ; our sight is failing us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY ANNA</speaker>
     <p>Not my sight . Listen to me . You should have seen her with the flowers this summer while she was home . When she watered them , she talked with them as if they could understand her . It was as if she returned every rise of fragrance with a smile . And the flowers thrived and blossomed , as if they absorbed her tenderness .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>THE JUDGE</speaker>
     <p>I have noticed something else lately : that every time she comes into a room it is as though the air were filled with the beauty of peace . I could have myself blindfolded , and all Reykavik could walk through the room on soles of velvet — when SHE entered I could recognize her by the delightful calm that accompanies her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY ANNA</speaker>
     <p>This excessive love ... it is worrying me . Maybe it was mostly on that account that I delayed agreeing to her departure .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE JUDGE</speaker>
     <p>There are so many things that worry you . Why does n't Ingolf come back ?<stage>Kisses her on the cheek .</stage>I will talk to him about it .<stage>Goes out .</stage>RANNVEIG<stage>enters</stage>The servants want to know how many places to lay for dinner . LADY ANNA<stage>putting aside her needlework</stage>Well , I 'm coming —<stage>Goes out .</stage>RANNVEIG<stage>walks slowly to the centre of the room , stands looking at the terra cotta statue</stage>When you dream something , you do n't want to come true , you ought to tell it to some one — better to a stone than to no one .<stage>Hands folded , she walks slowly up to the statue , whispering in its ear ,</stage>I dreamed of a beautiful and marvellous diamond palace . I walked around it , but it had no doors . No one could get in . If any one were inside , he could not get out . I heard weeping inside the palace . It seemed to tear my heart . I recognised the weeping ?—<stage>She passes her hand over her eyes , looks at the statue a long time , walks away from it , looks back at it once more , and goes out . In the doorway she encounters Hadda , looks at her , pats her cheek , and disappears .</stage>HADDA PADDA<stage>enters with a water jug in her hand , walks up to a flower in the window</stage>INGOLF<stage>enters and steals up to her</stage></p>

     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Now I know the secret . You are going with me to Copenhagen . Hadda Padda , Hadda Padda , I love you ! Let me sing to you .<stage>He takes both her hands and while he sings , wild with joy , she hums the tune .</stage>You shall stand upon my skis , In a mad precipitation We , together , cleave the breeze : We will , My daffodil ! To the place where we 'll abide On my white horse you 'll be riding : Clouds of dust the moon will hide — They will , My daffodil !<stage>He lifts her in his arms . The sun is shining through the window and lights up the room .</stage>HADDA PADDA<stage>stretches her arms toward the light</stage>It is as though I had wings .<stage>Turns round in his arms , and folds him in her embrace .</stage>I will fly to my happiness .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>THE SHERIFF</speaker>
     <p>We expect quite a few people over the week-end . I had a letter from Arni , the tourist guide , who says he 'll be here with six tourists next Sunday .</p>

     <speaker>LADY MARGARET</speaker>
     <p>Yes , it is true , every summer we have more and more guests . But , what difference does it make — The rooms of Breidabol are still large enough . OLOF<stage>to Steindor</stage>You can room with Ingolf for the present .<stage>To Hadda .</stage>And I 'll move in with you . Then we 'll have an extra room .</p>

     <speaker>THE SHERIFF</speaker>
     <p>My , but will you really be here three weeks to - morrow ? It 's so good to have both sisters at the same time . You have n't been here together since you were tiny little tots — just so high !</p>

     <speaker>OLOF</speaker>
     <p>Yes , Hadda dear .<stage>Takes her arm — they go .

Right now !<stage>Ingolf looks at her , smiling , casts a glance at the door and through the window , as he approaches the chaise-longue . Kristrun sits gracefully down on his shoulder . Her dress is drawn rather tightly , so that one of her legs shows . He takes hold of her leg to support her , and starts walking around the table .</stage>KRISTRUN<stage>raises her head and looks into his eyes</stage>Will you be a good boy and take hold above the dress .<stage>Lets go , and raises herself .</stage>You silly boy , do you think you may hold me by my leg ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Well — I do n't want to hold you by your leg ! KRISTRUN<stage>grasps him around the shoulder</stage>You silly boy ! Do you think you can lower your shoulder !

     <p>To beat Ingolf ! No indeed !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>Doddi dear , you do it !<stage>Doddi runs for the whip , and gives it to her . She swings the whip around , so that it whizzes in the air . As Ingolf passes the piano , she runs the knob of the whip along the key-board .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LITTLE SKULI</speaker>
     <p>Let 's go , Doddi .<stage>They go out .</stage></p>

     <p>Are you tired ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>I seem to feel lighter , in holding you on my shoulder .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>Hf —! Lighter ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Yes , certainly !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>Hf —! In carrying me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>In feeling the weight of your body . In that way , I could bear you to the end of the world . KRISTRUN<stage>hops down , looks straight into his eyes</stage>Really now , I refuse to listen to such foolishness . ... Only look kindly at me once , instead of bearing me to the end of the world .<stage>Sits down .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Kindly !— Kristrun , do I deserve the cruelty you have shown me these last days .— Every moment of the day you have felt my soul streaming out to you , yet you choose the most common terms to describe my feelings , and pretend not to recognize them . I have been inventing new pet-names for you all the time , so that no one should have as pretty a name as you , so that you should have a prettier name to-day than you had yesterday . You pretend not to hear them . I have shown you every tenderness , but by your pretence you keep it at sword 's length from you . You have been torturing me in this way now for three days . ... Look kindly at you ! Why , every time I look at you , you see my eyes shine through a tearfilled dimness ...</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>Have you seen it in the glass ? INGOLF<stage>keeps silent for a while , bites his lips , turns away from her</stage>Some women should not be allowed to be pretty . KRISTRUN<stage>laughs , dangling her foot</stage>Quite right . But men in turn , ought to be obliged to be handsome — otherwise they are disgusting .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Kristrun ! Is it quite impossible to talk seriously with you ? Is there nothing so sacred to you that you would n't ridicule it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>Well —?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>No , I suppose there is not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps more than you think .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Why do you let me suffer , then ? Have n't I confessed my love to you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>No , you have n't . INGOLF<stage>sits down at her side . While he speaks she sits erect in the chair , her hands folded in her lap , her head raised . A bright smile plays on her half-open lips . It is as if she were listening to a beautiful tale</stage>Are you waiting for me to say just the words : I love you ! Were n't there moments when I made a greater confession , when one sigh , one glance , told you more than these words ? But you are not satisfied with hearing a love like the fluttering of wings in the dead of night , you want to hear it sound like a clarion call in your ears : I love you , I love you ! ... To-day I saw you standing at the piano , there ; each feature in your face was in repose , each move blended softly into fine lines . I saw you as one of those works of art of an ancient master , which could lure the infidel to believe in the resurrection of the body . What was my surprise , when I saw you move , and walk across the floor ! ... Even your dress , altering its folds with the rhythm of your step , becomes mysterious , like the sea — floating , as it were , with life itself . ... Only that fleeting sparkle from your eyes as you roll them upward ... Or when you are lying down , and you stretch your foot out — so supple , that the tension on your arch makes your instep seem higher ... And then your everlasting vivacity : when you laugh , the air seems to float with tiny fairies ... I love you , Kristrun , only you , you , you .<stage>Kristrun still gazes into space , dreamily . Ingolf reaches hesitatingly for her hand ; discreetly , she withdraws it .</stage>INGOLF<stage>gets up</stage>Did you lie to me , Kristrun ? The other night , when I told you , without speaking , for the first time , just as plainly as now with words , that I loved you : we heard footsteps , you ran away , you turned around and kissed me , and disappeared — did this sweet kiss then lie , was it only a moment 's impulse that played with a sacred feeling ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>It was not , Ingolf .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>But —?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>It was a moment 's impulse that played with a moment 's impulse .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps for you , but not for me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>I thought your silent confession that evening was sincere . The next day , I overheard a conversation between you and Hrafnhild , you did n't know I was there . Perhaps she has noticed the change in you . She used her voice , her intelligence , her beauty , her whole appeal , to get your caresses . And she got them , many and warm .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>You yourself say that I have changed . You yourself say that I love you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>I myself say that you must choose between us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>My heart has chosen , Kristrun . And now my hand chooses .<stage>He slowly takes the ring off his finger .</stage>Are you satisfied now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>Why do you ask so sadly ? Do you do this half-heartedly ? ... I do n't know whether I can trust you . Only yesterday , when she called you away from me , my heart throbbed with joy . The air about me sang : It is you he loves ! But after a while , when she came out , she passed me with a look of supremacy in her eyes . I saw it , I saw it ... you are completely in her power .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Before the sun sets to-night , you will have to take back those words .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>I fear the strength of her words when she pleads her own cause . It is as though she could charm you into her power by some magic . Do you know what she did yesterday ? She came up to me afterwards , and tried to arouse my anger , and so sure was she of her victory , that she gloried in it . She said that I could flirt with any one I wanted — she held the love of the finest man in Iceland .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Now do you think she said it because she was so sure ? KRISTRUN<stage>does not answer</stage>“ SHE held the love of the finest man in Iceland ! ... ” Do you love me , Ingolf ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>You do n't need to ask , Kristrun .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>Do you love me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>I love you . KRISTRUN<stage>runs to the chaise-longue , and throws herself upon it ; she sobs audibly</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>What is the matter with you , Kristrun ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>Why do n't you take me in your arms ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Now I am — Do you still doubt ? I lived behind a dark , dark wall . Through a crack in the wall a streak of light came in . I loved this streak . Then one day the wall tumbled down , and I bathed in a white sea of sunshine . Now I see that I only cared for Hrafnhild because of the natural likeness between you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>Do you think I would ever have let you suspect that I cared for you , if I did not know that you had stopped loving Hrafnhild . I began to care for you a long time ago , Ingolf . When I saw how happy Hrafnhild was , it seemed to dawn upon me how splendid you are . Every one envied her . You can imagine how I tried to crush my love . But it grew stronger each day ,— it grew like a thorn into my heart . Yet , that did not matter . As long as I knew you loved Hrafnhild , I felt a greater obligation to my sister than to my love . But not any longer . Even were I to sacrifice all now , what would she gain , since you do n't care for her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>I 'll try to break off our engagement as gently as possible .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>You promised to do it , before the sun sets to-night .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Surely , when I tell her I do n't love her , she wo n't try to hold me any longer . KRISTRUN<stage>looks at him suspiciously . In order to evade her glance , he bends over and takes her in his arms</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>I will raise you , slowly and carefully , like a cup brimful of intoxicating wine .<stage>Kisses her a long time . Raises her up . They hear footsteps outside , and listen .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>It is Hrafnhild .<stage>Loosens his embrace .</stage>KRISTRUN<stage>throws her arms around his neck , and clings to him</stage>Why do n't you want her to see ? INGOLF<stage>trying to free himself</stage>You are not so heartless , Kristrun ! HADDA PADDA<stage>opens the door . In her hand , she has a bouquet of violets , freshly gathered . A subdued smile lights up her face . As soon as she looks in , her features become distorted with horror . She takes half a step backwards , holding her hand before her eyes , as if to ward off a blow . A feeble cry , filled with pain , as if torn by force from the throat is expressed in the word No !</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>It is I you love ! It is I you love ! INGOLF<stage>tears himself away</stage>Let me talk to Hrafnhild alone . Hadda Padda stands motionless in the doorway , so that Kristrun has to pass her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>May I close the door and talk to you ?<stage>Hadda Padda moves within the door frame , and leans against it .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Hadda , you have seen now that I am no longer worthy of your love .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>I have seen nothing .<stage>Throws the bouquet on the table , and sits down on the chaise-longue , with her face turned toward the window .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Do n't say that , Hrafnhild . Even forgiveness demands return , and I cannot return yours . HADDA PADDA<stage>Her whole frame trembling</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>I did n't think you could mistake my attitude these last few days .<stage>Both keep silent .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>But now - ? from to-day on , you must try to forget me . HADDA PADDA<stage>gets up</stage>Forget —? why should I forget my lover ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Because he cannot be your lover any longer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Yes , he can ; he promised . He promised to love me all my life .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>He did not know what he promised . HADDA PADDA<stage>sees Ingolf 's hand without the ring , grasps it with horror , whispers</stage>What have you done ?— Ingolf , it cannot be true . It is not she you love . I saw you push her from you , when she clung about your neck . Say she told you a lie , when she cried . Only say something — say that suddenly an earthquake came , and she threw herself in your arms from fear . I 'll believe you . INGOLF<stage>shakes his head .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Ingolf , how could you be so hard ?</l>
      <stage>Hides her face .</stage>
      <l>Any other , any other . ? - But she !</l>
      <stage>Weeps bitterly .</stage>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>It is not that , Hrafnhild . Now let us talk calmly . Even if you could , would you continue to be tied to a man who does not love you any longer ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>She has separated us . She has caught you in the net of her wantonness . You , too , Ingolf , you , too . ... When I looked at you , you could see my love in my eyes . But she , she looked at you through a veil of wantonness , so that your imagination might create what it liked behind it —? was that what attracted you ? I gave you all that I had . She took back with the left hand what she had given with her right — was that what attracted you ? Ingolf , do you value such a character ? Do n't you know how she is ? I know you think she loves you . So she has told them all . Her love is a remorseless beast of prey . She does not even spare her sister , though she knows you are the only man I ever loved . But she MUST have this triumph — this one , too . Are you going to yield to it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>You are mistaken , Hrafnhild . It is not she who parts us . I feel that even if she did not exist , I could no longer love you as before .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Have n't I seen you in each other 's arms ? Had it been any one else , Ingolf , any one else , I might have tried to bear it ; but SHE , in YOUR arms , that thought I cannot endure ... I have no enemy but her . The blood that flows in her veins deceives . It understands the secrets of kinship , and knows what weapons can beat me . ... She was but a little girl when I saw the smile of the conqueror in her look , if she felt that young men who called on us paid her greater attentions than me . But it did not touch me . I was no rival . In my heart , there was only place for you . Do n't you see what life would be for me , should she triumph now , too . INGOLF<stage>keeps silent .</stage>HADDA PADDA<stage>kneels down , grasping his knee</stage>Ingolf , for nine years have I run up the stairs at home , just as you did , on the day you went away — two steps at a time .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Ingolf , I laid bare my love , to clothe yours . I did it , so that no one could take you from me . Do you remember when I gave you all a woman can give ? The past closed behind me , and I was a different being . I took your head in both my hands . “ Now you must always be kind to me , ” I said . “ Always , ” you said . You are not kind to me now , Ingolf . Had you not stripped me of the only support which a woman must have to bear life alone , I might have been able to endure it . But you have awakened passions hidden in me , from the very depths of my nature . Whenever you were away , they cried out for you with voices like children .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Stop , Hrafnhild . I gave you my word , it is true ; but since I no longer care for you , will you still hold me to an old promise that was made when I loved you ? HADDA PADDA<stage>gets up</stage>Not an old one , Ingolf . You are n't telling the truth now .<stage>Pointing out of the window .</stage>Is it old , the water that flows down the river ? Has n't every day we have lived together been a renewal of this promise ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Maybe , but one day the water stopped flowing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Now you have spoken the terrible truth . Your love was not rich enough , and you knew it from the first . You are not deceiving me to-day . You deceived me the day you made me believe that you loved me , but you were not strong enough to be sincere . You felt that the burning love of a devoted woman would give you a new spirit ; that is why you betrayed me .<stage>Sinks bending over the table , bursting into tears .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>You accuse yourself with these angry words . Why did you accept this insincerity for so long ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Because I saw it too late . My soul was spirited up into the mountain , so that no disappointment could take me from you . But so it was . Often when you were satiated with pleasure , you failed to show me any regard . What could I do ? Nothing but continue to believe that I would keep your love alive by the strength of my own . I know now , why you did n't dare to meet my look openly . Ingolf , you knew from the beginning , that you might meet a woman you could love more , but meanwhile you took me , intending to turn from me when that time came .<stage>Weeps .</stage>If only I had never known you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>I remember a great many times — you said that you did n't understand how rich life was before you knew me , and that whatever fate would be , you would never regret having given yourself to me . Now I know how sincerely you meant those words .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>You do n't hear how cruel your words are .— I know , Ingolf , I said it . I said it when I could n't control my tongue for gladness . But we never know ourselves until we stand on the edge between joy and sorrow , and now , having touched happiness , I cannot live without grasping it . I cannot , Ingolf , I cannot live without you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Could you get any happiness out of life with a man who does not love you ? HADDA PADDA<stage>silent , gets up , and walks up to the piano , leaning heavily against it</stage>INGOLF<stage>takes out the ring , and puts it on the table</stage>HADDA PADDA<stage>does not stir</stage>Ingolf , this is my last request . Do n't make our separation harder than necessary . I cannot remain in your home when they all know it . Do me the favor of wearing the ring till I leave for home . You wo n't have to wait long .

    <stage>Slope of a valley overgrown with brush and heather and flowers . Toward the rear on the left , a beautiful cataract rushes down from a great height between steep cliffs . On the right , a rock shuts out the bottom of the falls , and part of the river . In the background is a mountainous landscape . It is an exquisite summer evening and the sun is playing on the water in ever changing colours . The stage is empty . From beneath the falls a song is heard , even before the rise of the curtain .</stage>
    <stage>A little before the song ends , Hadda Padda enters from the left , accompanied by the children . She wears a light summer dress with a chiffon scarf thrown over her shoulders . The children have come prepared to gather berries . One has a wooden box , one a coloured glass bottle half filled with berries , etc . They stop to listen until the song is finished .</stage>

     <p>That is a pretty bag you have .</p>

     <p>That 's true . You heal with herbs .... You believe in their power ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HERBORIST</speaker>
     <p>I believe in a fact that cannot be doubted . And I am quite sure that there is no disease that could not be healed by herbs , if people knew enough about their mysteries .</p>

     <p>There are wounds , I suppose , that only death can heal . HERBORIST<stage>looking down into the bag , she takes out an herb</stage>I think the young lady is very depressed , Shall I show her an herb that can heal many ills ?</p>

     <p>Why do you look at me so long ?</p>

     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>You have such a peaceful smile on your face . Are you always so contented ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HERBORIST</speaker>
     <p>I have no reason not to be .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Have you never been discontented with life ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HERBORIST</speaker>
     <p>Yes , when I deserved it . But when one is kind to every one , life brings peace and happiness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Has kindness never taken revenge ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HERBORIST</speaker>
     <p>Kindness does not take revenge . It is only evil that takes revenge .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Then you have been obedient to your fate ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HERBORIST</speaker>
     <p>What I say is true , my girl . Life treats us as we deserve . We cannot get rid of our past . Nature is a righteous judge .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Nature is heartless and blind .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HERBORIST</speaker>
     <p>Nature IS a righteous judge . I shall never forget something that happened thirty years ago . I lived at the sea-shore then . One day , when I was washing fish with some other girls , we saw a woman from the farm take her child by the hand and lead her out to a jutting rock — when the flood tide came it took her . ... HADDA PADDA<stage>looking up</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HERBORIST</speaker>
     <p>The case was brought before the judge . The mother insisted that she had left the child on the ridge , and that it must have walked down to the shore while she was gathering some dulse . Each of us had to point out the spot where she had left the child , but the mother pointed to the ridge . As she raised her three fingers to swear that it was true , a wave rose , and out of it shot a white column of foam . It stretched like an arm into the air — like an arm with three swearing fingers . The sea itself swore against her . HADDA PADDA<stage>A cold shiver runs through her . She draws her scarf more closely around her</stage>It is so strangely cold here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HERBORIST</speaker>
     <p>The sun is going down . I had better be going .<stage>The bag upsets , and some plants slip out .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>The dandelion is slipping out of the bag . Grant the dandelion its life .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HERBORIST</speaker>
     <p>I can n't grant the dandelion its life . Perhaps to-morrow a mother will come with her little girl . “ Rid her of her warts , ” she will say , “ for her hands are so fine . ” ... HADDA PADDA<stage>takes the dandelion in her hands</stage>Grant the dandelion its life . Do you see how it stretches its thousand delicate fingers to the fading light ? If you plant it again , it will close up and be silent a whole night with joy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HERBORIST</speaker>
     <p>You are silent and you do n't smile — is it with joy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>You must not ask me that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HERBORIST</speaker>
     <p>Smile , and I will grant the dandelion its life .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Now I am smiling . HERBORIST<stage>thrusts her hand into the bag</stage>Tell me of your joy , young woman . Each time you give an answer you grant a flower its life .— Of all things ,— what is the softest you have ever felt ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>The hair on my cheek when my lover stroked it . HERBORIST<stage>taking a plant from the bag</stage>Now you have granted the yarrow its life .— Tell me of your joy , young woman . What made your hand so pretty ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Happiness made my hand so pretty . It has smoothed back the hair from the most beautiful forehead . HERBORIST<stage>taking out another plant</stage>Now you have granted the catch-fly its life .— What cast the shade of sorrow in your eyes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Now you are not asking me of joy . Now I will not answer . HERBORIST<stage>shows her a new plant , fondling the flower</stage>Why shall the violet die ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Do not ask me why the violet shall die . ... I want to be alone . HERBORIST<stage>gets up , puts the bag on her shoulder , takes the knife and flowers</stage>God bless thee , young woman ! The Lord be with thee , Hadda Padda .<stage>Disappears to the left .</stage><stage>The sun sets behind the mountains and twilight gradually descends . Hadda Padda sits gazing into space . Suddenly she is startled by voices , and she disappears into the bushes . Native and foreign tourists come from behind the rock , two by two , crossing the stage , conversing . German and French are heard . Behind them all , comes</stage>A YOUNG WOMAN<stage>waiting till the others are gone , she calls</stage>Hadda Padda ! ... Hadda ! ...

     <p>What do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>I thought you wanted to show me the greater consideration . But it is quite the contrary . Sometimes you are positively hard to me , just to spare Hrafnhild every conceivable annoyance .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Do you remember the day after —. When she walked around trying to smile to every one . She was like a sick butterfly . You did n't complain then that I was too considerate to her . KRISTRUN<stage>disregarding his remark</stage>You and she — you wear the rings — you are the lovers in every one 's opinion ! And I have to endure it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>You gave your consent for us to wear the rings till we leave here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>My consent , yes ! If it is a consent that you made me pity her . I do n't think she needs any pity now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Yes , it is very strange ,— to-day , to-day and yesterday she has been tingling with joy . KRISTRUN<stage>sitting down</stage>Now you can see how deeply her love touched her . After ONE week she 's as though nothing had ever happened .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>I leave to-morrow . I 'm going with Helga .— Let us part friends .— I have only one thing to say to you before I go .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>What is that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>You may feel safe now . I wo n't be the shadow in your sunny path . ... I do n't love you any longer , Ingolf .<stage>Ingolf and Kristrun look at her amazed .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Nor do I bear you a grudge ... that is why I can tell you this .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>I always knew you were high-minded , Hrafnhild , but —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>And Runa , dear , wo n't we be the same friendly sisters we have always been ?<stage>Strokes her hair .</stage>Do you want to see that I love you as much as ever ?<stage>Takes her hand .</stage>Come , let me take you in my arms . KRISTRUN<stage>bursting into tears , she throws herself into Hadda 's arms</stage>Hadda , dear — HADDA PADDA<stage>presses Kristrun violently to her breast</stage>KRISTRUN<stage>throwing her head back</stage>Hadda , Hadda , you are hurting me ! HADDA PADDA<stage>lets go of her — turns to Ingolf</stage>And now I would like to speak to you for a moment . May I ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Yes , certainly . HADDA PADDA , Oh , there 's Helga . She is looking for me , Runa , dear , may I say a few words to Ingolf ? You meet Helga , and start for home with her , wo n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KRISTRUN</speaker>
     <p>I 'll do that , Hadda .<stage>Hurries away .</stage>HADDA PADDA<stage>sits down</stage>I think I have discovered that you do n't really enjoy your new happiness . That is why I want to talk to you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>You have told me all I want to hear . HADDA PADDA<stage>involuntarily frowning a moment</stage>It is strange how proud the imagination can be , pretending to be a strong reality . If I had really loved you at all , I would still . I do not . So long as you were free , I made myself believe I had a certain claim to you . But once you were engaged to any one else , the same thing would have happened ?— I should have forgotten you in a week .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>You need not tell me this , I know it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>What do you know ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>I know that you deny your own heart for the sake of others .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Now you think too highly of both of us . I am not so good as you would make me , and it is not so difficult to forget you as you imagine .— You wo n't believe that I have succeeded in forgetting you . Wo n't you believe , either , that I have made every effort to do it ? The day before yesterday I locked myself in my room , and took out your letters to see whether I could bear to read them . I wanted to test myself ,— you know I like to get to the very heart of things . Well , I read letter after letter . It is a remarkable power that is given to a trivial matter . If I had not read the letters , I might still have felt unhappy , but I read and read with ever increasing calmness . I do n't believe my feelings . I go walking , searching for all the places where the earth must be scorched with burning pleasures , in order to know whether they enkindle memories so sacred that they can again inflame me . Everything , everything , is extinguished . What is the matter , little Hadda ? Does everything leave you cold ? Is this death perhaps ? And a mixed feeling of joy and pain seizes me , for this came so unexpected — it came so unexpected — it came so unexpected —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>What is the matter , Hrafnhild ? Are you ill ? You are so excited . Why are you so eager to tell me all this ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Because I do n't want you to think I am making any sacrifice . You think so , but I am not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>I understand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>No , you do n't understand . There was still one place where I was afraid to go , because it meant more to me than any other . I grasped my heart with fear , and there I seemed to find the place . It was the Angelica Gorge ,— where you had put your life in my hands . I was afraid that if I went there , I would instantly lose the peace of mind I had gained . But if I could not bear that , then this peace was nothing but an illusion . I wanted to be sincere with myself — so I went up there last night .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>We saw you walking up the mountain .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>I lay down on the edge of the cliff and looked down into the depth from which I had seen you come up . “ Little heart , ” I said , “ try to be calm while I am tormenting you : Here it was that he raised himself up on the rope I held . Here it was that he showed me how well he loved me . ” But instead of feeling pain , my whole frame quivered with trembling joy . Here , too , I had conquered . Tears of gratitude came into my eyes , I stretched myself farther out on the edge to make my tears of joy fall into the chasm , down to the very bottom .— Do you see now that I am not going to make a sacrifice . Now tell all this to Runa , for she should know it too . INGOLF<stage>very much moved , throws himself at her feet</stage>When you have risen I will kiss the ground your feet have marked .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Then I shall never rise . ... Do n't lie down like that . Get up , Ingolf , INGOLF . I will lie down and forget . Let me dream of death for one moment .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Death ! You who are happy !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Death is not unhappiness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Come , sit down again . I will tell you what death is . Last night I was only a hair 's breadth away from it . INGOLF<stage>starts , terror stricken , he half arises</stage>What are you saying ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>When I lay there on the edge of the gorge , looking down , something dazzlingly white flashed before my eyes . Quite instinctively I reached out for it . It was as if my hands perceived what it was , before my eyes had had time to make it elear to me . It was the string of pearls which bad loosened from my hair . I reached for it without considering how unsafely I was lying there , when suddenly I felt myself slipping down . The sensation cannot be described . While my right hand reached for the pearls which were dropping down into the gorge , my left caught hold of the turf on the brink . I was losing my balance and nothing held me up but a few blades of grass . I felt my heart in my throat , and a cold perspiration over my whole body . Now the grass was giving way , now I clawed my fingers down into the earth and dug my feet into it , but it was too hard ; I tried to press my knees down into the turf — nothing helped , I was slipping . Life or death ! To the right there was a stone . I let go of the grass , and blindly swung my body to the right , my feet slipped beyond the edge ,— but my hands had caught hold of the stone . When I got to the edge again , I lay in a stupour for a long time , and I did not know whether I was at the bottom of the gorge or at the top .— Never have I loved life as I do to-day .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>How horrible ! But what made you wear the pearls ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>It was foolish , but I do n't know whether you can blame me . One day , when I was almost melancholy , and I could not talk to anybody , I was seized with an unconquerable home-sick feeling . I yearned for mother , and felt how much I loved her . I took the pearls out and looked at this precious heirloom , which she had given me . I fastened it in my hair ,— and immediately I felt better . That was why I wore them the nest day too .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>And now they lie at the bottom of the gorge !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>What are you going to tell your mother ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>I wo n't tell her anything before I know whether they will be found .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Have you asked any one to search for them ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>I just thought of asking Steindor , but I can hardly bring myself to tell him ,— if afterwards they should not be found . INGOLF<stage>A vague disquietude takes possession of him . He is silent for an instant , then stares at Hadda , trying to read the influence of his words upon her</stage>Well , you are going to-morrow , and the very next day I will go down into the gorge and look for them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Will you really , Ingolf ? And not tell Runa that I lost them ? Mother must not know that I have treated the pearls so carelessly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>I wo n't tell any one . HADDA PADDA<stage>looking at him with wide-opened eyes</stage>I 'd like it even more if you would do it before I left . If you looked for them to-morrow morning while I am getting ready to go . Then you 'd spare me the anxiety . Take Steindor with you , will you ? INGOLF<stage>gets up . All doubt leaves his mind as he looks into her face and he is ashamed of the unworthy suspicion that had touched his soul</stage>Yes , Hrafnhild , do n't be distressed . We shall find your pearls .— Are n't you coming with me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA . PADDA</speaker>
     <p>No , I will wait for the children .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Good-night , Hrafnhild .<stage>Goes .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Good-night .<stage>Looks after him for a long time . Her eyes fill with tears , and she throws herself down weeping violently . Soon the voices of children , laughing , are heard near by . She looks up , passes her hand over her eyes , hears the children 's footsteps and lies down again as if asleep .</stage>THE CHILDREN<stage>enter . In addition to the berries , each of them carries a bouquet of flowers</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LITTLE SKULI</speaker>
     <p>She 's asleep .<stage>He takes his bouquet , and those of the others , placing them around her head .</stage>The children sit down quietly , eating their berries .</p>

    <stage>CURTAIN</stage>
   </div>
   <div type="act" n="4">
    <head type="act">ACT IV</head>
    <stage>A deep gorge viewed from the side , its walls running obliquely down from right to left . The upper end of the outer edge merges into the mountain slope , which shuts out the view to the left . It is foggy . On the left , as the fog lifts , a waterfall glistens in the distance , like a broad white streak in the air . The sides of the gorge are abruptly terminated by a cliff , the top of which is grass-grown . Here , Ingolf and Steindor are sitting . Beside them is a long rope .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>Just look how it is drizzling ! ... I can write on my clothes .<stage>Forms letters on his sleeve .</stage>INGOLF<stage>strokes his finger along his sleeve</stage>My suit just matches the drizzle . STEINDOR<stage>is silent</stage>INGOLF<stage>is aroused , as from a reverie</stage>Are you rested ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>Oh , very nearly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>You should have let me pull you up . It is too tiring to raise oneself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>I have been lowering myself into this gorge for fourteen years now , to get angelica , and always without help . This is no height at all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>How high do you think it is ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>Only half a rope-length .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>How long is a rope-length ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>A hundred and twenty feet .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Have you lowered yourself that far ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>I guess even a little more . One summer on the Westmen Isles , I went down three rope-lengths , for fowl ; but then , I tied the rope around my waist , and took a stick along , to push myself off from the rock , so that the rope would n't turn .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>The rope turned round with me before .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>Only practice can prevent it . INGOLF<stage>gets up , walks out to the brink , and looks down into the gorge</stage>Did you look everywhere possible ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>I did .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>So did I . But it is very dark in some places , and there are so many holes . Did you look in the holes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>Well , I was n't going to crawl into every pit — that would be an endless job . Besides , I think it serves these women right , once in a while , to have themselves to blame . It teaches them to take better care next time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Do n't speak to any one about it . She asked me not to tell anybody . I would n't have told you , if I 'd had any luck in my search . But I thought perhaps you might be able to find them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>You told the family that you had lost your diamond ring .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Yes , then we will say we have found it .<stage>Looks down into the gorge .</stage>How uncanny it looks down there ! It is as if the fog were shunning the gully , so inky black ! ... See how sombre the ravine looks ! STEINDOR<stage>gets up , and walks out on the brink</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>It looks uncanny down there !<stage>Warning him .</stage>Do n't go too near the edge . STEINDOR<stage>laughing</stage>Steindor can take care of himself !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Have you ever fallen , Steindor ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>Oh , well , I 've had my share of that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>How did it affect you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>I do n't wish myself a better death , if the fall is high enough . One winter I was going over a gully , clogged with a frozen snow-pile . I had to pass it ; so I forced my stick down into the pile , and leaped over it . I tried to pull it out as I came over , but it stuck tight , and threw me backwards . I knew nothing more , until I woke up at the foot of the rocks , and saw the blood stains on the snow . I had scratched myself on the edge as I grazed over it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>And otherwise you got off alright ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>Quite alright . I landed on the soft snow . Had it been rocky below , I would have died instantly . Since that day , I say falling from a height is n't the worst death . You lose all consciousness in falling .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>To fall from here would be horrible .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>It 's more horrible thinking about it than anything else .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>It would be quite a fall .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>Oh , yes — I think you would get your fill .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Here , take the rope , Steindor . Let us go . STEINDOR<stage>looking around</stage>Some one is coming up along the ravine .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Where ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>There — why , it 's Hrafnhild . She is nearly here now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>What is she carrying over her shoulder ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>It looks like a spade .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Come , let 's go and meet her .</l>
      <stage>They take a few steps .</stage>
      <l>HANNA PADDA</l>
      <stage>is heard calling</stage>
      <l>Wait !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>What do you think she wants with a spade ? HADDA PADDA<stage>is heard calling , almost out of breath</stage>I wanted to catch you before you went down .<stage>Enters .</stage>There was nobody else at home to bring the spade , so I offered to do it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Did you tell mother we were coming here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>She asked . She saw you walk up the mountain . I told her you had lost your diamond ring in the gorge , and you and Steindor were going down to look for it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Did she send you with the spade ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>No , she said , that if she had known it , she would have asked you to take a spade along , and get some angelicas for the garden . That is why I followed you .<stage>Walks out and drives the spade in the ground .</stage>Have you been down already ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Yes , we have .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Did you find your diamond ring ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>We did not find your pearls .— Yes , I had to tell Steindor . I went down first and searched very carefully ; then I asked Steindor to go down ,— I thought he might have better luck .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>They will never be found .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>They MUST be found ; they SHALL be found . INGOLF<stage>looks questioningly into her eyes</stage>Are you sure they did not fall beyond that lowest rock ?<stage>Points in the direction .</stage>HADDA PADDA<stage>eagerly , and returning his glance calmly</stage>No , no . I saw them fall , just by the big stone . You have n't looked carefully enough . It has really taken you no time at all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>I hunted for them everywhere , as if I were searching for a needle .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>I can n't search any better than I have ,</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Then it is due to the fog . Probably I have to wait till later ... No , I can n't go home without them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>The fog is not so dense , that they could n't be found on its account . You can see all around , down in the gorge . Just look ! HADDA PADDA<stage>walks out to the edge , looks down , turns round abruptly</stage>Did you search in the pool near the big stone ? It might have fallen there .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>I took a look at it , but I did n't see anything .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>I would have seen them glitter in the water , if they were there .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Glitter in the water ! And the pool covered with duck - weed ! So that 's how you searched !— Did you look all through the duck-weed , did you fish it out of the pond , to see if the pearls were hidden in it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>No , I did n't do that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>No , it may be possible —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Yes , it is possible , to be sure . Hundreds of women might have lost their pearls down there , without your having found them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>No , I think you are the only one ... HADDA PADDA<stage>turns quickly toward Ingolf</stage>What do you think mother will say when she hears that I have lost the heirloom ?—<stage>Resolutely .</stage>Men never can find anything , men do not understand how to search .<stage>Tears the rope from Steindor .</stage>I had better go down myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>You do n't really intend to go down ? HADDA PADDA<stage>ties one end around her waist</stage>I intend to do what I can to find my lost treasure again . STEINDOR . You will not go far , I think , before you ask us to pull you up .</p>

     <p>I have been lowered into this gorge before . INGOLF<stage>takes the loose end</stage>I forbid you to go down , Hrafnhild .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>You forbid me ? ... I forbid you to touch this rope . Or , shall we see who is stronger ?<stage>pulls the rope .</stage>INGOLF<stage>coming nearer to her , he lets the rope slip</stage>I know what you are thinking , Hrafnhild . You want us to go down again , and you know this is the only way you can get us to do it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Do you think I am afraid to go down ? It would only give me joy . And if you did n't find the pearls , when you looked for them the second time , I would go down , anyhow . I would never be at rest until I had searched myself .<stage>Ingolf lets go of the rope , takes Steindor aside — he nods . They both look at Hrafnhild while she fastens the rope around her waist more securely .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>What are you going to do now ? HADDA PADDA<stage>having finished tying the knot , holds the rope out to them</stage>Will you hold the rope while I go down ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>No , I wo n't .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>I wo n't either . HADDA PADDA<stage>bites her lips , stares at the men</stage>Go on home !<stage>Starts to wind up the rope .</stage>I do n't need you . You think I can n't do without you ? You think the mountain has n't stones heavy enough to keep me up ?<stage>Runs away , and disappears toward the mountain .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>I do n't remember exactly — it 's quite impossible to enter the gorge from below , is n't it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>So far , only the birds have that privilege . It 's a headlong precipice on three sides !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>I wo n't let Hrafnhild go down .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>She says she has gone down in the gorge before . Is that true ? INGOLF<stage>nods reluctantly</stage>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>When was that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Last summer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>Did you hold the rope ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>I did .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>Well , then I do n't know what you are afraid of .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>It seems strange that Hrafnhild should come up here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>She came with the spade .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>It seems strange we did n't find the pearls , if they were in the gorge .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>She 'll be lucky if they are ever found .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>It seems strange that she dropped them . When I saw that she herself was coming here , it flashed across my mind , that she had n't dropped the pearls in the gorge after all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>I do n't understand — what are you driving at ? Do you think it is something she invented ? Why should she ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>I am afraid to let her go down . HADDA PADDA<stage>enters with a large stone in her arms which she places on the edge . She has the coil of rope thrown over her shoulder . Laughs</stage>So you have n't gone yet !<stage>Takes the spade and starts to dig .</stage>Do n't you think I can do without you now ? I will dig a deep , deep hole . Then I 'll tie one end of the rope around the stone , and place it into the hole .— Then I 'll go and get more stones up in the mountain and pile them up . You will see how well it will hold . INGOLF<stage>examining the stone</stage>So you think it will hold ? Well —<stage>Takes the stone and flings it into the ravine .</stage>HADDA PADDA<stage>smiling , she looks at Ingolf</stage>I shall take better care next time .<stage>Running away , Ingolf and Steindor look after her .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>She is determined to go down .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>I will offer to go down again . Let us both offer to go down .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>She said she would go down anyhow , if we did n't find the pearls .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Just look how fast she is running ! She is holding her hand to her breast .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>Now she is stopping ... She is lifting a stone ... Now she has thrown it away .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>She runs without stopping .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>Now she has found a new stone .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>She is bending over it . What is she doing ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>She is tying the rope around it . She wo n't let you hurl this one over ,</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>She is lifting the stone , and carrying it in her arms .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>She is strong , Hrafnhild is . Now she is running with it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>See how the earth is slipping from under her feet . See how the pebbles pursue her ! She is running away from them with the big stone . She is holding it in her arms as if it were a child she were rescuing . HADDA PADDA<stage>enters , carrying the stone which she cautiously places on the edge . Smiles</stage>You have n't gone yet ! What are you waiting for ?<stage>Takes the spade , and starts to deepen the hole .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Steindor and I will go down for you . We will search as thoroughly as possible .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>You are kind . But now I will let nothing prevent me from going down . Had you offered to do so before , I would have accepted ; but when you say you forbid me to go down , I intend to go .<stage>Steindor walks restlessly near the edge .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>You know that we can prevent you from going down .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>You can — how ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>We can take the rope from you and go home .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Yes — you can do that .<stage>Turns away .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>What would you do then ? HADDA PADDA<stage>in same position</stage>Go home and get another rope .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Do n't be so obstinate , Hrafnhild . HADDA PADDA<stage>in a low voice</stage>Why do n't you call me by my pretty name any more ? We are n't enemies . Promise to call me Hadda Padda always . When I leave to-day , when I mount my horse , and ride away , wave your hat to me and call : Good-bye , Hadda Padda .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Are you determined to go to-day ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Determined .<stage>Rolls the stone into the hole , takes it up again , and digs deeper .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>You wo n't accept our offer ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>No , I wo n't .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Then stop your digging . It is useless . HADDA PADDA<stage>looks at him , puzzled</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>You must understand that we will not stand by , and let you go down with only a loose stone to hold you up .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>True , I would n't be as nervous , if I knew you were holding the rope .<stage>Puts the spade aside , and looks down into the gorge .</stage>INGOLF<stage>unties the rope from the stone</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know whether I dare go down , Ingolf .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Do n't go — give it up .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>I never saw the gorge so hushed . How it stretches its cold , greedy stone-fingers into the air !— But imagine my finding the pearls !<stage>Determined .</stage>I must go down . Is the rope safe ? STEINDOR<stage>standing near them</stage>Even if there were three Hadda Paddas —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Ingolf ! I am not afraid to be lowered down by your hands .<stage>Lies down with her feet over the edge .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>There are others beside Ingolf , to be sure , who could hold up one woman .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>I hate to see you go down . HADDA PADDA<stage>is silent for an instant , turns abruptly around , looks down the gorge , gets up and takes the spade</stage>You are n't sitting safely , Ingolf . I will deepen the hole , so that you can have something to push your feet against .<stage>Digs .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p><stage>with an amused smile</stage>You believe you are heavier than you are , Hadda Padda .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>I ask you once again , to give up the idea .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Are you afraid you will lose me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>You can spare your scoffing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>I am not scoffing . I 'm the one who is afraid . You are not so strong as you pretend . Steindor , will you hold the rope with him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>You do n't have to sneer at me .<stage>At his glance , Steindor turns away .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Now set your feet securely , Ingolf , and both of you hold the rope . Do that for me , and I 'll go down quite fearlessly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Well , we will both hold the rope .<stage>Steindor sits down , catching the rope too .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Now I am safe .<stage>Disappears below the edge . The rope is seen sliding slowly and firmly through their hands .</stage>INGOLF<stage>pushing Steindor away</stage>Get up ! I wo n't accept an affront like this — not to let me hold the rope alone ! Get up and keep an eye on her ,— but do n't let her see you .<stage>Steindor gets up . The rope slides down for a time .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE VOICE OF HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Ingolf !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Well ?<stage>Stops the rope .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE VOICE OF HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Are you both holding the rope ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE VOICE OF HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Tell me the truth , Ingolf .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>We are both holding the rope .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE VOICE OF HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Tell me the truth . Is Steindor holding the rope ? INGOLF<stage>to Steindor</stage>You have let her see you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>No , no !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE VOICE OF HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Why did you deceive me , Ingolf ! Pull me up !<stage>Ingolf pulls up the rope .</stage>HADDA PADDA<stage>reappears over the edge</stage>Why did you deceive me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>I felt ashamed to hold the rope with some one else .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>The idea flashed upon me . That is why I called . I knew your pride . But suddenly I grew nervous . I seemed so far from all human life . Since you do n't want Steindor to hold the rope , he must stand some place where I can always see him . Steindor , stand where I can see you . Now and then you 'll call to me . You 'll just call : Hadda Padda ! and I will answer : Yes . Then we will get word from each other . Here , on the edge , you can see me —<stage>points to the farther edge</stage>— down there on the ledge , I can see you perfectly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Yes , do that , Steindor .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>Alright .<stage>Goes there .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Why do n't you place your feet in the hole , so that you will sit more securely ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Are you afraid I 'm sitting too near the edge ? HADDA PADDA<stage>takes the end of the rope</stage>There is no knot on the end . Fancy , if the rope slipped out of your hands .<stage>Ties a knot in it .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Why are you so frightened ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know .... It was n't fair to prevent Steindor from holding the rope with you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>If you are so afraid , of course we will both hold the rope .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know .... Oh — no , hold it alone . I also want to see some one , to see him stand there , and hear him call to me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>I prefer that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>But now if it should slip from you —! If you open your hand a hair 's breadth too much , you will lose the rope !<stage>She starts with a shudder .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>I shall let the rope slide over my shoulder — will you be more at ease then ? Act IV</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>If you tie it around your waist , so that it will be impossible for you to let go of me — then I will be at ease . INGOLF<stage>gazes intently at her , as if to penetrate the mysterious veil which envelopes her manner , her words , and her actions . Suddenly he grasps the end of the rope and ties it around his waist</stage>HADDA PADDA<stage>sits down on the edge</stage>I nearly forgot the spade . I will dig up an angelica , and take it along with me .<stage>Disappears below the edge . The rope slides for a time .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>You can see her , Steindor ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>She is like an expert rope-climber . She is keeping herself from the rock with the spade .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Do n't lose sight of her . Tell me how she is getting along .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>I am not anxious about her going down . Now she is about passing the ledge . There , now you can let the rope slide quicker .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>It is strange how the rope slides out of my hands . It is as if a living worm were boring out through them . STEINDOR<stage>calls</stage>Hadda Padda !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE VOICE OF HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>She is flying down ... Now the rope is turning ... It is strange to see some one else lowered down .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Is it still turning ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>Now it is turning to the other side .— Hadda Padda ! THE VOICE OF HADDA PADDA<stage>just audible</stage>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>Lower her faster , it amuses her . She waved her hand to me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>She waved her hand to you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>Oh , she lost the spade .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>She lost the spade ! Did n't she throw it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>I think she lost it . Act IV</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>What is she doing now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>I can n't see .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Is she doing anything ?— It is n't possible . Has she a long way left ?<stage>Gives the rope as quickly as possible .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>No .— Hadda Padda !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Now I do n't hear her answer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>Nor I .<stage>Calls louder .</stage>Hadda Padda !<stage>Listens .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Do you hear her answer ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>No ... Yes , yes , now she has heard — she is waving — she is waving with both hands .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Good — she is alright then .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>Now I think she is down !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>The rope does not slacken —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>I do n't see her moving any more . INGOLF<stage>as the rope slackens</stage>Well , now she is down ! Do you see her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>She just picked up the spade . Now she is going with it way under the rock . INGOLF<stage>He holds the rope so loosely , that it runs freely through his fingers</stage>She evidently intends to dig up some angelica before searching .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>The rope is dragging along with her , she has not untied it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Do you see her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Let us wait calmly .<stage>Rests his chin in his palm .</stage></p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>I can n't understand what is keeping her so long .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>You could n't expect her any sooner .<stage>Peers down .</stage>She has just come from under the rock . She has an angelica with her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>She is jerking the rope — she jerked three times .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>She tied the spade and angelica to the rope . Pull it up !<stage>INGOLF pulls the rope up quickly .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>Now she is going to look for the pearls . INGOLF<stage>The fear and anxiety seen on his face all this time give place to a more cheerful expression</stage>Now we can be at ease . Who knows , maybe she will find the pearls !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>She is searching in the pool . She is pulling out the duck-weed . INGOLF<stage>draws the spade and angelica up over the edge , loosens the rope , coils it up , and throws it down again</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>She is walking around the pool . Now she has turned her back to me . I can n't see — I think she is looking around ... she is bending over the pool .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Now I am at ease —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>Now she jumped up ! She is raising her arms — she is waving the pearls at me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Bravo , bravo !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>It was just a piece of luck !— Now she is tying the rope around herself .—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>She just pulled ,— now I 'll be quick about it .<stage>Starts pulling .</stage>STEINDOR<stage>after a while</stage>It looks as if she were sleeping on the rope .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>What ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>Her body is relaxed ... Should I call to her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>No , do n't disturb her . I know the pleasure of cleaving the air with closed eyes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>Now she starts ... now she seems to be at rest again . She is crouching like one who is cold in bed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Tell me when we reach the ledge .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>There is n't much left now . Are n't you tired pulling ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Not very . STEINDOR<stage>smiling</stage>You will show your sweetheart how strong you are .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Are n't we at the ledge yet ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>Not quite . INGOLF<stage>pulling on</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>She looks strange now . She is grasping the rope firmly — she is cringing . She looks like a spider winding her way up ,</p>

     <p>Well !</p>

     <speaker>THE VOICE OP HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>I will rest on the ledge . INGOLF<stage>continues pulling</stage>You will be up soon !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE VOICE OF HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>No , no , Ingolf ! The rope is too tight .— You must not pull like that .— The rope hurts me so under my breast .<stage>The rope relaxed ; Ingolf stops pulling .</stage>STEINDOR<stage>motions to him</stage>You must hold the rope tight , so that she can raise herself up to the ledge .— Well , now she is there !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>What is she doing ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>She is sitting down ... she is adjusting the rope around her waist ... or , what ... yes , she has untied it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE VOICE OP HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>You need not stay here any longer ,</l>
      <l>Steindor . I am not afraid any more .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>I am very comfortable here . THE VOICE OF HADDA PADDA<stage>She is heard laughing</stage>Shall I stone the raven away from his nest ? Beware , you blackbird !<stage>A small stone flies through the air , and falls down near Steindor . He starts .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE VOICE OF HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Were you afraid of the stone ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>I think it an unnecessary joke !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE VOICE OF HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>Ha ! Ha ! Did you think I would stone you ? It is fun to scare you ! Shall I try to hit you with the rope ?— Ingolf , let the rope go , please . I will try to hit Steindor with it — he is deathly afraid . STEINDOR<stage>who now wants to show that he understands the joke</stage>I wager you wo n't reach me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>I bet she hits you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE VOICE OF HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>I would have hit before , if the rope had n't been too short .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>No , you never would have done it — you have to aim better than that !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE VOICE OF HADDA PADDA</speaker>
     <p>The rope was too short .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>It 's easy to lengthen it . Ingolf ! Give her full rope . Let us see if she can hit me ! INGOLF<stage>laughing</stage>You must take care , Steindor !<stage>He holds the rope loosely in his hands . Gradually it is pulled down entirely , till it is in a straight line with Ingolf 's waist . Soon after the rope-end is seen hitting against the edge , touching Steindor 's foot .</stage>THE VOICE OF HADDA PADDA . Did n't it hit ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>Well , we can call it that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>You have to be careful , next time , Steindor !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>What ! Wo n't you try any more ? Are you tying the rope around you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Is she rested ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>She is tying the rope around her and is lowering herself down under the ledge . INGOLF<stage>looks at him in astonishment</stage>What are you saying ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>But why has she made the rope so taut ?<stage>He is amazed .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>What is the matter ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>Hadda Padda is standing on her head in the air . INGOLF ...?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>She is bracing her feet against the rock . Look out !<stage>Ingolf braces his feet against the sides of the hole . Steindor gets up .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Stay where you are , and tell me — I 'll raise her up in a moment ,<stage>He pulls the rope with all his strength . A moment later he is dragged prostrate , out to the edge .</stage>STEINDOR<stage>runs to him , catching hold of him</stage>Great God ! Is she insane ? I would n't have suspected this . INGOLF<stage>in a low voice</stage>Where does she get that strength from ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The rope is pulled still more violently than before ; they are both dragged forward . Ingolf rolls on his back , using all his power to draw up the rope .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Loosen the rope , quick ! Ill try to hold on .<stage>Steindor hurries to loosen the rope . While he is doing it , Ingolf struggles to hold fast . Now he is holding his arms high up in the air , rope in hand ; now his arms are pulled down . Each time Steindor thinks he is on the verge of giving up , he lets go of the rope , and catches hold of Ingolf .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>Now it is free !<stage>Supports Ingolf . The rope is once more pulled so violently , that it is drawn through Ingolf 's hands right up to the knot . He holds on to the rope beyond the knot as for life , while they are both dragged further forward .</stage>STEINDOR<stage>frightened</stage>You must let go of the rope . That 's all you can do . It is better that she falls alone , than that she drag both of us with her . You must let go . Or I 'll let go . INGOLF<stage>looking directly at him</stage>Let go , then , you coward !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>Why did you want me to untie the rope , if you intend to make her drag you down ? INGOLF<stage>with icy calmness</stage>Have you courage to hold me while I try to get up ?<stage>Gets up .</stage>STEINDOR<stage>still supporting him</stage>She is probably exhausted , now . INGOLF<stage>starts to pull the rope up . He is bare-headed , his hat is lying on the edge ; his hair is wet with perspiration , which trickles down on his face . The very shape of his head seems strangely altered .</stage>Leave me , Steindor , I am through with you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>I wo n't stand here idle , and see you dragged into the chasm .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INGOLF</speaker>
     <p>Get out of my sight , do you hear ? Or you 'll see what 's in store for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEINDOR</speaker>
     <p>She 's mad , I tell you — she 's mad .<stage>Takes a few steps and stops .</stage>Ingolf pulls the rope up , quickly , and firmly , with caution in each grasp . Hadda Padda 's white and beautiful hand appears above the edge of the gorge , holding a large , shining knife , which cuts the rope . HADDA PADDA<stage>in falling</stage>Ingolf ! INGOLF<stage>is thrown back as the resistance is cut off ; he jumps up ; rushes to the edge , crying with horror</stage>Hadda Padda ! He gazes down into the gorge for a moment ; his knees give way under him ; he stretches up his arms , uttering a terrible cry of horror . Steindor approaches . Ingolf looks down into the gorge . Listlessly , he lifts the hand which holds the fragment of rope . His eyes are dim with tears which do not fall . Through the moisture of the tears , he looks at the newly cut wound in the rope .</p>
