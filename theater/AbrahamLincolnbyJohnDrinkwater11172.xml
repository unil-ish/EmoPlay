    <docDate><date>1919</date>To THE LORD CHARNWOOD NOTE In using for purposes of drama a personality of so wide and recent a fame as that of Abraham Lincoln , I feel that one or two observations are due to my readers and critics . First , my purpose is that not of the historian but of the dramatist . The historical presentation of my hero has been faithfully made in many volumes ; notably , in England , by Lord Charnwood in a monograph that gives a masterly analysis of Lincoln 's career and character and is , it seems to me , a model of what the historian 's work should be . To this book I am gratefully indebted for the material of my play . But while I have , I hope , done nothing to traverse history , I have freely telescoped its events , and imposed invention upon its movement , in such ways as I needed to shape the dramatic significance of my subject . I should add that the fictitious Burnet Hook is admitted to the historical company of Lincoln 's Cabinet for the purpose of embodying certain forces that were antagonistic to the President . This was a dramatic necessity , and I chose rather to invent a character for the purpose than to invest any single known personage with sinister qualities about which there might be dispute . Secondly , my purpose is , again , that of the dramatist , not that of the political philosopher . The issue of secession was a very intricate one , upon which high and generous opinions may be in conflict , but that I may happen to have or lack personal sympathy with Lincoln 's policy and judgment in this matter is nothing . My concern is with the profoundly dramatic interest of his character , and with the inspiring example of a man who handled war nobly and with imagination . Finally , I am an Englishman , and not a citizen of the great country that gave Lincoln birth . I have , therefore , written as an Englishman , making no attempt to achieve a “ local colour ” of which I have no experience , or to speak in an idiom to which I have not been bred . To have done otherwise , as I am sure any American friends that this play may have the good fortune to make will allow , would have been to treat a great subject with levity .</docDate>
    <docImprint>J. D . Far Oakridge , July-August ,<date>1918</date>INTRODUCTORY NOTE This play was originally produced by the Birmingham Repertory Theatre last year , and it had a great success in Birmingham . But if its author had not happened to be the artistic director of the Birmingham Repertory Theatre the play might never have been produced there . The rumour of the provincial success reached<settlement>London</settlement>, with the usual result — that<settlement>London</settlement>managers magnificently ignored it . I have myself spoken with a very well-known<settlement>London</settlement>actor-manager who admitted to me that he had refused the play .</docImprint>

   <performance>When Nigel Playfair , in conjunction with myself as a sort of Chancellor of the Exchequer , started the Hammersmith Playhouse ( for the presentation of the best plays that could be got ) we at once began to inquire into the case of Abraham Lincoln . Nigel Playfair was absolutely determined to have the play and the Birmingham company to act it . I read the play and greatly admired it . We secured both the play and the company . The first Hammersmith performance was a tremendous success , both for the author of the play and for William J. Rea , the Irish actor who in the rôle of Lincoln was merely great . The audience cried .</performance>
   <titlePage>
    <docTitle><titlePart>I should have cried myself , but for my iron resolve not to stain a well-earned reputation for callousness . As I returned home that night from what are known as “ the wilds of Hammersmith ” ( Hammersmith is a suburb of London ) I said to myself : “ This play is bound to succeed ” The next moment I said to myself : “ This play cannot possibly succeed . It has no love interest . It is a political play . Its theme is the threatened separation of the Southern States from the Northern States . Nobody ever heard of a play with such an absurd theme reaching permanent success . No author before John Drinkwater ever had the effrontery to impose such a theme on a London public . ” My instinct was right and my reason was wrong . The play did succeed . It is still succeeding , and it will continue to succeed . Nobody can dine out in London to-day and admit without a blush that he has not seen ABRAHAM LINCOLN . Monarchs and princes have seen it . Archbishops have seen it . Statesmen without number have seen it . An ex-Lord Chancellor told me that he had journeyed out into the said wilds and was informed at the theatre that there were no seats left . He could not believe that he would have to return from the wilds unsatisfied . But so it fell out . West End managers have tried to coax the play from Hammersmith to the West End . They could not do it . We have contrived to make all London come to Hammersmith to see a play without a love-interest or a bedroom scene , and the play will remain at Hammersmith . Americans will more clearly realize what John Drinkwater has achieved with the London public if they imagine somebody putting on a play about the Crimean War at some unknown derelict theatre round about Two Hundred and Fiftieth Street , and drawing all New York to Two Hundred and Fiftieth Street . ABRAHAM LINCOLN has pleased everybody , and its triumph is the best justification of those few who held that the public was capable of liking much better plays than were offered to the public . Why has ABRAHAM LINCOLN succeeded ? Here are a few answers to the question : Because the author had a deep , practical knowledge of the stage . Because he disdained all stage tricks . Because he had the wit to select for his hero one of the world 's greatest and finest characters . Because he had the audacity to select a gigantic theme and to handle it with simplicity . Because he had the courage of all his artistic and moral convictions . And of course because he has a genuine dramatic gift . Finally , because William J. Rea plays Lincoln with the utmost nobility of emotional power . Every audience has the same experience at ABRAHAM LINCOLN , and I laugh privately when I think of that experience . The curtain goes up on a highly commonplace little parlour , and a few ordinary people chatting in a highly commonplace manner . They keep on chatting . The audience thinks to itself : “ I 've been done ! What is this interminable small talk ? ” And it wants to call out a protest : “ Hi ! You fellows on the stage ! Have you forgotten that there is an audience on the other side of the footlights , waiting for something to happen ? ” ( Truly the ordinary people in the parlour do seem to be unaware of the existence of any audience . ) But wait , audience ! Already the author is winding his chains about you . Though you may not suspect it , you are already bound .... At the end of the first scene the audience , vaguely feeling the spell , wonders what on earth the nature of the spell is . At the end of the play it is perhaps still wondering what precisely the nature of the spell is .... But it fully and rapturously admits the reality of the spell . Indeed after the fall of the curtain , and after many falls of the curtain , the spell persists ; the audience somehow cannot leave its seats , and the thought of the worry of the journey home and of last ‘ busses and trains is banished . Strange phenomenon ! It occurs every night .</titlePart></docTitle>

   <stage>Two Chroniclers :</stage>
   <stage>The two speaking together : Kinsmen , you shall behold Our stage , in mimic action , mould A man 's character .</stage>
   <stage>This is the wonder , always , everywhere — Not that vast mutability which is event , The pits and pinnacles of change , But man 's desire and valiance that range All circumstance , and come to port unspent .</stage>
   <stage>Agents are these events , these ecstasies , And tribulations , to prove the purities Or poor oblivions that are our being . When Beauty and peace possess us , they are none But as they touch the beauty and peace of men , Nor , when our days are done , And the last utterance of doom must fall , Is the doom anything Memorable for its apparelling ; The bearing of man facing it is all .</stage>
   <stage>So , kinsmen , we present This for no loud event That is but fugitive , But that you may behold Our mimic action mould The spirit of man immortally to live .</stage>
   <stage>First Chronicler : Once when a peril touched the days Of freedom in our English ways , And none renowned in government Was equal found , Came to the steadfast heart of one , Who watched in lonely Huntingdon , A summons , and he went , And tyranny was bound , And Cromwell was the lord of his event .</stage>
   <stage>Second Chronicler : And in that land where voyaging The pilgrim Mayflower came to rest , Among the chosen , counselling , Once , when bewilderment possessed A people , none there was might draw To fold the wandering thoughts of men , And make as one the names again Of liberty and law .</stage>
   <stage>And then , from fifty fameless years In quiet Illinois was sent A word that still the Atlantic hears , And Lincoln was the lord of his event .</stage>
   <stage>The two speaking together : So the uncounted spirit wakes To the birth Of uncounted circumstance . And time in a generation makes Portents majestic a little story of earth To be remembered by chance At a fireside . But the ardours that they bear , The proud and invincible motions of character —</stage>
   <stage>These — these abide .</stage>

     <stage>The parlour of Abraham Lincoln 's House at Springfield , Illinois , early in 1860 . MR. STONE , a farmer , and MR. CUFFNEY , a store-keeper , both men of between fifty and sixty , are sitting before an early spring fire . It is dusk , but the curtains are not drawn . The men are smoking silently .</stage>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Stone</speaker>
     <p><stage>after a pause</stage>Abraham . It 's a good name for a man to bear , anyway .</p>

     <p>Yes . That 's right .</p>

     <speaker>Mr. Stone</speaker>
     <p><stage>after another pause</stage>Abraham Lincoln . I 've known him forty years . Never crooked once . Well . He taps his pipe reflectively on the grate . There is another pause . SUSAN , a servant-maid , comes in , and busies herself lighting candles and drawing the curtains to .</p>

     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>Mrs. Lincoln has just come in . She says she 'll be here directly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Cuffney</speaker>
     <p>Thank you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Stone</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Lincoln is n't home yet , I dare say ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>No , Mr. Stone . He wo n't be long , with all the gentlemen coming .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Stone</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>: How would you like your master to be President of the</l>
      <l>United States , Susan ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sure he 'd do it very nicely , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Cuffney</speaker>
     <p>He would have to leave Springfield , Susan , and go to live in Washington .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>I dare say we should take to Washington very well , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Cuffney</speaker>
     <p>Ah ! I 'm glad to hear that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>Mrs. Lincoln 's rather particular about the tobacco smoke .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Stone</speaker>
     <p>To be sure , yes , thank you , Susan .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>The master does n't smoke , you know . And Mrs. Lincoln 's specially particular about this room .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Cuffney</speaker>
     <p>Quite so . That 's very considerate of you , Susan . They knock out their pipes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>Though some people might not hold with a gentleman not doing as he 'd a mind in his own house , as you might say . She goes out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Cuffney</speaker>
     <p><stage>after a further pause , stroking his pipe</stage>I suppose there 's no doubt about the message they 'll bring ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Stone</speaker>
     <p>No , that 's settled right enough . It 'll be an invitation . That 's as sure as John Brown 's dead .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Cuffney</speaker>
     <p>I could never make Abraham out rightly about old John . One could n't stomach slaving more than the other , yet Abraham did n't hold with the old chap standing up against it with the sword . Bad philosophy , or something , he called it . Talked about fanatics who do nothing but get themselves at a rope 's end .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Stone</speaker>
     <p>Abraham 's all for the Constitution . He wants the Constitution to be an honest master . There 's nothing he wants like that , and he 'll stand for that , firm as a Samson of the spirit , if he goes to Washington . He 'd give his life to persuade the state against slaving , but until it is persuaded and makes its laws against it , he 'll have nothing to do with violence in the name of laws that are n't made . That 's why old John 's raiding affair stuck in his gullet .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Cuffney</speaker>
     <p>He was a brave man , going like that , with a few zealous like himself , and a handful of niggers , to free thousands .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Stone</speaker>
     <p>He was . And those were brave words when they took him out to hang him . “ I think , my friends , you are guilty of a great wrong against God and humanity . You may dispose of me very easily . I am nearly disposed of now . But this question is still to be settled — this negro question , I mean . The end of that is not yet . ” I was there that day . Stonewall Jackson was there . He turned away . There was a colonel there giving orders . When it was over , “ So perish all foes of the human race , ” he called out . But only those that were afraid of losing their slaves believed it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Cuffney</speaker>
     <p><stage>after a pause</stage>It was a bad thing to hang a man like that . ... There 's a song that they 've made about him . He sings quietly . John Brown 's body lies a mould'ring in the grave , But his soul goes marching on ...</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Stone</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>: I know .</l>
      <l>The two together</l>
      <stage>singing quietly</stage>
      <l>:</l>
      <l>The stars of heaven are looking kindly down</l>
      <l>On the grave of old John Brown ....</l>
      <l>After a moment MRS. LINCOLN comes in . The men rise .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Good-evening , Mr. Stone . Good-evening , Mr. Cuffney .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Stone and Mr. Cuffney</speaker>
     <p>Good-evening , ma'am .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Sit down , if you please . They all sit .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Stone</speaker>
     <p>This is a great evening for you , ma'am .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>It is .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Cuffney</speaker>
     <p>What time do you expect the deputation , ma'am ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>They should be here at seven o'clock .<stage>With an inquisitive nose .</stage>Surely , Abraham has n't been smoking .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Stone</speaker>
     <p><stage>rising</stage>Shall I open the window , ma'am ? It gets close of an evening .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Lincoln</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>: Naturally , in March . You may leave the window , Samuel</l>
      <l>Stone . We do not smoke in the parlour .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Stone</speaker>
     <p><stage>resuming his seat</stage>By no means , ma'am .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>I shall be obliged to you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Cuffney</speaker>
     <p>Has Abraham decided what he will say to the invitation ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>He will accept it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Stone</speaker>
     <p>A very right decision , if I may say so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>It is .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Cuffney</speaker>
     <p>And you , ma'am , have advised him that way , I 'll be bound .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>You said this was a great evening for me . It is , and I 'll say more than I mostly do , because it is . I 'm likely to go into history now with a great man . For I know better than any how great he is . I 'm plain looking and I 've a sharp tongue , and I 've a mind that does n't always go in his easy , high way . And that 's what history will see , and it will laugh a little , and say , “ Poor Abraham Lincoln . ” That 's all right , but it 's not all . I 've always known when he should go forward , and when he should hold back . I 've watched , and watched , and what I 've learnt America will profit by . There are women like that , lots of them . But I 'm lucky . My work 's going farther than Illinois — it 's going farther than any of us can tell . I made things easy for him to think and think when we were poor , and now his thinking has brought him to this . They wanted to make him Governor of Oregon , and he would have gone and have come to nothing there . I stopped him . Now they 're coming to ask him to be President , and I 've told him to go .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Stone</speaker>
     <p>If you please , ma'am , I should like to apologise for smoking in here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>That 's no matter , Samuel Stone . Only , do n't do it again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Cuffney</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>: It 's a great place for a man to fill . Do you know how</l>
      <l>Seward takes Abraham 's nomination by the Republicans ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Seward is ambitious . He expected the nomination . Abraham will know how to use him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Stone</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>: The split among the Democrats makes the election of the</l>
      <l>Republican choice a certainty , I suppose ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Abraham says so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Cuffney</speaker>
     <p>You know , it 's hard to believe . When I think of the times I 've sat in this room of an evening , and seen your husband come in , ma'am , with his battered hat nigh falling off the back of his head , and stuffed with papers that wo n't go into his pockets , and god-darning some rascal who 'd done him about an assignment or a trespass , I can n't think he 's going up there into the eyes of the world .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>I 've tried for years to make him buy a new hat .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Cuffney</speaker>
     <p>I have a very large selection just in from New York . Perhaps Abraham might allow me to offer him one for his departure .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>He might . But he 'll wear the old one .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Stone</speaker>
     <p>Slavery and the South . They 're big things he 'll have to deal with . “ The end of that is not yet . ” That 's what old John Brown said , “ the end of that is not yet . ” ABRAHAM LINCOLN comes in , a greenish and crumpled top hat leaving his forehead well uncovered , his wide pockets brimming over with documents . He is fifty , and he still preserves his clean-shaven state . He kisses his wife and shakes hands with his friends .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Well , Mary . How d'ye do , Samuel . How d'ye do , Timothy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Stone and Mr. Cuffney</speaker>
     <p>Good-evening , Abraham . Lincoln<stage>while he takes of his hat and shakes out sundry papers from the lining into a drawer</stage>John Brown , did you say ? Aye , John Brown . But that 's not the way it 's to be done . And you can n't do the right thing the wrong way . That 's as bad as the wrong thing , if you 're going to keep the state together .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Cuffney</speaker>
     <p>Well , we 'll be going . We only came in to give you good-faring , so to say , in the great word you 've got to speak this evening .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mr. Stone</speaker>
     <p>It makes a humble body almost afraid of himself , Abraham , to know his friend is to be one of the great ones of the earth , with his yes and no law for these many , many thousands of folk .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>It makes a man humble to be chosen so , Samuel . So humble that no man but would say “ No ” to such bidding if he dare . To be President of this people , and trouble gathering everywhere in men 's hearts . That 's a searching thing . Bitterness , and scorn , and wrestling often with men I shall despise , and perhaps nothing truly done at the end . But I must go . Yes . Thank you , Samuel ; thank you , Timothy . Just a glass of that cordial , Mary , before they leave . He goes to a cupboard . May the devil smudge that girl ! Calling at the door . Susan ! Susan Deddington !

     <p>It 's all right , Abraham . I told the girl to keep it out . The cupboard 's choked with papers . Susan<stage>coming in with bottle and glasses</stage>I 'm sure I 'm sorry . I was told —</p>

     <p>Good . Five minutes to seven . You 're sure about it , Mary ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Yes . Are n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>We mean to set bounds to slavery . The South will resist . They may try to break away from the Union . That cannot be allowed . If the Union is set aside America will crumble . The saving of it may mean blood .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Who is to shape it all if you do n't ?</p>

     <speaker>Mrs. Lincoln</speaker>
     <p><stage>after a moment</stage>This hat is a disgrace to you , Abraham . You pay no heed to what I say , and you think it does n't matter . A man like you ought to think a little about gentility .</p>

     <p>To be sure . I forget .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>You do n't . You just do n't heed . Samuel Stone 's been smoking in here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>He 's a careless , poor fellow .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>He is , and a fine example you set him . You do n't care whether he makes my parlour smell poison or not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Of course I do —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>You do n't . Your head is too stuffed with things to think about my ways . I 've got neighbours if you have n't .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Well , now , your neighbours are mine , I suppose .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Then why wo n't you consider appearances a little ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Certainly . I must .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Will you get a new hat ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I must see about it .</p>

     <speaker>Mrs. Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>When ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>In a day or two . Before long .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Abraham , I 've got a better temper than anybody will ever guess .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>You have , my dear . And you need it , I confess . SUSAN comes in .</p>

     <p>The gentlemen have come .</p>

     <p>Does the master want a handkerchief , ma'am ? He did n't take one this morning .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>It 's no matter now , Susan .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>If you please , I 've brought you one , sir . She gives it to him , and goes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>I 'll send them in . Abraham , I believe in you .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>I know , I know .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MRS. LINCOLN goes out . LINCOLN moves to a map of the United States that is hanging on the wall , and stands silently looking at it . After a few moments SUSAN comes to the door .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>This way , please . She shows in WILLIAM TUCKER , a florid , prosperous merchant ; HENRY HIND , an alert little attorney ; ELIAS PRICE , a lean lay preacher ; and JAMES MACINTOSH , the editor of a Republican journal . SUSAN goes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tucker</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Lincoln . Tucker my name is — William Tucker . He presents his companions .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Mr. Henry Hind — follows your profession , Mr. Lincoln . Leader of the bar in Ohio . Mr. Elias Price , of Pennsylvania . You 've heard him preach , maybe . James Macintosh you know . I come from Chicago .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Gentlemen , at your service . How d'ye do , James . Will you be seated ? They sit round the table .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tucker</speaker>
     <p>I have the honour to be chairman of this delegation . We are sent from Chicago by the Republican Convention , to enquire whether you will accept their invitation to become the Republican candidate for the office of President of the United States .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Price</speaker>
     <p>The Convention is aware , Mr. Lincoln , that under the circumstances , seeing that the Democrats have split , this is more than an invitation to candidature . Their nominee is almost certain to be elected .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Gentlemen , I am known to one of you only . Do you know my many disqualifications for this work ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hind</speaker>
     <p>It 's only fair to say that they have been discussed freely .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>There are some , shall we say graces , that I lack . Washington does not altogether neglect these .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tucker</speaker>
     <p>They have been spoken of . But these are days , Mr. Lincoln , if I may say so , too difficult , too dangerous , for these to weigh at the expense of other qualities that you were considered to possess .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Seward and Hook have both had great experience .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Macintosh</speaker>
     <p>Hook had no strong support . For Seward , there are doubts as to his discretion .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Do not be under any misunderstanding , I beg you . I aim at moderation so far as it is honest . But I am a very stubborn man , gentlemen . If the South insists upon the extension of slavery , and claims the right to secede , as you know it very well may do , and the decision lies with me , it will mean resistance , inexorable , with blood if needs be . I would have everybody 's mind clear as to that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Price</speaker>
     <p>It will be for you to decide , and we believe you to be an upright man , Mr. Lincoln .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Seward and Hook would be difficult to carry as subordinates .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tucker</speaker>
     <p>But they will have to be carried so , and there 's none likelier for the job than you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>: Will your Republican Press stand by me for a principle ,</l>
      <l>James , whatever comes ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Macintosh</speaker>
     <p>There 's no other man we would follow so readily .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>If you send me , the South will have little but derision for your choice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hind</speaker>
     <p>We believe that you 'll last out their laughter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>I can take any man 's ridicule — I 'm trained to it by a ... somewhat odd figure that it pleased God to give me , if I may so far be pleasant with you . But this slavery business will be long , and deep , and bitter . I know it . If you do me this honour , gentlemen , you must look to me for no compromise in this matter . If abolition comes in due time by constitutional means , good . I want it . But , while we will not force abolition , we will give slavery no approval , and we will not allow it to extend its boundaries by one yard . The determination is in my blood . When I was a boy I made a trip to New Orleans , and there I saw them , chained , beaten , kicked as a man would be ashamed to kick a thieving dog . And I saw a young girl driven up and down the room that the bidders might satisfy themselves . And I said then , “ If ever I get a chance to hit that thing , I 'll hit it hard . ” A pause . You have no conditions to make ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tucker</speaker>
     <p>None . Lincoln<stage>rising</stage>Mrs. Lincoln and I would wish you to take supper with us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tucker</speaker>
     <p>That 's very kind , I 'm sure . And your answer , Mr. Lincoln ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>When you came , you did not know me , Mr. Tucker . You may have something to say now not for my ears .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tucker</speaker>
     <p>Nothing in the world , I assure —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>I will prepare Mrs. Lincoln . You will excuse me for no more than a minute . He goes out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tucker</speaker>
     <p>Well , we might have chosen a handsomer article , but I doubt whether we could have chosen a better .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hind</speaker>
     <p>He would make a great judge — if you were n't prosecuting .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Price</speaker>
     <p>I 'd tell most people , but I 'd ask that man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tucker</speaker>
     <p>He has n't given us yes or no yet . Why should he leave us like that , as though plain was n't plain ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hind</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps he wanted a thought by himself first .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Macintosh</speaker>
     <p>It was n't that . But he was right . Abraham Lincoln sees deeper into men 's hearts than most . He knows this day will be a memory to us all our lives . Under his eye , which of you could have given play to any untoward thought that had started in you against him since you came into this room ? But , leaving you , he knew you could test yourselves to your own ease , and speak the more confident for it , and , if you found yourselves clean of doubt , carry it all the happier in your minds after . Is there a doubt among us ? Tucker :} Hind : } No , none . Price : }</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Macintosh</speaker>
     <p>Then , Mr. Tucker , ask him again when he comes back .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tucker</speaker>
     <p>I will . They sit in silence for a moment , and Lincoln comes in again , back to his place at the table .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>I would n't have you think it graceless of me to be slow in my answer . But once given , it 's for the deep good or the deep ill of all this country . In the face of that a man may well ask himself twenty times , when he 's twenty times sure . You make no qualification , any one among you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Tucker</speaker>
     <p>None . The invitation is as I put it when we sat down . And I would add that we are , all of us , proud to bear it to a man as to whom we feel there is none so fitted to receive it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>I thank you . I accept . He rises , the others with him . He goes to the door and calls . Susan . There is silence . SUSAN comes in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>Yes , Mr. Lincoln .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Take these gentlemen to Mrs. Lincoln . I will follow at once . The four men go with SUSAN . LINCOLN stands silently for a moment . He goes again to the map and looks at it . He then turns to the table again , and kneels beside it , possessed and deliberate , burying his face in his hands . THE CURTAIN FALLS . The two Chroniclers : Lonely is the man who understands . Lonely is vision that leads a man away From the pasture-lands , From the furrows of corn and the brown loads of hay , To the mountain-side , To the high places where contemplation brings All his adventurings Among the sowers and the tillers in the wide Valleys to one fused experience , That shall control The courses of his soul , And give his hand Courage and continence . The First Chronicler : Shall a man understand , He shall know bitterness because his kind , Being perplexed of mind , Hold issues even that are nothing mated . And he shall give Counsel out of his wisdom that none shall hear ; And steadfast in vain persuasion must he live , And unabated Shall his temptation be .</p>

    <head type="scene">SCENE II .</head>
    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>Ten months later . Seward 's room at Washington . WILLIAM H. SEWARD , Secretary of State , is seated at his table with JOHNSON WHITE and CALEB JENNINGS , representing the Commissioners of the Confederate States .</stage>
    </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>White</speaker>
     <p>It 's the common feeling in the South , Mr. Seward , that you 're the one man at Washington to see this thing with large imagination . I say this with no disrespect to the President .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>I appreciate your kindness , Mr. White . But the Union is the Union — you can n't get over that . We are faced with a plain fact . Seven of the Southern States have already declared for secession . The President feels — and I may say that I and my colleagues are with him — that to break up the country like that means the decline of America .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jennings</speaker>
     <p>But everything might be done by compromise , Mr. Seward . Withdraw your garrison from Fort Sumter , Beauregard will be instructed to take no further action , South Carolina will be satisfied with the recognition of her authority , and , as likely as not , be willing to give the lead to the other states in reconsidering secession .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>It is certainly a very attractive and , I conceive , a humane proposal .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>White</speaker>
     <p>By furthering it you might be the saviour of the country from civil war , Mr. Seward .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>The President dwelt on his resolution to hold Fort Sumter in his inaugural address . It will be difficult to persuade him to go back on that . He 's firm in his decisions .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>White</speaker>
     <p>There are people who would call him stubborn . Surely if it were put to him tactfully that so simple a course might avert incalculable disaster , no man would nurse his dignity to the point of not yielding . I speak plainly , but it 's a time for plain speaking . Mr. Lincoln is doubtless a man of remarkable qualities : on the two occasions when I have spoken to him I have not been unimpressed . That is so , Mr. Jennings ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jennings</speaker>
     <p>Certainly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>White</speaker>
     <p>But what does his experience of great affairs of state amount to beside yours , Mr. Seward ? He must know how much he depends on certain members of his Cabinet , I might say upon a certain member , for advice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>We have to move warily .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jennings</speaker>
     <p>Naturally . A man is sensitive , doubtless , in his first taste of office .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>My support of the President is , of course , unquestionable .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>White</speaker>
     <p>Oh , entirely . But how can your support be more valuable than in lending him your unequalled understanding ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>The whole thing is coloured in his mind by the question of slavery .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jennings</speaker>
     <p>Disabuse his mind . Slavery is nothing . Persuade him to withdraw from Fort Sumter , and slavery can be settled round a table . You know there 's a considerable support even for abolition in the South itself . If the trade has to be allowed in some districts , what is that compared to the disaster of civil war ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>White</speaker>
     <p>We do not believe that the Southern States wish with any enthusiasm to secede . They merely wish to establish their right to do so . Acknowledge that by evacuating Fort Sumter , and nothing will come of it but a perfectly proper concession to an independence of spirit that is not disloyal to the Union at heart .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>You understand , of course , that I can say nothing officially .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jennings</speaker>
     <p>These are nothing but informal suggestions .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>But I may tell you that I am not unsympathetic .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>White</speaker>
     <p>We were sure that that would be so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>And my word is not without influence .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jennings</speaker>
     <p>It can be used to bring you very great credit , Mr. Seward .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>In the mean time , you will say nothing of this interview , beyond making your reports , which should be confidential .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>White</speaker>
     <p>You may rely upon us . Seward<stage>rising with the others</stage>Then I will bid you good-morning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>White</speaker>
     <p>We are profoundly sensible of the magnanimous temper in which we are convinced you will conduct this grave business . Good-morning , Mr. Seward .</p>

     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>Thank you . THE CLERK goes . This is unfortunate . Say nothing , and go at once . LINCOLN comes in , now whiskered and bearded .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Good-morning , Mr. Seward . Good-morning , gentlemen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>Good-morning , Mr. President . And I am obliged to you for calling , gentlemen . Good-morning . He moves towards the door .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps these gentlemen could spare me ten minutes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>White</speaker>
     <p>It might not —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Say five minutes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jennings</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps you would —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>I am anxious always for any opportunity to exchange views with our friends of the South . Much enlightenment may be gained in five minutes . Be seated , I beg you — if Mr. Seward will allow us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>By all means . Shall I leave you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Leave us — but why ? I may want your support , Mr. Secretary , if we should not wholly agree . Be seated , gentlemen . SEWARD places a chair for LINCOLN , and they sit at the table . You have messages for us ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>White</speaker>
     <p>Well , no , we can n't say that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>No messages ? Perhaps I am inquisitive ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>These gentlemen are anxious to sound any moderating influences .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>I trust they bring moderating influences with them . You will find me a ready listener , gentlemen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jennings</speaker>
     <p>It 's a delicate matter , Mr. Lincoln . Ours is just an informal visit .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Quite , quite . But we shall lose nothing by knowing each other 's minds .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>White</speaker>
     <p>Shall we tell the President what we came to say , Mr. Seward ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>I shall be grateful . If I should fail to understand , Mr. Seward , no doubt , will enlighten me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jennings</speaker>
     <p>We thought it hardly worth while to trouble you at so early a stage .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>So early a stage of what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jennings</speaker>
     <p>I mean —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>These gentlemen , in a common anxiety for peace , were merely seeking the best channel through which suggestions could be made .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>To whom ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>To the government .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>The head of the government is here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>White</speaker>
     <p>But —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Come , gentlemen . What is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jennings</speaker>
     <p>It 's this matter of Fort Sumter , Mr. President . If you withdraw your garrison from Fort Sumter it wo n't be looked upon as weakness in you . It will merely be looked upon as a concession to a natural privilege . We believe that the South at heart does not want secession . It wants to establish the right to decide for itself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>The South wants the stamp of national approval upon slavery . It can n't have it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>White</speaker>
     <p>Surely that 's not the point . There 's no law in the South against slavery .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Laws come from opinion , Mr. White . The South knows it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jennings</speaker>
     <p>Mr. President , if I may say so , you do n't quite understand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Does Mr. Seward understand ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>White</speaker>
     <p>We believe so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>You are wrong . He does n't understand , because you did n't mean him to . I do n't blame you . You think you are acting for the best . You think you 've got an honest case . But I 'll put your case for you , and I 'll put it naked . Many people in this country want abolition ; many do n't . I 'll say nothing for the moment as to the rights and wrongs of it . But every man , whether he wants it or not , knows it may come . Why does the South propose secession ? Because it knows abolition may come , and it wants to avoid it . It wants more : it wants the right to extend the slave foundation . We 've all been to blame for slavery , but we in the North have been willing to mend our ways . You have not . So you 'll secede , and make your own laws . But you were n't prepared for resistance ; you do n't want resistance . And you hope that if you can tide over the first crisis and make us give way , opinion will prevent us from opposing you with force again , and you 'll be able to get your own way about the slave business by threats . That 's your case . You did n't say so to Mr. Seward , but it is . Now , I 'll give you my answer . Gentlemen , it 's no good hiding this thing in a corner . It 's got to be settled . I said the other day that Fort Sumter would be held as long as we could hold it . I said it because I know exactly what it means . Why are you investing it ? Say , if you like , it 's to establish your right of secession with no purpose of exercising it . Why do you want to establish that right ? Because now we will allow no extension of slavery , and because some day we may abolish it . You can n't deny it ; there 's no other answer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jennings</speaker>
     <p>I see how it is . You may force freedom as much as you like , but we are to beware how we force slavery .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>It could n't be put better , Mr. Jennings . That 's what the Union means . It is a Union that stands for common right . That is its foundation — that is why it is for every honest man to preserve it . Be clear about this issue . If there is war , it will not be on the slave question . If the South is loyal to the Union , it can fight slave legislation by constitutional means , and win its way if it can . If it claims the right to secede , then to preserve this country from disruption , to maintain that right to which every state pledged itself when the Union was won for us by our fathers , war may be the only way . We wo n't break up the Union , and you sha n't . In your hands , and not in mine , is the momentous issue of civil war . You can have no conflict without yourselves being the aggressors . I am loath to close . We are not enemies , but friends . We must not be enemies . Though passion may have strained , do not allow it to break our bonds of affection . That is our answer . Tell them that . Will you tell them that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>White</speaker>
     <p>You are determined ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>I beg you to tell them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jennings</speaker>
     <p>It shall be as you wish .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Implore them to order Beauregard 's return . You can telegraph it now , from here . Will you do that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>White</speaker>
     <p>If you wish it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Earnestly . Mr. Seward , will you please place a clerk at their service . Ask for an answer . SEWARD rings a bell . A CLERK comes in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>Give these gentlemen a private wire . Place yourself at their disposal .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Clerk</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir . WHITE and JENNINGS go out with the CLERK . For a moment LINCOLN and SEWARD are silent , LINCOLN pacing the room , SEWARD standing at the table .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Seward , this wo n't do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>You do n't suspect —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>I do not . But let us be plain . No man can say how wisely , but Providence has brought me to the leadership of this country , with a task before me greater than that which rested on Washington himself . When I made my Cabinet , you were the first man I chose . I do not regret it . I think I never shall . But remember , faith earns faith . What is it ? Why did n't those men come to see me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>They thought my word might bear more weight with you than theirs .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Your word for what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>Discretion about Fort Sumter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Discretion ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>It 's devastating , this thought of war .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>It is . Do you think I 'm less sensible of that than you ? War should be impossible . But you can only make it impossible by destroying its causes . Do n't you see that to withdraw from Fort Sumter is to do nothing of the kind ? If one half of this country claims the right to disown the Union , the claim in the eyes of every true guardian among us must be a cause for war , unless we hold the Union to be a false thing instead of the public consent to decent principles of life that it is . If we withdraw from Fort Sumter , we do nothing to destroy that cause . We can only destroy it by convincing them that secession is a betrayal of their trust . Please God we may do so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>Has there , perhaps , been some timidity in making all this clear to the country ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Timidity ? And you were talking of discretion .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>I mean that perhaps our policy has not been sufficiently defined .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>And have you not concurred in all our decisions ? Do not deceive yourself . You urge me to discretion in one breath and tax me with timidity in the next . While there was hope that they might call Beauregard back out of their own good sense , I was determined to say nothing to inflame them . Do you call that timidity ? Now their intention is clear , and you 've heard me speak this morning clearly also . And now you talk about discretion — you , who call what was discretion at the right time , timidity , now counsel timidity at the wrong time , and call it discretion . Seward , you may think I 'm simple , but I can see your mind working as plainly as you might see the innards of a clock . You can bring great gifts to this government , with your zeal , and your administrative experience , and your love of men . Do n't spoil it by thinking I 've got a dull brain . Seward<stage>slowly</stage>Yes , I see . I 've not been thinking quite clearly about it all . Lincoln<stage>taking a paper from his pocket</stage>Here 's the paper you sent me . “ Some Thoughts for the President 's Consideration . Great Britain ... Russia ... Mexico ... policy . Either the President must control this himself , or devolve it on some member of his Cabinet . It is not in my especial province , but I neither seek to evade nor assume responsibility . ” There is a pause , the two men looking at each , other without speaking . LINCOLN hands the paper to SEWARD , who holds it for a moment , tears it up and throws it into his basket .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>I beg your pardon . Lincoln<stage>taking his hand</stage>That 's brave of you . JOHN HAY , a Secretary , comes in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hay</speaker>
     <p>There 's a messenger from Major Anderson , sir . He 's ridden straight from Fort Sumter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Take him to my room . No , bring him here . HAY goes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>What does it mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>I do n't like the sound of it . He rings a bell . A CLERK comes in . Are there any gentlemen of the Cabinet in the house ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Clerk</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Chase and Mr. Blair , I believe , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>My compliments to them , and will they be prepared to see me here at once if necessary . Send the same message to any other ministers you can find .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Clerk</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir . He goes .</p>

      <l>: We may have to decide now — now .</l>
      <l>HAY shows in a perspiring and dust-covered</l>
      <l>MESSENGER , and retires . From Major Anderson ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>The Messenger</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir . Word of mouth , sir .</p>

     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Your credentials ? The Messenger<stage>giving LINCOLN a paper</stage>Here , sir . Lincoln<stage>glancing at it</stage>Well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>The Messenger</speaker>
     <p>Major Anderson presents his duty to the government . He can hold the Fort three days more without provisions and reinforcements . LINCOLN rings the bell , and waits until a third CLERK comes in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>See if Mr. White and Mr. Jennings have had any answer yet . Mr .— what 's his name ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>Hawkins .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>Mr. Hawkins is attending to them . And ask Mr. Hay to come here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Clerk</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>He goes . LINCOLN sits at the table and writes . HAY comes in . Lincoln</speaker>
     <p><stage>writing</stage>Mr. Hay , do you know where General Scott is ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hay</speaker>
     <p>At headquarters , I think , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Take this to him yourself and bring an answer back .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hay</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir . He takes the note , and goes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Are things very bad at the Fort ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>The Messenger</speaker>
     <p>The major says three days , sir . Most of us would have said twenty-four hours . A knock at the door .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>Yes . HAWKINS comes in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hawkins</speaker>
     <p>Mr. White is just receiving a message across the wire , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Ask him to come here directly he 's finished .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hawkins</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes . LINCOLN goes to a far door and opens it . He speaks to the MESSENGER .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Will you wait in here ? The MESSENGER goes through .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>Do you mind if I smoke ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Not at all , not at all . SEWARD lights a cigar .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Three days . If White 's message does n't help us — three days .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>But surely we must withdraw as a matter of military necessity now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Why does n't White come ? SEWARD goes to the window and throws it up . He stands looking down into the street . LINCOLN stands at the table looking fixedly at the door . After a moment or two there is a knock . Come in . HAWKINS shows in WHITE and JENNINGS , and goes out . SEWARD closes the window . Well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>White</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sorry . They wo n't give way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>You told them all I said ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jennings</speaker>
     <p>Everything .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>It 's critical .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>White</speaker>
     <p>They are definite . LINCOLN paces once or twice up and down the room , standing again at his place at the table .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>They leave no opening ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>White</speaker>
     <p>I regret to say , none .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>It 's a grave decision . Terribly grave . Thank you , gentlemen . Good-morning . White and Jennings : Good-morning , gentlemen . They go out .</p>

      <l>Did you take my messages ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>The Clerk</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir . Mr. Chase and Mr. Blair are here . The other ministers are coming immediately .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Ask them to come here at once . And send Mr. Hay in directly he returns .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>The Clerk</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>: Yes , sir .</l>
      <l>He goes .</l>
      <l>Lincoln</l>
      <stage>after a pause</stage>
      <l>: “ There is a tide in the affairs of men ... ”</l>
      <l>Do you read Shakespeare , Seward ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>Shakespeare ? No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Ah !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>SALMON P. CHASE , Secretary of the Treasury , and MONTGOMERY BLAIR , Postmaster-General , come in . Good-morning , Mr. Chase , Mr. Blair .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>Good-morning , gentlemen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Blair</speaker>
     <p>Good-morning , Mr. President . How d'ye do , Mr. Seward .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Chase</speaker>
     <p>Good-morning , Mr. President . Something urgent ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Let us be seated . As they draw chairs up to the table , the other members of the Cabinet , SIMON CAMERON , CALEB SMITH , BURNET HOOK , and GIDEON WELLES , come in . There is an exchange of greetings , while they arrange themselves round the table . Gentlemen , we meet in a crisis , the most fateful , perhaps , that has ever faced any government in this country . It can be stated briefly . A message has just come from Anderson . He can hold Fort Sumter three days at most unless we send men and provisions .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cameron</speaker>
     <p>How many men ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>I shall know from Scott in a few minutes how many are necessary .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Welles</speaker>
     <p>Suppose we have n't as many .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Then it 's a question of provisioning . We may not be able to do enough to be effective . The question is whether we shall do as much as we can .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>If we withdrew altogether , would n't it give the South a lead towards compromise , as being an acknowledgment of their authority , while leaving us free to plead military necessity if we found public opinion dangerous ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>My mind is clear . To do less than we can do , whatever that may be , will be fundamentally to allow the South 's claim to right of secession . That is my opinion . If you evade the question now , you will have to answer it to-morrow .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Blair</speaker>
     <p>I agree with the President .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>We ought to defer action as long as possible . I consider that we should withdraw .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Do n't you see that to withdraw may postpone war , but that it will make it inevitable in the end ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Smith</speaker>
     <p>It is inevitable if we resist .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>I fear it will be so . But in that case we shall enter it with uncompromised principles . Mr. Chase ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Chase</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>: It is difficult . But , on the whole , my opinion is with yours ,</l>
      <l>Mr. President .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>And you , Seward ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>I respect your opinion , but I must differ . A knock at the door .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Come in . HAY comes in . He gives a letter to LINCOLN and goes .<stage>Reading</stage>Scott says twenty thousand men .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>We have n't ten thousand ready .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>It remains a question of sending provisions . I charge you , all of you , to weigh this thing with all your understanding . To temporise now , cannot , in my opinion , avert war . To speak plainly to the world in standing by our resolution to hold Fort Sumter with all our means , and in a plain declaration that the Union must be preserved , will leave us with a clean cause , simply and loyally supported . I tremble at the thought of war . But we have in our hands a sacred trust . It is threatened . We have had no thought of aggression . We have been the aggressed . Persuasion has failed , and I conceive it to be our duty to resist . To withhold supplies from Anderson would be to deny that duty . Gentlemen , the matter is before you . A pause . For provisioning the fort ? LINCOLN , CHASE , and BLAIR hold up their hands . For immediate withdrawal ? SEWARD , CAMERON , SMITH , HOOK , and WELLES hold up their hands . There is a pause of some moments . Gentlemen , I may have to take upon myself the responsibility of over-riding your vote . It will be for me to satisfy Congress and public opinion . Should I receive any resignations ? There is silence . I thank you for your consideration , gentlemen . That is all . They rise , and the Ministers , with the exception of SEWARD , go out , talking as they pass beyond the door . You are wrong , Seward , wrong .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>I believe you . I respect your judgment even as far as that . But I must speak as I feel .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>May I speak to this man alone ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>Certainly . He goes out . LINCOLN stands motionless for a moment . Then he moves to a map of the United States , much larger than the one in his Illinois home , and looks at it as he did there . He goes to the far door and opens it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Will you come in ? The MESSENGER comes . Can you ride back to Major Anderson at once ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>The Messenger</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Tell him that we cannot reinforce him immediately . We have n't the men .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>The Messenger</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

    <stage>Mr. Hay , please .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hawkins</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir . He goes , and a moment later HAY comes in .</p>

     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Go to General Scott . Ask him to come to me at once .</p>

The two together : Kinsmen , what is mother-wit But the light of these ? Knowing these , what is there more For learning in your little years ? Are not these all gospels bright Shining on your day ? How then shall your hearts be sore With envy and her brood of fears , How forget the words of light From the mountain-way ? ... Blessed are the merciful .... Does not every threshold seek Meadows and the flight of birds For compassion still ? Blessed are the merciful .... Are we pilgrims yet to speak Out of Olivet the words Of knowledge and good-will ?</p>

     <stage>A small reception room at the White House . MRS. LINCOLN , dressed in a fashion perhaps a little too considered , despairing as she now does of any sartorial grace in her husband , and acutely conscious that she must meet this necessity of office alone , is writing .

     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>Yes , ma'am . But you see , ma'am , it 's difficult after calling him Mr. Lincoln for fifteen years .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Lincoln</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>: But you must remember . Everybody calls him the</l>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>No , ma'am . There 's a good many people call him Father Abraham now . And there 's some that like him even better than that . Only to-day Mr. Coldpenny , at the stores , said , “ Well , Susan , and how 's old Abe this morning ? ”</p>

     <p>Yes . He 's rather tired .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Blow</speaker>
     <p>Of course , to be sure . This dreadful war . But I hope he 's not getting tired of the war .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>It 's a constant anxiety for him . He feels his responsibility very deeply .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Blow</speaker>
     <p>To be sure . But you must n't let him get war-weary . These monsters in the South have got to be stamped out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>I do n't think you need be afraid of the President 's firmness .</p>

     <p>Oh , of course not . I was only saying to Goliath yesterday , “ The President will never give way till he has the South squealing , ” and Goliath agreed . SUSAN comes in .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Otherly</speaker>
     <p>Three years ? That would be terrible , would n't it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Blow</speaker>
     <p>We must be prepared to make sacrifices .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Otherly</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Blow</speaker>
     <p>It makes my blood boil to think of those people .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Otherly</speaker>
     <p>I used to know a lot of them . Some of them were very kind and nice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Blow</speaker>
     <p>That was just their cunning , depend on it . I 'm afraid there 's a good deal of disloyalty among us . Shall we see the dear President this afternoon , Mrs. Lincoln ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>He will be here directly , I think .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Blow</speaker>
     <p>You ‘ re looking wonderfully well , with all the hard work that you have to do . I 've really had to drop some of mine . And with expenses going up , it 's all very lowering , do n't you think ? Goliath and I have had to reduce several of our subscriptions . But , of course , we all have to deny ourselves something . Ah , good-afternoon , dear Mr. President . LINCOLN comes in . THE LADIES rise and shake hands with him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Good-afternoon , ladies .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Otherly</speaker>
     <p>Good-afternoon , Mr. President . They all sit .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Blow</speaker>
     <p>And is there any startling news , Mr. President ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Madam , every morning when I wake up , and say to myself , a hundred , or two hundred , or a thousand of my countrymen will be killed to-day , I find it startling .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Blow</speaker>
     <p>Oh , yes , of course , to be sure . But I mean , is there any good news .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Yes . There is news of a victory . They lost twenty-seven hundred men — we lost eight hundred .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Blow</speaker>
     <p>How splendid !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Thirty-five hundred .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Blow</speaker>
     <p>Oh , but you must n't talk like that , Mr. President . There were only eight hundred that mattered .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>The world is larger than your heart , madam .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Blow</speaker>
     <p>Now the dear President is becoming whimsical , Mrs. Lincoln . SUSAN brings in tea-tray , and hands tea round . LINCOLN takes none . SUSAN goes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Otherly</speaker>
     <p>Mr. President .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Yes , ma'am .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Otherly</speaker>
     <p>I do n't like to impose upon your hospitality . I know how difficult everything is for you . But one has to take one 's opportunities . May I ask you a question ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Certainly , ma'am .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Otherly</speaker>
     <p>Is n't it possible for you to stop this war ? In the name of a suffering country , I ask you that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Blow</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sure such a question would never have entered my head .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>It is a perfectly right question . Ma'am , I have but one thought always — how can this thing be stopped ? But we must ensure the integrity of the Union . In two years war has become an hourly bitterness to me . I believe I suffer no less than any man . But it must be endured . The cause was a right one two years ago . It is unchanged .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Otherly</speaker>
     <p>I know you are noble and generous . But I believe that war must be wrong under any circumstances , for any cause .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Blow</speaker>
     <p>I 'm afraid the President would have but little encouragement if he listened often to this kind of talk .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>I beg you not to harass yourself , madam . Ma'am , I too believe war to be wrong . It is the weakness and the jealousy and the folly of men that make a thing so wrong possible . But we are all weak , and jealous , and foolish . That 's how the world is , ma'am , and we cannot outstrip the world . Some of the worst of us are sullen , aggressive still — just clumsy , greedy pirates . Some of us have grown out of that . But the best of us have an instinct to resist aggression if it wo n't listen to persuasion . You may say it 's a wrong instinct . I do n't know . But it 's there , and it 's there in millions of good men . I do n't believe it 's a wrong instinct , I believe that the world must come to wisdom slowly . It is for us who hate aggression to persuade men always and earnestly against it , and hope that , little by little , they will hear us . But in the mean time there will come moments when the aggressors will force the instinct to resistance to act . Then we must act earnestly , praying always in our courage that never again will this thing happen . And then we must turn again , and again , and again to persuasion . This appeal to force is the misdeed of an imperfect world . But we are imperfect . We must strive to purify the world , but we must not think ourselves pure above the world . When I had this thing to decide , it would have been easy to say , “ No , I will have none of it ; it is evil , and I will not touch it . ” But that would have decided nothing , and I saw what I believed to be the truth as I now put it to you , ma'am . It 's a forlorn thing for any man to have this responsibility in his heart . I may see wrongly , but that 's how I see .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Blow</speaker>
     <p>I quite agree with you , Mr. President . These brutes in the South must be taught , though I doubt whether you can teach them anything except by destroying them . That 's what Goliath says .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Goliath must be getting quite an old man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Blow</speaker>
     <p>Indeed , he 's not , Mr. President Goliath is only thirty-eight .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Really , now ? Perhaps I might be able to get him a commission .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Blow</speaker>
     <p>Oh , no . Goliath could n't be spared . He 's doing contracts for the government , you know . Goliath could n't possibly go . I 'm sure he will be very pleased when I tell him what you say about these people who want to stop the war , Mr. President . I hope Mrs. Otherly is satisfied . Of course , we could all complain . We all have to make sacrifices , as I told Mrs. Otherly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Otherly</speaker>
     <p>Thank you , Mr. President , for what you 've said . I must try to think about it . But I always believed war to be wrong . I did n't want my boy to go , because I believed it to be wrong . But he would . That came to me last week . She hands a paper to LINCOLN . Lincoln<stage>looks at it , rises , and hands it back to her</stage>Ma'am , there are times when no man may speak . I grieve for you , I grieve for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Otherly</speaker>
     <p><stage>rising</stage>I think I will go . You do n't mind my saying what I did ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>We are all poor creatures , ma'am . Think kindly of me .<stage>He takes her hand .</stage>Mary .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MRS. LINCOLN goes out with MRS. OTHERLY .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Mrs. Blow</speaker>
     <p>Of course it 's very sad for her , poor woman . But she makes her trouble worse by these perverted views , does n't she ? And , I hope you will show no signs of weakening , Mr. President , till it has been made impossible for those shameful rebels to hold up their heads again . Goliath says you ought to make a proclamation that no mercy will be shown to them afterwards . I 'm sure I shall never speak to one of them again . Rising . Well , I must be going . I 'll see Mrs. Lincoln as I go out . Good-afternoon , Mr. President . She turns at the door , and offers LINCOLN her handy which he does not take .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Good-afternoon , madam . And I 'd like to offer ye a word of advice . That poor mother told me what she thought . I do n't agree with her , but I honour her . She 's wrong , but she is noble . You 've told me what you think . I do n't agree with you , and I 'm ashamed of you and your like . You , who have sacrificed nothing , babble about destroying the South while other people conquer it . I accepted this war with a sick heart , and I 've a heart that 's near to breaking every day . I accepted it in the name of humanity , and just and merciful dealing , and the hope of love and charity on earth . And you come to me , talking of revenge and destruction , and malice , and enduring hate . These gentle people are mistaken , but they are mistaken cleanly , and in a great name . It is you that dishonour the cause for which we stand — it is you who would make it a mean and little thing . Good-afternoon . He opens the door and MRS. BLOW , finding words inadequate , goes . LINCOLN moves across the room and rings a bell . After a moment , SUSAN comes in . Susan , if that lady comes here again she may meet with an accident .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir . Is that all , sir ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>No , sir , it is not all , sir . I do n't like this coat . I am going to change it . I shall be back in a minute or two , and if a gentleman named Mr. William Custis calls , ask him to wait in here . He goes out . SUSAN collects the teacups . As she is going to the door a quiet , grave white-haired negro appears facing her . SUSAN starts violently . The Negro<stage>he talks slowly and very quietly</stage>It is all right .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>And who in the name of night might you be ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>The Negro</speaker>
     <p>Mista William Custis . Mista Lincoln tell me to come here . Nobody stop me , so I come to look for him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>Are you Mr. William Custis ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Lincoln will be here directly . He 's gone to change his coat . You 'd better sit down .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>Yes . He does so , looking about him with a certain pathetic inquisitiveness . Mista Lincoln live here . You his servant ? A very fine thing for young girl to be servant to Mista Lincoln .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>Well , we get on very well together .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>A very bad thing to be slave in South .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>Look here , you Mr. Custis , do n't you go mixing me up with slaves .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>No , you not slave . You servant , but you free body . That very mighty thing . A poor servant , born free .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>Yes , but look here , are you pitying me , with your poor servant ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>Pity ? No . I think you very mighty .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>Well , I do n't know so much about mighty . But I expect you 're right . It is n't every one that rises to the White House .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>It not every one that is free body . That is why you mighty .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>I 've never thought much about it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>I think always about it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>I suppose you 're free , are n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>Yes . Not born free . I was beaten when I a little nigger . I saw my mother — I will not remember what I saw .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sorry , Mr. Custis . That was wrong .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>Yes . Wrong .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>Are all nig — I mean are all black gentlemen like you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>No . I have advantages . They not many have advantages .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>No , I suppose not . Here 's Mr. Lincoln coming . LINCOLN , coated after his heart 's desire , comes to the door . CUSTIS rises . This is the gentleman you said , sir . She goes out with the tray .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Custis , I 'm very glad to see you . He offers his hand . CUSTIS takes it , and is about to kiss it . LINCOLN stops him gently .<stage>Sitting</stage>Sit down , will you ? Custis<stage>still standing , keeping his hat in his hand</stage>It very kind of Mista Lincoln ask me to come to see him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>I was afraid you might refuse .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>A little shy ? Yes . But so much to ask Glad to come .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Please sit down .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>Polite ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Please . I can n't sit myself , you see , if you do n't .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>Black , black . White , white .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Nonsense . Just two old men , sitting together<stage>CUSTIS sits to LINCOLN 'S gesture</stage>— and talking .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>I think I older man than Mista Lincoln .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I expect you are , I 'm fifty-four .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>I seventy-two .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>I hope I shall look as young when I 'm seventy-two .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>Cold water . Much walk . Believe in Lord Jesus Christ . Have always little herbs learnt when a little nigger . Mista Lincoln try . Very good . He hands a small twist of paper to LINCOLN .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Now , that 's uncommon kind of you . Thank you . I 've heard much about your preaching , Mr. Custis .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>I should like to hear you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>Mista Lincoln great friend of my people .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>I have come at length to a decision .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>A decision ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Slavery is going . We have been resolved always to confine it . Now it shall be abolished .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>You sure ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Sure . CUSTIS slowly stands up , bows his head , and sits again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>My people much to learn . Years , and years , and years . Ignorant , frightened , suspicious people . It will be difficult , very slow .<stage>With growing passion .</stage>But born free bodies . Free . I born slave , Mista Lincoln . No man understand who not born slave .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes . I understand . Custis<stage>with his normal regularity</stage>I think so . Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>I should like you to ask me any question you wish .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>I have some complaint . Perhaps I not understand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Tell me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>Southern soldiers take some black men prisoner . Black men in your uniform . Take them prisoner . Then murder them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>I know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>What you do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>We have sent a protest .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>No good . Must do more .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>What more can we do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>You know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Yes ; but do n't ask me for reprisals . Custis<stage>gleaming</stage>Eye for an eye , tooth for a tooth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>No , no . You must think . Think what you are saying .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>I think of murdered black men .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>You would not ask me to murder ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>Punish — not murder .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Yes , murder . How can I kill men in cold blood for what has been done by others ? Think what would follow . It is for us to set a great example , not to follow a wicked one . You do believe that , do n't you ? Custis<stage>after a pause</stage>I know . Yes . Let your light so shine before men . I trust Mista Lincoln . Will trust . I was wrong . I was too sorry for my people .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Will you remember this ? For more than two years I have thought of you every day . I have grown a weary man with thinking . But I shall not forget . I promise that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>You great , kind friend . I will love you . A knock at the door .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Yes . SUSAN comes in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>An officer gentleman . He says it 's very important .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>I 'll come . He and CUSTIS rise . Wait , will you , Mr. Custis ? I want to ask you some questions . He goes out . It is getting dark , and SUSAN lights a lamp and draws the curtains . CUSTIS stands by the door looking after LINCOLN .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>He very good man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>You 've found that out , have you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>Do you love him , you white girl ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>Of course I do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>Yes , you must .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>He 's a real white man . No offence , of course .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>Not offend . He talk to me as if black no difference .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>But I tell you what , Mr. Custis . He 'll kill himself over this war , his heart 's that kind — like a shorn lamb , as they say .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Custis</speaker>
     <p>Very unhappy war .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Susan</speaker>
     <p>But I suppose he 's right . It 's got to go on till it 's settled . In the street below a body of people is heard approaching , singing “ John Brown 's Body ” CUSTIS and SUSAN stand listening , SUSAN joining in the song as it passes and fades away . THE CURTAIN FALLS .</p>

    <head type="scene">SCENE IV .</head>
    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>About the same date . A meeting of the Cabinet at Washington . SMITH has gone and CAMERON has been replaced by EDWIN M. STANTON , Secretary of War . Otherwise the ministry , completed by SEWARD , CHASE , HOOK , BLAIR , and WELLES , is as before . They are now arranging themselves at the table , leaving LINCOLN 'S place empty .</stage>
     <stage>Seward ( coming in ): I 've just had my summons . Is there some special news ?</stage>
    </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stanton</speaker>
     <p>Yes . McClellan has defeated Lee at Antietam . It 's our greatest success . They ought not to recover from it . The tide is turning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Blair</speaker>
     <p>Have you seen the President ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stanton</speaker>
     <p>I 've just been with him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Welles</speaker>
     <p>What does he say ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stanton</speaker>
     <p>He only said , “ At last . ” He 's coming directly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>He will bring up his proclamation again . In my opinion it is inopportune .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>Well , we 've learnt by now that the President is the best man among us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>There 's a good deal of feeling against him everywhere , I find .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Blair</speaker>
     <p>He 's the one man with character enough for this business .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>There are other opinions .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>Yes , but not here , surely .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>It 's not for me to say . But I ask you , what does he mean about emancipation ? I 've always understood that it was the Union we were fighting for , and that abolition was to be kept in our minds for legislation at the right moment . And now one day he talks as though emancipation were his only concern , and the next as though he would throw up the whole idea , if by doing it he could secure peace with the establishment of the Union . Where are we ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>No , you 're wrong . It 's the Union first now with him , but there 's no question about his views on slavery . You know that perfectly well . But he has always kept his policy about slavery free in his mind , to be directed as he thought best for the sake of the Union . You remember his words : “ If I could save the Union without freeing any slaves , I would do it ; and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves , I would do it ; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone , I would also do that . My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union . ” Nothing could be plainer than that , just as nothing could be plainer than his determination to free the slaves when he can .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>Well , there are some who would have acted differently .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Blair</speaker>
     <p>And you may depend upon it they would not have acted so wisely .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stanton</speaker>
     <p>I do n't altogether agree with the President . But he 's the only man I should agree with at all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>To issue the proclamation now , and that 's what he will propose , mark my words , will be to confuse the public mind just when we want to keep it clear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Welles</speaker>
     <p>Are you sure he will propose to issue it now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>You see if he does n't .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Welles</speaker>
     <p>If he does I shall support him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>Is Lee 's army broken ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stanton</speaker>
     <p>Not yet — but it is in grave danger .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>Why does n't the President come ? One would think this news was nothing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Chase</speaker>
     <p>I must say I 'm anxious to know what he has to say about it all . A CLERK comes in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Clerk</speaker>
     <p>The President 's compliments , and he will be here in a moment . He goes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>I shall oppose it if it comes up .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Chase</speaker>
     <p>He may say nothing about it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>I think he will .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stanton</speaker>
     <p>Anyhow , it 's the critical moment .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Blair</speaker>
     <p>Here he comes . LINCOLN comes in carrying a small book .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Good-morning , gentlemen . He takes his place .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>The Ministers</speaker>
     <p>Good-morning , Mr. President .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>Great news , we hear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>If we leave things with the army to take their course for a little now , we ought to see through our difficulties .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>It 's an exciting morning , gentlemen . I feel rather excited myself . I find my mind not at its best in excitement . Will you allow me ? Opening his book . It may compose us all . It is Mr. Artemus Ward 's latest . THE MINISTERS , with the exception of HOOK , who makes no attempt to hide his irritation , and STANTON , who would do the same but for his disapproval of HOOK , listen with good-humoured patience and amusement while he reads the following passage from Artemus Ward . “ High Handed Outrage at Utica . ” “ In the Faul of 1856 , I showed my show in Utiky , a trooly grate city in the State of New York . The people gave me a cordyal recepshun . The press was loud in her prases . 1 day as I was givin a descripshun of my Beests and Snaiks in my usual flowry stile what was my skorn and disgust to see a big burly feller walk up to the cage containin my wax figgers of the Lord 's last Supper , and cease Judas Iscarrot by the feet and drag him out on the ground . He then commenced fur to pound him as hard as he cood . ” “ ‘ What under the son are you abowt , ’ cried I . ” “ Sez he , ‘ What did you bring this pussylanermus cuss here fur ? ’ and he hit the wax figger another tremenjis blow on the bed . ” “ Sez I , ‘ You egrejus ass , that airs a wax figger — a representashun of the false ‘ Postle . ’ ” “ Sez he , ‘ That 's all very well fur you to say ; but I tell you , old man , that Judas Iscarrot can n't show himself in Utiky with impunerty by a darn site , ’ with which observashun he kaved in Judassis hed . The young man belonged to 1 of the first famerlies in Utiky . I sood him , and the Joory brawt in a verdick of Arson in the 3d degree . ”</p>

     <p>May we now consider affairs of state ?</p>

     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>Yes , we may .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Hook says , yes , we may .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stanton</speaker>
     <p>Thank you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Oh , no . Thank Mr. Hook .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>Seward</speaker>
     <p>McClellan is in pursuit of Lee , I suppose .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>You suppose a good deal . But for the first time McClellan has the chance of being in pursuit of Lee , and that 's the first sign of their end . If McClellan does n't take his chance , we 'll move Grant down to the job . That will mean delay , but no matter . The mastery has changed hands .</p>

     <p>Grant drinks .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Then tell me the name of his brand . I 'll send some barrels to the others . He wins victories .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>Is there other business ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>There is . Some weeks ago I showed you a draft I made proclaiming freedom for all slaves . Hook<stage>aside to Welles</stage>I told you so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>You thought then it was not the time to issue it . I agreed . I think the moment has come . May I read it to you again ? “ It is proclaimed that on the first day of January in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three , all persons held as slaves within any state , the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States , shall be then , thenceforward , and forever free . ” That allows three months from to-day . There are clauses dealing with compensation in a separate draft .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>I must oppose the issue of such a proclamation at this moment in the most unqualified terms . This question should be left until our victory is complete . To thrust it forward now would be to invite dissension when we most need unity .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Welles</speaker>
     <p>I do not quite understand , Mr. President , why you think this the precise moment .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Believe me , gentlemen , I have considered this matter with all the earnestness and understanding of which I am capable .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>But when the “ New York Tribune ” urged you to come forward with a clear declaration six months ago , you rebuked them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Because I thought the occasion not the right one . It was useless to issue a proclamation that might be as inoperative as the Pope 's bull against the comet . My duty , it has seemed to me , has been to be loyal to a principle , and not to betray it by expressing it in action at the wrong time . That is what I conceive statesmanship to be . For long now I have had two fixed resolves . To preserve the Union , and to abolish slavery . How to preserve the Union I was always clear , and more than two years of bitterness have not dulled my vision . We have fought for the Union , and we are now winning for the Union . When and how to proclaim abolition I have all this time been uncertain . I am uncertain no longer . A few weeks ago I saw that , too , clearly . So soon , I said to myself , as the rebel army shall be driven out of Maryland , and it becomes plain to the world that victory is assured to us in the end , the time will have come to announce that with that victory and a vindicated Union will come abolition . I made the promise to myself — and to my Maker . The rebel army is now driven out , and I am going to fulfil that promise . I do not wish your advice about the main matter , for that I have determined for myself . This I say without intending anything but respect for any one of you . But I beg you to stand with me in this thing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>In my opinion , it 's altogether too impetuous .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>One other observation I will make . I know very well that others might in this matter , as in others , do better than I can , and if I was satisfied that the public confidence was more fully possessed by any one of them than by me , and knew of any constitutional way in which he could be put in my place , he should have it . I would gladly yield it to him . But , though I cannot claim undivided confidence , I do not know that , all things considered , any other person has more ; and , however this may be , there is no way in which I can have any other man put where I am . I am here ; I must do the best I can , and bear the responsibility of taking the course which I feel I ought to take .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Stanton</speaker>
     <p>Could this be left over a short time for consideration ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Chase</speaker>
     <p>I feel that we should remember that our only public cause at the moment is the preservation of the Union .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>I entirely agree .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Gentlemen , we cannot escape history . We of this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves . No personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us . In giving freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the free . We shall nobly save or meanly lose the last , best hope on earth . He places the proclamation in front of him . “ Shall be thenceforward and forever free . ” Gentlemen , I pray for your support . He signs it . THE MINISTERS rise . SEWARD , WELLES , and BLAIR shake LINCOLN 'S hand and go out . STANTON and CHASE bow to him , and follow . HOOK , the last to rise , moves away , making no sign .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Hook .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>Yes , Mr. President .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Hook , one cannot help hearing things .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>I beg your pardon ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Hook , there 's a way some people have , when a man says a disagreeable thing , of asking him to repeat it , hoping to embarrass him . It 's often effective . But I 'm not easily embarrassed . I said one cannot help hearing things .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>And I do not understand what you mean , Mr. President .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>: Come , Hook , we 're alone . Lincoln is a good enough name . And</l>
      <l>I think you understand .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>How should I ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Then , plainly , there are intrigues going on .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>Against the government ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>No . In it . Against me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>Criticism , perhaps .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>To what end ? To better my ways ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>I presume that might be the purpose .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Then , why am I not told what it is ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>I imagine it 's a natural compunction .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Or ambition ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>What do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>You think you ought to be in my place .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>You are well informed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>You cannot imagine why every one does not see that you ought to be in my place .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>By what right do you say that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Is it not true ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>You take me unprepared . You have me at a disadvantage .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>You speak as a very scrupulous man , Hook .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>Do you question my honour ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>As you will .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>Then I resign .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>As a protest against ...?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>Your suspicion .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>It is false ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>Very well , I will be frank . I mistrust your judgment .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>In what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>Generally . You over-emphasise abolition .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>You do n't mean that . You mean that you fear possible public feeling against abolition .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>It must be persuaded , not forced .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>All the most worthy elements in it are persuaded . But the ungenerous elements make the most noise , and you hear them only . You will run from the terrible name of Abolitionist even when it is pronounced by worthless creatures whom you know you have every reason to despise .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>You have , in my opinion , failed in necessary firmness in saying what will be the individual penalties of rebellion .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>This is a war . I will not allow it to become a blood-feud .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>We are fighting treason . We must meet it with severity .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>We will defeat treason . And I will meet it with conciliation .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>It is a policy of weakness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>It is a policy of faith — it is a policy of compassion .<stage>Warmly .</stage>Hook , why do you plague me with these jealousies ? Once before I found a member of my Cabinet working behind my back . But he was disinterested , and he made amends nobly . But , Hook , you have allowed the burden of these days to sour you . I know it all . I 've watched you plotting and plotting for authority . And I , who am a lonely man , have been sick at heart . So great is the task God has given to my hand , and so few are my days , and my deepest hunger is always for loyalty in my own house . You have withheld it from me . You have done great service in your office , but you have grown envious . Now you resign , as you did once before when I came openly to you in friendship . And you think that again I shall flatter you and coax you to stay . I do n't think I ought to do it . I will not do it . I must take you at your word .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>I am content . He turns to go .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Will you shake hands ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hook</speaker>
     <p>I beg you will excuse me .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes . LINCOLN stands silently for a moment , a travelled , lonely captain . He rings a bell , and a CLERK comes in .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Ask Mr. Hay to come in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Clerk</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes . LINCOLN , from the folds of his pockets , produces another book , and holds it unopened . HAY comes in .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>I 'm rather tired to-day , Hay . Read to me a little .<stage>He hands him the book .</stage>“ The Tempest ” — you know the passage . Hay<stage>reading</stage>Our revels now are ended ; these our actors , As I foretold you , were all spirits , and Are melted into air , into thin air ; And , like the baseless fabric of this vision , The cloud-capp 'd towers , the gorgeous palaces , The solemn temples , the great globe itself , Yea , all which it inherit , shall dissolve And , like this insubstantial pageant faded , Leave not a rack behind . We are such stuff As dreams are made on , and our little life Is rounded with a sleep .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>We are such stuff As dreams are made on , and our little life ... THE CURTAIN FALLS .</p>

    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>An April evening in 1865 . A farmhouse near Appomattox . GENERAL GRANT , Commander-in-Chief , under Lincoln , of the Northern armies , is seated at a table with CAPTAIN MALINS , an aide-de-camp . He is smoking a cigar , and at intervals he replenishes his glass of whiskey . DENNIS , an orderly , sits at a table in the corner , writing .</stage>
     <stage>Grant ( consulting a large watch lying in front of him ): An hour and a half . There ought to be something more from Meade by now . Dennis .</stage>
     <stage>Dennis ( coming to the table ): Yes , sir .</stage>
    </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Grant</speaker>
     <p>Take these papers to Captain Templeman , and ask Colonel West if the twenty-third are in action yet . Tell the cook to send some soup at ten o'clock . Say it was cold yesterday .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dennis</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir . He goes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Grant</speaker>
     <p>Give me that map , Malins . MALINS hands him the map at which he is working .<stage>After studying it in silence</stage>Yes . There 's no doubt about it . Unless Meade goes to sleep it can only be a question of hours . Lee 's a great man , but he can n't get out of that . Making a ring on the map with his finger . Malins<stage>taking the map again</stage>This ought to be the end , sir .</p>

     <p>Yes . If Lee surrenders , we can all pack up for home .</p>

     <p>You 're quite right , Malins . My boy goes away to school next week . Now I may be able to go down with him and see him settled . DENNIS comes back .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dennis</speaker>
     <p>Colonel West says , yes , sir , for the last half-hour . The cook says he 's sorry , sir . It was a mistake .</p>

     <p>Tell him to keep his mistakes in the kitchen .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Malins</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir . Another ORDERLY comes in .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Orderly</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Lincoln has just arrived , sir . He 's in the yard now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Grant</speaker>
     <p>All right , I 'll come . THE ORDERLY goes . GRANT rises and crosses to the door , but is met there by LINCOLN and HAY . LINCOLN , in top boots and tall hat that has seen many campaigns , shakes hands with GRANT and takes MALINS 'S salute .</p>

     <speaker>Grant</speaker>
     <p>I was n't expecting you , sir .</p>

     <p>No ; but I could n't keep away . How 's it going ? They sit .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Grant</speaker>
     <p>Meade sent word an hour and a half ago that Lee was surrounded all but two miles , which was closing in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>That ought about to settle it , eh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Grant</speaker>
     <p>Unless anything goes wrong in those two miles , sir . I 'm expecting a further report from Meade every minute .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Would there be more fighting ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Grant</speaker>
     <p>It will probably mean fighting through the night , more or less . But Lee must realise it 's hopeless by the morning . An Orderly<stage>entering</stage>A despatch , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Grant</speaker>
     <p>Yes . THE ORDERLY goes , and a YOUNG OFFICER comes in from the field . He salutes and hands a despatch to GRANT .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Officer</speaker>
     <p>From General Meade , sir . Grant<stage>taking it</stage>Thank you . He opens it and reads . You need n't wait . THE OFFICER salutes and goes . Yes , they 've closed the ring . Meade gives them ten hours . It 's timed at eight . That 's six o'clock in the morning . He hands the despatch to LINCOLN .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Malins</speaker>
     <p>He had just done a heavy march , sir , and volunteered for double guard duty to relieve a sick friend . He was found asleep at his post . He shuts the book .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Grant</speaker>
     <p>I was anxious to spare him . But it could n't be done . It was a critical place , at a gravely critical time .</p>

     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Will you , Hay ?</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Enoch White — he was sick , sir . We come from the same place .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Where 's that ?</p>
    </sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Scott</speaker>
     <p>For God 's sake , do n't , sir .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>There , there , my boy . You 're not going to be shot . Scott<stage>after a pause</stage>Not going to be shot , sir .</p>

     <p>No , no .</p>

     <p>Not — going — to — be — shot . He breaks down , sobbing . Lincoln<stage>rising and going to him</stage>There , there . I believe you when you tell me that you could n't keep awake . I 'm going to trust you , and send you back to your regiment . He goes back to his seat .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Scott</speaker>
     <p>When may I go back , sir ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>You can go back to-morrow . I expect the fighting will be over , though .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Scott</speaker>
     <p>Is it over yet , sir ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>Not quite .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Scott</speaker>
     <p>Please , sir , let me go back to-night — let me go back to-night .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Very well . He writes . Do you know where General Meade is ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Scott</speaker>
     <p>No , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Ask one of those men to come here . SCOTT calls one of his guards in .</p>

      <l>: Your prisoner is discharged . Take him at once to General</l>

     <p>Yes , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Scott</speaker>
     <p>Thank you , sir . He salutes and goes out with the SOLDIER .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Hay . Hay<stage>outside</stage>Yes , sir . He comes in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>What 's the time ? Hay<stage>looking at the watch on the table</stage>Just on half-past nine , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>I shall sleep here for a little . You 'd better shake down too . They 'll wake us if there 's any news . LINCOLN wraps himself up on two chairs . HAY follows suit on a bench . After a few moments GRANT comes to the door , sees what has happened , blows out the candles quietly , and goes away . THE CURTAIN FALLS . The First Chronicler : Under the stars an end is made , And on the field the Southern blade Lies broken , And , where strife was , shall union be , And , where was bondage , liberty . The word is spoken .... Night passes . The Curtain rises on the same scene , LINCOLN and HAY still lying asleep . The light of dawn fills the room . The ORDERLY comes in with two smoking cups of coffee and some biscuits . LINCOLN wakes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Good-morning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Orderly</speaker>
     <p>Good-morning , sir . Lincoln<stage>taking coffee and biscuits</stage>Thank you . The ORDERLY turns to HAY , who sleeps on , and he hesitates .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Hay .<stage>Shouting .</stage>Hay . Hay<stage>starting up</stage>Hullo ! What the devil is it ? I beg your pardon , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Not at all . Take a little coffee .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hay</speaker>
     <p>Thank you , sir . He takes coffee and biscuits . The ORDERLY goes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Slept well , Hay ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hay</speaker>
     <p>I feel a little crumpled , sir . I think I fell off once .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>What 's the time ? Hay<stage>looking at the watch</stage>Six o'clock , sir . GRANT comes in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Grant</speaker>
     <p>Good-morning , sir ; good-morning , Hay .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Good-morning , general .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hay</speaker>
     <p>Good-morning , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Grant</speaker>
     <p>I did n't disturb you last night . A message has just come from Meade . Lee asked for an armistice at four o'clock . Lincoln<stage>after a silence</stage>For four years life has been but the hope of this moment . It is strange how simple it is when it comes . Grant , you 've served the country very truly . And you 've made my work possible . He takes his hand . Thank you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Grant</speaker>
     <p>Had I failed , the fault would not have been yours , sir . I succeeded because you believed in me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Where is Lee ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Grant</speaker>
     <p>He 's coming here . Meade should arrive directly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Where will Lee wait ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Grant</speaker>
     <p>There 's a room ready for him . Will you receive him , sir ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>No , no , Grant . That 's your affair . You are to mention no political matters . Be generous . But I need n't say that . Grant<stage>taking a paper from his pocket</stage>Those are the terms I suggest . Lincoln<stage>reading</stage>Yes , yes . They do you honour . He places the paper on the table . An ORDERLY comes in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Orderly</speaker>
     <p>General Meade is here , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Grant</speaker>
     <p>Ask him to come here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Orderly</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir . He goes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Grant</speaker>
     <p>I learnt a good deal from Robert Lee in early days . He 's a better man than most of us . This business will go pretty near the heart , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>I 'm glad it 's to be done by a brave gentleman , Grant . GENERAL MEADE and CAPTAIN SONE , his aide-de-camp , come in . MEADE salutes . Lincoln : Congratulations , Meade . You 've done well .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Meade</speaker>
     <p>Thank you , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Grant</speaker>
     <p>Was there much more fighting ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Meade</speaker>
     <p>Pretty hot for an hour or two .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Grant</speaker>
     <p>How long will Lee be ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Meade</speaker>
     <p>Only a few minutes , I should say , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Grant</speaker>
     <p>You said nothing about terms ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Meade</speaker>
     <p>No , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Did a boy Scott come to you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Meade</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir . He went into action at once . He was killed , was n't he , Sone ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Sone</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>Killed ? It 's a queer world , Grant .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Meade</speaker>
     <p>Is there any proclamation to be made , sir , about the rebels ? Grant : I —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>No , no . I 'll have nothing of hanging or shooting these men , even the worst of them . Frighten them out of the country , open the gates , let down the bars , scare them off . Shoo ! He flings out his arms . Good-bye , Grant . Report at Washington as soon as you can . He shakes hands with him . Good-bye , gentlemen . Come along , Hay . MEADE salutes and LINCOLN goes , followed by HAY .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Grant</speaker>
     <p>Who is with Lee ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Meade</speaker>
     <p>Only one of his staff , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Grant</speaker>
     <p>You might see Malins , will you , Sone , and let us know directly General Lee comes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Sone</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir . He goes out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Grant</speaker>
     <p>Well , Meade , it 's been a big job .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Meade</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Grant</speaker>
     <p>We 've had courage and determination . And we 've had wits , to beat a great soldier . I 'd say that to any man . But it 's Abraham Lincoln , Meade , who has kept us a great cause clean to fight for . It does a man 's heart good to know he 's given victory to such a man to handle . A glass , Meade ?<stage>Pouring out whiskey .</stage>No ?<stage>Drinking .</stage>Do you know , Meade , there were fools who wanted me to oppose Lincoln for the next Presidency . I 've got my vanities , but I know better than that . MALINS comes in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Malins</speaker>
     <p>General Lee is here , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Grant</speaker>
     <p>Meade , will General Lee do me the honour of meeting me here ? MEADE salutes and goes . Where the deuce is my hat , Malins ? And sword .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Malins</speaker>
     <p>Here , sir . MALINS gets them for him . MEADE and SONE come in , and stand by the door at attention . ROBERT LEE , General-in-Chief of the Confederate forces , comes in , followed by one of his staff . The days of critical anxiety through which he has just lived have marked themselves on LEE 'S face , but his groomed and punctilious toilet contrasts pointedly with GRANT 'S unconsidered appearance . The two commanders face each other . GRANT salutes , and LEE replies .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Grant</speaker>
     <p>Sir , you have given me occasion to be proud of my opponent .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lee</speaker>
     <p>I have not spared my strength . I acknowledge its defeat .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Grant</speaker>
     <p>You have come —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lee</speaker>
     <p>To ask upon what terms you will accept surrender . Yes . Grant<stage>taking the paper from the table and handing it to LEE</stage>They are simple . I hope you will not find them ungenerous . Lee<stage>having read the terms</stage>You are magnanimous , sir . May I make one submission ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Grant</speaker>
     <p>It would be a privilege if I could consider it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lee</speaker>
     <p>You allow our officers to keep their horses . That is gracious . Our cavalry troopers ’ horses also are their own .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Grant</speaker>
     <p>I understand . They will be needed on the farms . It shall be done .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lee</speaker>
     <p>I thank you . It will do much towards conciliating our people . I accept your terms . LEE unbuckles his sword , and offers it to GRANT .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Grant</speaker>
     <p>No , no . I should have included that . It has but one rightful place . I beg you . LEE replaces his sword . GRANT offers his hand and LEE takes it . They salute , and LEE turns to go . THE CURTAIN FALLS . The two Chroniclers : A wind blows in the night , And the pride of the rose is gone . It laboured , and was delight , And rains fell , and shone Suns of the summer days , And dews washed the bud , And thanksgiving and praise Was the rose in our blood . And out of the night it came , A wind , and the rose fell , Shattered its heart of flame , And how shall June tell The glory that went with May ? How shall the full year keep The beauty that ere its day Was blasted into sleep ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Roses . Oh , heart of man</speaker>

      <l>:</l>
      <l>Courage , that in the prime</l>
      <l>Looked on truth , and began</l>
      <l>Conspiracies with time</l>
      <l>To flower upon the pain</l>
      <l>Of dark and envious earth ....</l>
      <l>A wind blows , and the brain</l>
      <l>Is the dust that was its birth .</l>
      <l>What shall the witness cry ,</l>
      <l>He who has seen alone</l>
      <l>With imagination 's eye</l>
      <l>The darkness overthrown ?</l>
      <l>Hark : from the long eclipse</l>
      <l>The wise words come —</l>

    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>The evening of April 14 , 1865 . The small lounge of a theatre . On the far side are the doors of three private boxes . There is silence for a few moments . Then the sound of applause comes from the auditorium beyond . The box doors are opened . In the centre box can be seen LINCOLN and STANTON , MRS. LINCOLN , another lady , and an officer , talking together .</stage>
     <stage>The occupants come out from the other boxes into the lounge , where small knots of people have gathered from different directions , and stand or sit talking busily .</stage>
    </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>A Lady</speaker>
     <p>Very amusing , do n't you think ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Her Companion</speaker>
     <p>Oh , yes . But it 's hardly true to life , is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Another Lady</speaker>
     <p>Is n't that dark girl clever ? What 's her name ? A Gentleman<stage>consulting his programme :</stage>Eleanor Crowne .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Another Gentleman</speaker>
     <p>There 's a terrible draught , is n't there ? I shall have a stiff neck .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>His Wife</speaker>
     <p>You should keep your scarf on .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>The Gentleman</speaker>
     <p>It looks so odd .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Another Lady</speaker>
     <p>The President looks very happy this evening , does n't he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Another</speaker>
     <p>No wonder , is it ? He must be a proud man . A young man , dressed in black , passes among the people , glancing furtively into LINCOLN 'S box , and disappears . It is JOHN WILKES BOOTH . A Lady<stage>greeting another</stage>Ah , Mrs. Bennington . When do you expect your husband back ? They drift away . SUSAN , carrying cloaks and wraps , comes in . She goes to the box , and speaks to MRS. LINCOLN . Then she comes away , and sits down apart from the crowd to wait . A Young Man : I rather think of going on the stage myself . My friends tell me I 'm uncommon good . Only I do n't think my health would stand it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>A Girl</speaker>
     <p>Oh , it must be a very easy life . Just acting — that 's easy enough . A cry of “ Lincoln ” comes through the auditorium . It is taken up , with shouts of “ The President , ” “ Speech , ” “ Abraham Lincoln , ” “ Father Abraham , ” and so on . The conversation in the lounge stops as the talkers turn to listen . After a few moments , LINCOLN is seen to rise . There is a burst of cheering . The people in the lounge stand round the box door . LINCOLN holds up his hand , and there is a sudden silence .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lincoln</speaker>
     <p>My friends , I am touched , deeply touched , by this mark of your good-will . After four dark and difficult years , we have achieved the great purpose for which we set out . General Lee 's surrender to General Grant leaves but one Confederate force in the field , and the end is immediate and certain .<stage>Cheers .</stage>I have but little to say at this moment . I claim not to have controlled events , but confess plainly that events have controlled me . But as events have come before me , I have seen them always with one faith . We have preserved the American Union , and we have abolished a great wrong .<stage>Cheers .</stage>The task of reconciliation , of setting order where there is now confusion , of bringing about a settlement at once just and merciful , and of directing the life of a reunited country into prosperous channels of good-will and generosity , will demand all our wisdom , all our loyalty . It is the proudest hope of my life that I may be of some service in this work .<stage>Cheers .</stage>Whatever it may be , it can be but little in return for all the kindness and forbearance that I have received . With malice toward none , with charity for all , it is for us to resolve that this nation , under God , shall have a new birth of freedom ; and that government of the people , by the people , for the people , shall not perish from the earth . There is a great sound of cheering . It dies down , and a boy passes through the lounge and calls out “ Last act , ladies and gentlemen . ” The people disperse , and the box doors are closed . SUSAN is left alone and there is silence . After a few moments , BOOTH appears . He watches SUSAN and sees that her gaze is fixed away from him . He creeps along to the centre box and disengages a hand from under his cloak . It holds a revolver . Poising himself , he opens the door with a swift movement , fires , flings the door to again , and rushes away . The door is thrown open again , and the OFFICER follows in pursuit . Inside the box , MRS. LINCOLN is kneeling by her husband , who is supported by STANTON . A DOCTOR runs across the lounge and goes into the box . There is complete silence in the theatre . The door closes again . Susan<stage>who has run to the box door , and is kneeling there , sobbing</stage>Master , master ! No , no , not my master ! The other box doors have opened , and the occupants with others have collected in little terror-struck groups in the lounge . Then the centre door opens , and STANTON comes out , closing it behind him .</p>

     <p>Events go by . And upon circumstance Disaster strikes with the blind sweep of chance . And this our mimic action was a theme , Kinsmen , as life is , clouded as a dream .</p>

     <p>But , as we spoke , presiding everywhere Upon event was one man 's character . And that endures ; it is the token sent Always to man for man 's own government . THE CURTAIN FALLS .</p>
