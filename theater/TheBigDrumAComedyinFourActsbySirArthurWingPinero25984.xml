    <head>PREFACE</head>
    <p n="1">The Big Drum is published exactly as it was written , and as it was originally performed . At its first representation , however , the audience was reported to have been saddened by its “ unhappy ending . ” Pressure was forthwith put upon me to reconcile Philip and Ottoline at the finish , and at the third performance of the play the curtain fell upon the picture , violently and crudely brought about , of Ottoline in Philip 's arms .</p>
    <p n="2">I made the alteration against my principles and against my conscience , and yet not altogether unwillingly . For we live in depressing times ; and perhaps in such times it is the first duty of a writer for the stage to make concessions to his audiences and , above everything , to try to afford them a complete , if brief , distraction from the gloom which awaits them outside the theatre .</p>
    <p n="3">My excuse for having at the start provided an “ unhappy ” ending is that I was blind enough not to regard the ultimate break between Philip and Ottoline as really unhappy for either party . On the contrary , I looked upon the separation of these two people as a fortunate occurrence for both ; and I conceived it as a piece of ironic comedy which might not prove unentertaining that the falling away of Philip from his high resolves was checked by the woman he had once despised and who had at last grown to know and to despise herself .</p>
   </div>
   <titlePage>
    <docImprint>But comedy of this order has a knack of cutting rather deeply , of ceasing , in some minds , to be comedy at all ; and it may be said that this is what has happened in the present instance . Luckily it is equally true that certain matters are less painful , because less actual , in print than upon the stage . The “ wicked publisher , ” therefore , even when bombs are dropping round him , can afford to be more independent than the theatrical manager ; and for this reason I have not hesitated to ask my friend Mr. Heinemann to publish THE BIG DRUM in its original form .

     <speaker>THE BIG DRUM</speaker>
     <p>THE FIRST ACT The scene is a room , elegantly decorated , in a flat in South Audley Street . On the right , two windows give a view , through muslin curtains , of the opposite houses . In the wall facing the spectator are two doors , one on the right , the other on the left . The left-hand door opens into the room from a dimly-lighted corridor , the door on the right from the dining-room . Between the doors there is a handsome fireplace . No fire is burning and the grate is banked with flowers . When the dining-room door is opened , a sideboard and a side-table are seen in the further room , upon which are dishes of fruit , an array of ice-plates and finger-bowls , liqueurs in decanters , glasses , silver , etc . The pictures , the ornaments upon the mantelpiece , and the articles of furniture are few but choice . A high-backed settee stands on the right of the fireplace ; near the settee is a fauteuil-stool ; facing the settee is a Charles II arm-chair . On the left of the room there is a small table with a chair beside it ; on the right , not far from the nearer window , are a writing-table and writing-chair . Pieces of bric-à-brac lie upon the tables , where there are also some graceful statuettes in ivory and bronze . Another high-backed settee fills the space between the windows , and in each window there is an arm-chair of the same period as the one at the fireplace . The street is full of sunlight .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Note : Throughout , “ right ” and “ left ” are the spectators ’ right and left , not the actor 's .</stage>
    <stage>ROBERT ROOPE , seated at the writing-table , is sealing a letter . NOYES enters at the door on the left , followed by PHILIP MACKWORTH .</stage>

    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>A triumph , to have dragged you out !<stage>Looking at his watch .</stage>Luncheon is n't till a quarter-to-two . I asked you for half-past-one because I want to have a quiet little jaw with you beforehand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Delightful .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>Er — I 'd better tell you at once , old chap , whom you 'll meet here to-day .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Aha ! Your tone presages a most distinguished guest .<stage>Seating himself in the chair by the small table .</stage>Is she a grande-duchesse , or is he a crowned head ?</p>

     <p>Pouah !<stage>Leaning back in his chair , his legs outstretched , and spouting .</stage>“ Mrs. Trevelyan Potter , wearing a gown of yellow charmeuse exquisitely draped with chiffon , gave a dance for her niece Miss Hermione Stubbs at the Ritz Hotel last night . ” That sort o ’ stuff !</p>
    </sp>

     <p><stage>Ruefully .</stage>You do n't grow a bit more reasonable , Phil ; not a bit .</p>

     <p>I beg pardon . Go ahead .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>That 's five , as you justly observe .<stage>Clearing his throat .</stage>H 'm ! H 'm !</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>The sixth ? I prepare myself for your great effect .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hastily .</stage>She has got rid of her house in Paris and rejoined her people . She 's with them in Ennismore Gardens .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Thank you , I 'm aware of it . One reads of Ottoline 's movements in every rag one picks up .<stage>Walking over to the right .</stage>She 's the biggest chasseuse of the crowd .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>I assure you she appears very much altered .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>What , can the leopard change his spots !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>Her family may still bang the big drum occasionally , and give it an extra whack on her account ; but Ottoline herself ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Faugh !<stage>Returning to ROOPE .</stage>Why the devil have you done this ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Feebly .</stage>I confess , in the hope of bringing about a reconciliation .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>You — you good-natured old meddler .<stage>Quickly .</stage>Does she expect to find me here ?</p>

     <p><stage>Rising and seizing him .</stage>You shall do nothing of the kind .<stage>Forcing him down upon the fauteuil-stool .</stage>You 'll upset my luncheon-table !<stage>Tidying himself .</stage>You 're most inconsiderate ; you are positively . And you 've disarranged my necktie .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a low voice .</stage>How is she looking , Robbie ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>Brilliant .<stage>Putting his necktie in order .</stage>Is that straight ? Brilliant .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gazing into space .</stage>Ten years ago , old man !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>Quite .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>It was at her father and mother 's , in Paris , that I made your acquaintance . Recollect ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>Perfectly ; in the Avenue Montaigne . I had a flat in the Palais-Royal at the time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Scornfully .</stage>You were one of the smart set . It was worth their while to get hold of you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>My dear Phil , do be moderately fair . You were n't in the smart set .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>No ; I was trying my hand at journalism in those days . Dreadful trade ! I was Paris correspondent to the Whitehall Gazette . That 's why I was favoured .<stage>Abruptly .</stage>Robbie ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>Hey ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>You 'll scarcely credit it . One evening , while I was at work , Ottoline turned up with her maid at my lodgings in the Rue Soufflot , sent the maid out of the room , and proposed that I should “ mention ” her family in my letters to the Whitehall .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>Mention them ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Drag in allusions to ‘ em constantly — their entertainments and so forth ; boom them , in fact .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>Was that the cause of the — the final ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Nodding .</stage>Yes . The following week her engagement to de Chaumié was announced .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>After a slight pause .</stage>Well , in spite of all this , I 'm convinced she was genuinely attached to you , Phil — as fond of you as you were of her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Resting his head on his hands .</stage>Oh , shut up !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>Anyhow , here 's an opportunity of testing it , dear excellent friend . She 's been a widow twelve months ; you need have no delicacy on that score .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking up .</stage>Why , do you suggest ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>Certainly ; and without delay . I hear there 's a shoal of men after her , including Tim Barradell .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a grim smile .</stage>“ Bacon ” Barradell ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Assentingly .</stage>They say Sir Timothy 's in constant attendance .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>And what chance , do you imagine , would a poor literary cove stand against a real live baronet — and the largest bacon-curer in Ireland ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rubbing his chin .</stage>You never know . Women are romantic creatures . She might prefer the author of those absorbing works of fiction whose pages often wrap up Tim Barradell 's rashers .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rising .</stage>Ha , ha , ha !<stage>Giving himself a shake .</stage>Even so it can n't be done , Robbie ; though I 'm grateful to you for your amiable little plot .<stage>Walking about .</stage>Heavens above , if Ottoline married me , she 'd be puffing my wares on the sly before the honeymoon was half over !</p>

     <p>And a jolly good job too .<stage>Moving to the left , peevishly .</stage>The truth is , my dear Phil , you 're a crank — an absolute crank — on the subject of the — ah — the natural desire of some people to keep themselves in the public eye . Mercy on us , if it comes to that , I 'm an advertiser !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>If it comes to that , you miserable old sinner , you are .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>I admit it , frankly . I own it gratifies me exceedingly to see my little dinner-parties and tea-parties , here or at my club , chronicled in the press . And it gratifies my friends also . Many of them would n't honour me at all if my list of guests was n't in the fashionable intelligence next morning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Oh ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , you may roar . I declare I shudder to think of the difference it ‘ ud make to me socially if I did n't advertise .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Robbie , I blush for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>Tosh ! It 's an advertising age .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Stalking to the fireplace .</stage>It 's a beastly vulgar age .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>It 's the age I happen to live in , and I accommodate myself to it .<stage>Pacing the room as he warms to his theme .</stage>And if it 's necessary for a private individual such as myself to advertise , as I maintain it is , how much more necessary is it for you to do so — a novelist , a poet , a would-be playwright , a man with something to sell ! Dash it , they 've got to advertise soap , and soap 's essential ! Why not literature , which is n't ? And yet you wo n't find the name of Mr. Philip Mackworth in the papers from one year 's end to another , except in a scrubby criticism now and again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Calmly .</stage>Excuse me , there are the publisher 's announcements .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>Publishers ’ announcements ! I 'm not speaking of the regular advertising columns . What I want to see are paragraphs concerning you mixed up with the news of the day , information about you and your habits , interviews with you , letters from you on every conceivable topic ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Grinning .</stage>Do you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Joining PHILIP .</stage>Oh , my dear Phil , I entreat you , feed the papers ! It is n't as if you had n't talent ; you have . Advertising minus talent goes a long way ; advertising plus talent is irresistible . Feed the papers . The more you do for them , the more they 'll do for you . Quid pro quo . To the advertiser shall advertisement be given . Newspaper men are the nicest chaps in the world . Feed them gratis with bright and amusin ’ “ copy , ” as you term it , and they 'll love and protect you for ever .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Not for ever , Robbie . Whom the press loves die young .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>It 's fickle , you mean — some day it 'll turn and rend you ? Perhaps . Still , if you make hay while the sun shines ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>The sun ! You do n't call that the sun !<stage>Disdainfully .</stage>P'ssh !</p>

     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Leaving him .</stage>Oh , I 've no patience with you !<stage>Spluttering .</stage>Upon my word , your hatred of publicity is — is — is — is morbid . It 's worse than morbid — it 's Victorian .<stage>Sitting in the chair by the small table .</stage>There ! I can n't say anything severer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Advancing .</stage>Yes , but wait a moment , Robbie . Who says I have a hatred of publicity ? I have n't said anything so absurd . Do n't I write for the public ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>Exactly !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Standing near ROOPE .</stage>
      <l>I have no dislike for publicity — for fame . By</l>
      <l>George , sir , I covet it , if I can win it honestly and decently !</l>

     <p><stage>Shrugging his shoulders .</stage>Ah ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>And I humble myself before the men and women of my craft — and they are many — who succeed in winning it in that fashion , or who are content to remain obscure . But for the rest — the hustlers of the pen , the seekers after mere blatant applause , the pickers-up of cheap popularity — I 've a profound contempt for them and their methods .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>You can n't deny the ability of some of ‘ em .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Deny it ! Of course I do n't deny it . But no amount of ability , of genius if you will , absolves the follower of any art from the obligation of conducting himself as a modest gentleman ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>Ah , there 's where you 're so hopelessly Victorian and out o ’ date !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Well , that 's my creed ; and , whether I 've talent or not , I 'd rather snuff out , when my time comes , neglected and a pauper than go back on it .<stage>Walking away and pacing the room .</stage>Oh , but I 'm not discouraged , my dear Robbie — not a scrap ! I 'm not discouraged , though you do regard me as a dismal failure .</p>

     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Ha , ha , ha !<stage>Taking ROOPE 's arm .</stage>Oddly enough — oddly enough , the story deals with the very subject we 've been discussing .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Without enthusiasm .</stage>Indeed ?</p>

     <p>Haw ! You only fancy you 're rushed . Your life is a rest-cure compared with mine . You 've no conception , either of you , what my days are just now .</p>

     <p>Though I was n't in bed till two this morning . At eight I had a cup of coffee and a piece of dry toast , and skimmed the papers . From eight-thirty till ten I dictated a special article on our modern English hostesses — “ The Hostesses of England : Is Hospitality Declining ? ” , a question I answer in the negative ——</p>

     <p>At ten o'clock , a man from Clapp and Beazley 's with some patterns of socks and underwear . Disposed of him , dressed , and by a quarter-to-eleven I was in the Park . Strolled up and down with Lady Ventnor and Sir Hill Birch and saw everybody there was to be seen . I nevah make a single note ; my memory 's marvellous . Left the Park at twelve and took a taxi to inquire after Lord Harrogate , Charlie Sievewright , and old Lady Dorcas Newnham . I 'm not boring you ?</p>

     <p>Lady Dorcas caught sight of me from her window and hailed me in . I sat with her for twenty minutes — “ Greenie ” she always calls me —<stage>mimicking</stage>“ Now , Greenie , what 's the noos ? ” Haw , haw , haw ! I walked away from Lady Dorcas 's , and was in Upper Grosvenor Street punctually at one .<stage>To ROOPE .</stage>There 's been a meeting at the Baroness Van der Meer 's to-day , you know , over this fête at the Albert Hall .</p>

    <sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>I had a headache — mother was so vexed with me ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. ANSLOW</speaker>
     <p>Headache or not , you looked divine .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. QUEBEC</speaker>
     <p>A vision !</p>

     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Standing near PHILIP .</stage>Madame de Chaumié ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Advancing .</stage>Yes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>Here 's an old friend of ours whom you have n't met for years — Mackworth .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She starts and then waits , rooted , for PHILIP 's approach . He replaces the figure carefully and comes to her , and their hands touch . ROOPE leaves them and engages the others in conversation .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>To PHILIP , in a low voice , her eyes sparkling .</stage>I had no idea I was to have this pleasure .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gently , but without exceeding the bounds of mere courtesy .</stage>Robbie excels in surprises ; he has been almost equally reserved with me . Are you very well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>Very . And you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Very . And Sir Randle and Lady Filson ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>Quite well — and my brother Bertram .<stage>Chilled .</stage>Perhaps you 've heard that I am making my home with them now in London , permanently — that I 've left Paris ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Robbie — and the newspapers — have told me . It 's late in the day to do it — may I offer you my sympathy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a stately inclination of the head .</stage>Thank you . And I my congratulations on your success ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quietly .</stage>Success !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Comprehending .</stage>Ah ? Le public est si bête . I 've read every line you 've written , I believe .<stage>He bows .</stage>I — I have felt proud to think that we were once — that we were once — not des inconnus .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He bows again , and there is silence between them . The dining-room door opens and NOYES presents himself . A waiter is seen in the dining-room , standing at the side table .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NOYES</speaker>
     <p><stage>To ROOPE .</stage>Lunch is served , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>To everybody .</stage>Come along ! Come along , dear excellent friends !<stage>OTTOLINE smiles graciously at PHILIP and turns from him .</stage>Lead the way , dear Mrs. Anslow . Madame de Chaumié !<stage>MRS. ANSLOW slips her arm through OTTOLINE .</stage>You both sit opposite the fireplace . Dear Mrs. Wally ! Come along , my dear Phil !<stage>Putting an arm round GREEN 's shoulder .</stage>Colly ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They all move into the dining-room , and the curtain falls . It rises again almost immediately . A chair , withdrawn from the further window , is now beside the fauteuil-stool , on its right ; and the chair which was close to the small table has been pulled out into the room , and faces the fauteuil-stool at some little distance from it . The doors are closed . MRS. ANSLOW and MRS. QUEBEC are taking their departure . The former is saying good-bye to OTTOLINE , who is standing before the fireplace ; the latter is talking to ROOPE near the door on the left . On the right is PHILIP , ready to receive his share of the adieux .</stage>

     <speaker>MRS. ANSLOW</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Shaking hands with OTTOLINE .</stage>
      <l>Good-bye . You might come on to</l>

    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>Sorry . I really am full up this afternoon .<stage>MRS. QUEBEC comes to OTTOLINE as MRS. ANSLOW goes to PHILIP . ROOPE opens the door on the left and remains there , waiting to escort the ladies to the outer door .</stage>Can I give you a lift anywhere , Esmé ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. QUEBEC</speaker>
     <p>Thanks ; Millicent 's taking me along with her to the Horse Show .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. ANSLOW</speaker>
     <p><stage>Shaking hands with PHILIP .</stage>Very pleased to meet you again . Ever see anything now of the Fairfields ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Never .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. ANSLOW</speaker>
     <p>No loss . I believe dear old Eustace is off his head .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Possibly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. ANSLOW</speaker>
     <p><stage>Tolerantly .</stage>But then , so many people are off their heads , are n't they ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>A great many .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. ANSLOW</speaker>
     <p><stage>Bestowing a parting nod upon PHILIP and crossing to the open door .</stage>Sha'n ' t wait , Esmé . It 's a month 's journey to Hammersmith in the ark .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. QUEBEC</speaker>
     <p><stage>Kissing OTTOLINE .</stage>Good-bye .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. ANSLOW</speaker>
     <p><stage>To ROOPE .</stage>Charming lunch . Enjoyed myself enormously .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. QUEBEC</speaker>
     <p><stage>Shaking hands with PHILIP hastily .</stage>Good-bye , Mr. Mackworth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Good-bye .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>ROOPE and MRS. ANSLOW have disappeared ; MRS. QUEBEC follows them . OTTOLINE approaches PHILIP slowly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Giving him her hand .</stage>Good-bye .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Bending over it formally .</stage>Good-bye .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>We — we 're in Ennismore Gardens , you know .<stage>He acknowledges the information by a stiff bow . She interests herself in her glove-buttons .</stage>You — you 've chosen to drop out of my — out of our lives so completely that I hardly like to ask you to come and see us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Constrainedly .</stage>You are very good ; but I — I do n't go about much in these days , and I 'm afraid ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quickly .</stage>Oh , I 'm sure you 're wise .<stage>Drawing herself erect .</stage>A writer should n't give up to society what is meant for mankind , should he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She passes him distantly , to leave the room , and he suddenly grips her shoulder .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Ottoline ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>By a mutual impulse , they glance swiftly at the open door , and then she throws herself into his arms .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>Philip ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Just as swiftly , they separate ; and a moment afterwards ROOPE returns , rubbing his hands cheerily .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Advancing , but not shutting the door .</stage>There ! Now we 're by ourselves !<stage>To OTTOLINE .</stage>You 're not running away ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Confused .</stage>Oh , I — I ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>It 's only half-past-three . Why do n't you and Mackworth sit down and have a little talk together ?<stage>To PHILIP , who has strolled to the further window and is looking into the street .</stage>You 're in no hurry , Phil ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Not in the least .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Crossing to the writing-table .</stage>I 'll finish answering my letters ; I sha'n ' t have a moment later on .<stage>Gathering up his correspondence .</stage>You wo n't disturb me ; I 'll polish ‘ em off in another room .<stage>To OTTOLINE .</stage>Are you goin ’ to Lady Paulton 's by-and-by , by any chance ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Again at the fireplace , her back to ROOPE and PHILIP .</stage>And Mrs. Jack Cathcart 's — and Mrs . Le Roy 's ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>You shall take me to Lowndes Square , if you will .<stage>Recrossing .</stage>Sha'n ' t be more than ten minutes .<stage>At the door .</stage>Ten minutes , dear excellent friends . A quarter-of-an-hour at the outside .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He vanishes , closing the door . There is a pause , and then PHILIP and OTTOLINE turn to one another and he goes to her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Her hands in his , breathlessly .</stage>You are glad to see me , then !<stage>Laughing shyly .</stage>Ha , ha ! You are glad !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Tenderly .</stage>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>You brute , Phil , to make me behave in such an undignified way !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>If there 's any question of dignity , what on earth has become of mine ? I was the first to break down .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>To break down ! Why should you try to treat me so freezingly ? You can n't be angry with me still , after all these years ! C'est pas possible !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>It was stupid of me to attempt to hide my feelings .<stage>Pressing her hand to his lips .</stage>But , my dear Otto — my dear girl — where 's the use of our coming into each other 's lives again ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>The use —? Why should n't we be again as we were in the old Paris days —<stage>embarrassed</stage>well , not quite , perhaps ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>Oh , of course , if you command it , I am ready to buy some smart clothes , and fish for opportunities of meeting you occasionally on a crowded staircase or in a hot supper-room . But — as for anything else ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Slowly withdrawing her hands and putting them behind her .</stage>As for — anything else ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>I repeat — cui bono ?<stage>Regarding her kindly but penetratingly .</stage>What would be the result of your reviving a friendship with an ill-tempered , intolerant person who would be just as capable to-morrow of turning upon you like a savage ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>Ah , you are still angry with me !<stage>With a change of tone .</stage>As you did that evening , for instance , when I came with Nannette to your shabby little den in the Rue Soufflot ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Precisely .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Walking away to the front of the fauteuil-stool .</stage>To beg you to prôner my father and mother in the journal you were writing for — what was the name of it ?——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Following her .</stage>The Whitehall Gazette .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>And you were polite enough to tell me that my cravings and ideals were low , pitiful , ignoble !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Regretfully .</stage>You remember ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Facing him .</stage>As clearly as you do , my friend .<stage>Laying her hand upon his arm , melting .</stage>Besides , they were true — those words — hideously true — as were many other sharp ones you shot at me in Paris .<stage>Turning from him .</stage>Low — pitiful — ignoble ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Otto ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She seats herself in the chair by the fauteuil-stool and motions him to sit by her . He does so .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , they were true ; but they are true of me no longer . I am greatly changed , Philip .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Eyeing her .</stage>You are more beautiful than ever .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>H'sh !— changed in my character , disposition , view of things . Life has gone sadly with me since we parted .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Indeed ? I — I 'm grieved .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>My marriage was an utter failure . You heard ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Shaking his head .</stage>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>No ?<stage>Smiling faintly .</stage>I thought everybody hears when a marriage is a failure .<stage>Mournfully .</stage>The fact remains ; it was a terrible mistake . Poor Lucien ! I do n't blame him for my nine years of unhappiness . I engaged myself to him in a hurry — out of pique ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Pique ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>Within a few hours of that fatal visit of mine to your lodgings .<stage>Looking at him significantly .</stage>It was that that drove me to it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Staring at her .</stage>That ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Simply .</stage>Yes , Phil .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Otto !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Plucking at the arm of her chair .</stage>You see — you see , notwithstanding the vulgarity of my mind , I had a deep respect for you . Even then there were wholesome signs in me !<stage>Shrugging her shoulders plaintively .</stage>Whether I should have ended by obeying my better instincts , and accepting you , I can n't say . I believe I should . I — I believe I should . At any rate , I had already begun to chafe under the consciousness that , while you loved me , you had no esteem for me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Remorsefully .</stage>My dear !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Raising her head .</stage>That scene between us in the Rue Soufflot set my blood on fire . To have a request refused me was sufficiently mortifying ; but to be whipped , scourged , scarified , into the bargain —! I flew down your stairs after I left you , and drove home , scorching with indignation ; and next morning I sent for Lucien — a blind adorer !— and promised to be his wife .<stage>Leaning back .</stage>Comprenez-vous , maintenant ? Solely to hurt you ; to hurt you , the one man among my acquaintances whom I — admired !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She searches for her handkerchief . He rises and goes to the mantelpiece and stares at the flowers in the grate .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Almost inaudibly .</stage>Oh , Otto !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Wiping a tear from her cheek .</stage>Heigh , dear me ! Whenever I go over the past , and that 's not seldom , I can n't help thinking you might have been a little gentler with me — a girl of three-and-twenty — and have made allowances .<stage>Blowing her nose .</stage>What was Dad before he went out to Buenos Aires with his wife and children ; only a junior partner in a small concern in the City ! Was n't it natural that , when he came back to Europe , prosperous but a nobody , he should be eager to elbow himself into a respectable social position , and that his belongings should have caught the fever ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Wretchedly .</stage>Yes — yes ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rising and wandering to the writing-table .</stage>First we descended upon Paris — you know ; but Paris did n't respond very satisfactorily . Plenty of smart men flocked round us — la belle Mademoiselle Filson drew them to the Avenue Montaigne !——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Under his breath , turning .</stage>T'scht !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>But the women were either hopelessly bourgeoises or slightly déclassée .<stage>Inspecting some of the pieces of bric-à-brac upon the table .</stage>Which decided us to attack London — and induced me to pay my call on you in the Rue Soufflot ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>I understand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>To coax you to herald us in your weekly causeries .<stage>Wincing .</stage>Horrible of me , that was ; horrible , horrible , horrible !<stage>Replacing an object upon the table and moving to the other side of the room .</stage>However , I was n't destined to share the earliest of the London triumphs .<stage>Bitterly .</stage>Mine awaited me in Paris , and at Vaudemont-Baudricourt , as the Comtesse de Chaumié !<stage>Shivering .</stage>Ugh-h-h-h ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She is about to sit in the chair on the left when he comes to her impulsively and restrains her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>My poor girl ——!</p>

     <p>It 's a relief to me to open my heart to you , Philip .<stage>He leads her to the fauteuil-stool .</stage>Robbie wo n't interrupt us yet awhile , will he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>We 'll kick him out if he does .<stage>They sit , close together , upon the fauteuil-stool .</stage>Oh , but he wo n't ! This is a deep-laid plot of the old chap 's ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>Plot ?</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>I detected it . Almost the first thing you said to me when I arrived was that you 'd been gathering news of me lately from the papers !</p>

     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gently .</stage>Forgive me .</p>

     <p>Ha !<stage>Brushing her hair from her brow fretfully .</stage>Oh ! Oh , Phil , it was blindness on my part to return to them — sheer blindness !</p>

     <p>They 've been urging me to do it ever since my husband 's death ; so I had ample time to consider the step . But I did n't realize , till I 'd settled down in Ennismore Gardens , how thoroughly I ——</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>How thoroughly I 've grown away from them — ceased to be one of them .<stage>Stamping her foot .</stage>Oh , I know I 'm ungrateful ; and that they 're proud of me , and pet and spoil me ;<stage>contracting her shoulder-blades</stage>but they make my flesh feel quite raw — mother , Dad , and my brother Bertram ! Their intense satisfaction with themselves , and everything appertaining to them , irritates me to such a pitch that I 'm often obliged to rush out of the room to stop myself from being rude .<stage>Impetuously .</stage>And then to have to watch Dad and mother still pushing , scheming , intriguing ; always with the affectation of despising réclame , yet doing nothing — not the most simple act — without a careful eye to it ! Years ago , as I 've said , there was an intelligible motive for our paltry ambitions ; but now , when they have forcé les portes and can afford to be sincere and independent ——!<stage>Checking herself .</stage>But I ought n't to speak of my folks like this , ought I , even to you whom I can trust !<stage>Penitently .</stage>It 's awfully wrong of me .

     <p><stage>After a short silence .</stage>What do you intend to do , then , Otto , ultimately — re-establish yourself in Paris ?</p>

     <p>I travelled about for some months after I became a widow , and when I saw Paris again —!<stage>Starting up as if to rid herself of disagreeable sensations .</stage>No , my one great desire is to escape from it all , Phil —<stage>moving to the chair on the left</stage>to escape ——!</p>

     <p><stage>Resting her elbow upon the arm of her chair and her chin upon her hand , musingly .</stage>Oh , I believe any world would content me that 's totally different from the world I 've lived in so long ; any world that is n't flat and stale and stifling ; that is n't made up of shams , and petty aims and appetites ; any world that — well , such a world as you used to picture , Phil , when you preached your gospel to a selfish , common girl under the chestnuts in the Allée de Longchamp and the Champs-Elysées !<stage>Half laughing , half sighing .</stage>Ha , la , la , la !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>It would enable you to come often to Ennismore Gardens , and have cosy teas with me in my room . We could n't be — what we are — on the sly indefinitely ; it 's impracticable . There 'll be a storm at first , but it will soon blow over .<stage>Making a wry face .</stage>Still , if you 'd rather ——</p>

    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>The scene is a morning-room , richly furnished and decorated , in a house in Ennismore Gardens . The walls are of panelled wood for two-thirds of their height , the rest being covered with silk . In the wall at the back , between the centre and the left-hand corner , there is a handsome double-door opening upon another door , covered in thick cloth , which is supposed to give admittance to the library . On the right , in a piece of wall running obliquely towards the spectator from the back wall to the right-hand wall , is a companion double-door to that on the left , with the difference that the panels of the upper part of this door are glazed . A silk curtain obscures the glazed panels to the height of about seven feet from the floor , and above the curtain there is a view of a spacious hall . When the glazed door is opened , it is seen that the hall is appropriately furnished . A window is at the further end of it , letting in light from the street , and on the right of the window there is a lofty screen arranged in such a manner as to suggest that it conceals the front door of the house .</stage>
     <stage>The fireplace , where a bank of flowers hides the grate , is in the left-hand wall of the room . On the further side of the fireplace there is an armchair , and before the fireplace a settee . Behind the settee , also facing the fireplace , are a writing-table and chair ; close to the further side of the writing-table is a smaller chair ; and at the nearer end of the settee , but at some distance from it , stands a low-backed arm-chair which is turned in the direction of the door on the right .</stage>
     <stage>On the other side of the room , facing the spectator and following the line of the oblique wall , is a second settee . On the left of this settee is an arm-chair , on the right a round table and another chair . Books and periodicals are strewn upon the table . Against the wall at the back , between the doors , are an oblong table and a chair ; and other articles of furniture and embellishment — cabinets of various kinds , jardinières , mirrors , lamps , etc ., etc .— occupy spaces not provided for in this description .</stage>
     <stage>Among other objects upon the oblong table are some framed photographs , conspicuously displayed , of members of the Royal Family , and a book-rack containing books of reference .</stage>
     <stage>It is daylight .</stage>
     <stage>[ MISS TRACER , a red-haired , sprightly young lady , is seated upon the settee on the right , turning the leaves of a picture-paper . A note-book , with a pencil stuck in it , lies by her side . There is a knock at the door on the left .</stage>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WESTRIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Somewhat disturbed .</stage>Strictly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS TRACER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling at him winningly and moving to the settee before the fireplace .</stage>You 're a nice boy ; I 'm sure you would n't make mischief .<stage>Sinking on to the settee with a yawn .</stage>Oh ! Oh , I 'm so weary !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WESTRIP</speaker>
     <p>Weary ? Before you 've begun your morning 's work !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS TRACER</speaker>
     <p>Before I 've begun it ! I had a parade downstairs in the servants ’ hall at a quarter-to-ten .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WESTRIP</speaker>
     <p>Parade ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS TRACER</speaker>
     <p>We 've two new women in the house who are perfect idiots . They can n't remember to say “ yes , my lady ” and “ no , my lady ” and “ very good , my lady ” whenever Lady Filson speaks to them . One of them actually addressed her yesterday as “ ma'am . ” I wonder the roof did n't fall in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WESTRIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Meditatively .</stage>I 've noticed that Sir Randle and Lady Filson have a great relish for being Sir 'd and Lady 'd .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS TRACER</speaker>
     <p>Ha , ha ! Rather !<stage>Over her shoulder .</stage>You take a friendly hint . If your predecessor had Sir Randle 'd and Lady Filson 'd them more frequently , you would n't be standing in his shoes at this moment .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WESTRIP</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>In the middle of the room , his hands in his pockets .</stage>
      <l>Why was Sir</l>
      <l>Randle knighted , do you know ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS TRACER</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Built a large drill-hall for the Territorials near his country place at</l>
      <l>Bramsfold .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WESTRIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Innocently .</stage>Oh , is he interested in the Territorials ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS TRACER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Partly raising herself .</stage>Interested in the Territorials ! How simple you are ! He cares as much for the Territorials as I care for snakes .<stage>Kneeling upon the settee and resting her arms on the back of it , talkatively .</stage>The drill-hall was her notion ; she engineered the whole affair .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WESTRIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Opening his eyes wider and wider .</stage>Lady Filson ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS TRACER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Nodding .</stage>Her maid 's my informant . A few years ago he was growing frightfully down-in-the-mouth . He fancied he 'd got stuck , as it were — that everybody was getting an honour but himself . So the blessed shanty was run up in a devil of a hurry — excuse my Greek ; and as soon as it was dry , Mrs. Filson , as she then was , wrote to some big-wig or other — without her husband 's knowledge , she explained — and called attention to the service he 'd rendered to the cause of patriotism . Lambert saw the draft of the letter on her mistress 's dressing-table .<stage>Shaking with laughter .</stage>Ho , ho , ho ! And what d'ye think ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WESTRIP</speaker>
     <p>W-well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS TRACER</speaker>
     <p>The corrections were in his handwriting !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WESTRIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Shocked .</stage>In Sir Randle 's ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS TRACER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Jumping up .</stage>Phiou ! I 'm fearfully indiscreet .<stage>Going to WESTRIP and touching his coat-sleeve .</stage>Between ourselves , Mr. Westrip !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WESTRIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Moving to the round table .</stage>Quite — quite .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS TRACER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Following him .</stage>Oh , they 're not a bad sort , by any means , if you just humour them a bit . We all have our little weaknesses , have n't we ? I 've mine , I confess .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WESTRIP</speaker>
     <p>They 've both been excessively kind to me .<stage>Turning to her .</stage>And as for Madame de Chaumié ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS TRACER</speaker>
     <p>Oh , she 's a dear — a regular dear !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WESTRIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Fervently .</stage>By Jove , is n't she !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS TRACER</speaker>
     <p>But then , my theory is that she was changed at her birth . She 's not a genuine Filson , I 'll swear .<stage>Suddenly walking away from him .</stage>H'sh !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>LADY FILSON , a handsome , complacent woman of about fifty-seven , enters from the hall .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY FILSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Who carries a hand-bag crammed with letters , cards of invitation , etc .</stage>Good morning . MISS TRACER and WESTRIP . Good morning , Lady Filson .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY FILSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Closing the door and advancing .</stage>Oh , Mr. Westrip , I wish you 'd try to find the last number of the Trifler . It must have been taken out of my bedroom by one of the servants .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WESTRIP</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Searching among the periodicals on the round table .</stage>
      <l>Certainly , Lady</l>

     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS TRACER</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Lady Filson , do n't keep that horrid snapshot of you and Sir Randle ! It 's too unflattering .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY FILSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>At the writing-table .</stage>As if that mattered ! So are the portraits of Lord and Lady Sturminster on the same page .<stage>Sitting at the table and emptying her bag .</stage>These absurd things give Sir Randle and me a hearty laugh ; that 's why I preserve them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WESTRIP</speaker>
     <p>It is n't here .<stage>Going to the glazed door .</stage>I 'll hunt for it downstairs .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY FILSON</speaker>
     <p>Thank you .<stage>Discovering the pile of press-cuttings .</stage>What 's this ?<stage>Affecting annoyance .</stage>Not more press-cuttings !<stage>Beginning to devour the cuttings .</stage>Tcht , tcht , tcht !</p>

    <stage>As WESTRIP reaches the door , BERTRAM FILSON enters . He is wearing riding-dress .</stage>

     <speaker>LADY FILSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Half turning to BERTRAM , the press-cuttings in her hand .</stage>Ah , my darling ! Was that you I saw speaking to Underwood as I came through the hall ?</p>

     <p>Yes , mother dear .<stage>Bending over her and kissing her .</stage>How are you ?</p>

     <speaker>LADY FILSON</speaker>
     <p>How dreadful for you !<stage>Giving him the press-cuttings .</stage>Sit down , if you 're not too warm , and look at this rubbish while I talk to Miss Tracer .</p>

     <speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
     <p>Press-cuttings ?</p>

     <p>From himself ?</p>

     <p><stage>Opening the door .</stage>Here 's my father ——</p>

    <stage>SIR RANDLE FILSON enters , dressed in mourning . He is a man of sixty-three , of commanding presence , with a head resembling that of Alexandre Dumas Fils in the portrait by Meissonier , and a bland , florid manner . He seems to derive much satisfaction from listening to the rich modulations of his voice .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR RANDLE</speaker>
     <p>Bertram , my boy !<stage>Kissing him upon the cheek .</stage>Been riding , eh ?</p>

     <p>Over .<stage>Passing LADY FILSON and shaking hands with SIR RANDLE .</stage>It might be that it ‘ ud be more decent and appropriate for me to write you a letter , Sir Randle ; but I 'm not much of a hand at letter-writing , and I 've your daughter 's permission to tell you by word of mouth that — that she —<stage>to LADY FILSON</stage>but perhaps you can guess , both of you ——?</p>

     <speaker>LADY FILSON</speaker>
     <p>The merest hint ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p>Hint , is it ! Ah , I can manage that .<stage>With a bold effort .</stage>You 're not to have me for your son-in-law . Is that hint enough ?</p>

     <p><stage>Under her breath .</stage>Oh !</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>SIR RANDLE</speaker>
     <p>God bless me ! Frankly , I had no conception ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY FILSON</speaker>
     <p>Nor I — the faintest .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p>And as I 've received a great deal of kindness and hospitality in this house , I thought that , in common gratitude , I ought to explain the cause of my abrupt disappearance from your circle .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR RANDLE</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a tone of deep commiseration .</stage>I — I understand . You — you intend to ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p>To take a trip round the world , to endeavour to recover some of the wind that 's been knocked out of me .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR RANDLE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Closing his eyes .</stage>Distressing ! Distressing !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY FILSON</speaker>
     <p>Most .<stage>Coming to SIR TIMOTHY , feelingly .</stage>Oh — oh , Sir Timothy ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p><stage>With sudden bitterness .</stage>Ah , Sir Timothy , Sir Timothy , Sir Timothy ! And what 's the use of my baronetcy now , will you inform me — the baronetcy I bought and paid for , in hard cash , to better my footing in society ? The mockery of it ! Now that I 've lost her , the one woman I shall ever love , I do n't care a rap for my footing in society ;<stage>walking away</stage>and anybody may have my baronetcy for tuppence !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR RANDLE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Reprovingly .</stage>My good friend ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Turning to SIR RANDLE and LADY FILSON .</stage>And why not ! The only advantage of my baronetcy , it strikes me , is that I 'm charged double prices at every hotel I lay my head in , and am expected to shower gold on the waiters .<stage>Sitting on the settee on the right and leaning his head on his hand .</stage>Oh , the mockery of it ; the mockery of it !</p>

     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Emphatically , raising his head .</stage>It is not .<stage>With a despairing gesture .</stage>I 'm broken-hearted , Sir Randle . That 's what I am ; I 'm broken-hearted .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY FILSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sitting in the low-backed arm-chair on the left .</stage>Oh , dear !</p>

     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sighing .</stage>If I 'd had the pluck to declare myself sooner , it might have been different .<stage>Staring before him .</stage>From the moment I first set eyes on her , at the dinner-party you gave to welcome her on her arrival in London — from that moment I was captured completely , body and soul . The sight of her as she stood in the drawing-room beside her mother , with her pretty , white face and her elegant figure , and a gown clinging to her that looked as though she 'd been born in it — ‘ twill never fade from me if I live to be as old as a dozen Methuselahs !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR RANDLE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pryingly .</stage>Er — has Ottoline — I have no desire to probe an open wound — has she assigned any — reason ——?</p>

     <p>I agree , my dear mother ; but it would have been horribly offensive to us , I mean t'say , to see the name of Ottoline 's husband branded upon sides of bacon in the windows of the provision-shops .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR RANDLE</speaker>
     <p>Ottoline being a widow , there can be no bridesmaids ; which deprives us of the happiness of paying a pretty compliment to the daughters of several families of distinction whom we have the privilege of numbering among our acquaintances .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY FILSON</speaker>
     <p>There can be no bridesmaids , strictly speaking ; but a widow may be accompanied to the altar by a bevy of Maids of Honour .</p>

     <p><stage>Expanding his chest and advancing to PHILIP .</stage>I gather from my daughter , Mr. Mackworth , that you are here for the purpose of “ explaining your position ” in relation to her . I believe I quote her words accurately ——</p>

     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Moving to the fireplace .</stage>Yes , Dad .</p>

     <p>That is so , Sir Randle — if you and Lady Filson will have the patience ——</p>

    <stage>SIR RANDLE motions PHILIP to the settee on the right . PHILIP sits . Then OTTOLINE sits on the settee before the fireplace , and SIR RANDLE in the arm-chair by PHILIP . LADY FILSON turns in her chair to listen .</stage>

     <speaker>SIR RANDLE</speaker>
     <p><stage>To PHILIP , majestically .</stage>Before you embark upon your explanation , permit me to define my position — mine and Lady Filson 's .<stage>PHILIP nods .</stage>I am going to make a confession to you ; and I should like to feel that I am making it as one gentleman to another .<stage>PHILIP nods again .</stage>Mr. Mackworth , Lady Filson and I are ambitious people . Not for ourselves . For ourselves , all we desire is rest and retirement —<stage>closing his eyes</stage>if it were possible , obscurity . But where our children are concerned , it is different ; and , to be frank — I must be frank — we had hoped that , in the event of Ottoline remarrying , she would contract such a marriage as is commonly described as brilliant .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Dryly .</stage>Such a marriage as her marriage to Monsieur de Chaumié , for example .</p>

     <speaker>SIR RANDLE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Closing his eyes .</stage>De mortuis , Mr. Mackworth ! I must decline ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>I merely wished , as a basis of argument , to get at your exact interpretation of brilliancy .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR RANDLE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Dismissing the point with a wave of the hand .</stage>It is easy for you , therefore , as you have already intimated , to judge what are our sensations at receiving my daughter 's communication .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Nodding .</stage>They are distinctly disagreeable .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR RANDLE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Conscientiously .</stage>They are — I wo n't exaggerate — I must n't exaggerate — they are not far removed from dismay .</p>

     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>To SIR RANDLE , bluntly .</stage>Yes , I do know of the settlement you made upon Ottoline on her marriage , and of your having supplemented it when she became a widow . Very handsome of you .</p>

     <speaker>LADY FILSON</speaker>

     <speaker>LADY FILSON</speaker>
     <p>Unhappily .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR RANDLE</speaker>
     <p>If she will deal this crushing blow to her mother and myself , we must bow our heads to it . But , for the sake of your self-esteem , I beg you to reflect !<stage>Partly to PHILIP , partly at OTTOLINE .</stage>What construction would be put upon a union between you and Madame de Chaumié — between a lady of means and — I must be cruel — I must be brutal — a man who is — commercially at least — a failure ?</p>

     <speaker>LADY FILSON</speaker>

     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>My dear Sir Randle —<stage>rising and going to LADY FILSON</stage>— my dear Lady Filson — let me dispel your anxiety for the preservation of my self-esteem . Ottoline and I have no idea of getting married yet awhile .</p>

     <p>Why grotesque ; why amazing ?<stage>Sitting in the low-backed arm-chair .</stage>All that is amazing about it is that Philip should lack the superior courage which enables a man , in special circumstances , to sink his pride and ignore ill-natured comments .</p>

     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>To LADY FILSON .</stage>At any rate , this is the arrangement that Ottoline and I have entered into ; and I suggest , with every respect , that you and Sir Randle should raise no obstacle to my seeing her under your roof occasionally .</p>

     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I 've been at it for nearly ten years .</p>

     <p><stage>Rousing himself and turning to SIR RANDLE and LADY FILSON — abruptly .</stage>Look here , Sir Randle ! Look here , Lady Filson ! I own that this arrangement between Ottoline and me is an odd one . It was arrived at yesterday impulsively ; and , in her interests , there is a good deal to be said against it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY FILSON</speaker>
     <p>There 's nothing to be said for it . Oh ——!</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Well , Sir Randle , I — I 'm prepared to take a sporting chance . It may be that I am misled by the sanguine temperament of the artist , who is apt to believe that his latest production will shake the earth to its foundation . I 've gammoned myself before into such a belief , but —<stage>resolutely</stage>I 'll stake everything on my next book ! I give you my word that if it is n't a success — an indisputable popular success — I will join you both , in all sincerity , in urging Ottoline to break with me . Come ! Does that mollify you ?</p>

    <stage>There is a short silence . SIR RANDLE and LADY FILSON look at each other in surprise and OTTOLINE stares at PHILIP open-mouthed .</stage>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Deliberately , but losing himself in his subject as he proceeds .</stage>It shows a vast crowd of men and women , sir , forcing themselves upon public attention without a shred of modesty , fighting to obtain it as if they are fighting for bread and meat . It shows how dignity and reserve have been cast aside as virtues that are antiquated and outworn , until half the world — the world that should be orderly , harmonious , beautiful — has become an arena for the exhibition of vulgar ostentation or almost superhuman egoism — a cockpit resounding with raucous voices bellowing one against the other !</p>

     <p>It shows the bishop and the judge playing to the gallery , the politician adopting the methods of the cheap-jack , the duchess vying with the puffing draper ; it shows how even true genius submits itself to conditions that are accepted and excused as “ modern , ” and is found elbowing and pushing in the hurly-burly . It shows how the ordinary decencies of life are sacrificed to the paragraphist , the interviewer , and the ghoul with the camera ; how the home is stripped of its sanctity , blessed charity made a vehicle for display , the very grave-yard transformed into a parade ground ; while the outsider looks on with a sinking of the vitals because the drumstick is beyond his reach and the bom-bom-bom is not for him ! It shows ——!<stage>Checking himself and leaving the arm-chair with a short laugh .</stage>Oh , well , that 's the setting of my story , Sir Randle ! I wo n't inflict the details upon you .</p>

    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>The scene represents two rooms , connected by a pair of wide doors , in a set of residential chambers on the upper floor of a house in Gray 's Inn . The further room is the dining-room , the nearer room a study . In the wall at the back of the dining-room are two windows ; in the right-hand wall is a door leading to the kitchen ; and in the left-hand wall a door opens from a vestibule , where , opposite this door , there is another door which gives on to the landing of the common stair .</stage>
     <stage>In the study , a door in the right-hand wall admits to a bedroom ; in the wall facing the spectator is a door opening into the room from the vestibule ; and beyond the door on the right , in a piece of wall cutting off the corner of the room , is the fireplace . A bright fire is burning .</stage>
     <stage>The rooms are wainscotted to the ceilings and have a decrepit , old-world air , and the odds and ends of furniture — all characteristic of the dwelling of a poor literary man of refined taste — are in keeping with the surroundings . In the dining-room there are half-a-dozen chairs of various patterns , a sideboard or two , a corner-cupboard , a “ grandfather ” clock , and a large round table . In the study , set out into the room at the same angle as the fireplace , is a writing-table . A chair stands at the writing-table , its back to the fire , and in the front of the table is a well-worn settee . On the left of the settee is a smaller table , on which are an assortment of pipes , a box of cigars and another of cigarettes , a tobacco-jar , an ash-tray , and a bowl of matches ; and on the left of the table is a capacious arm-chair . There is an arm-chair on either side of the fireplace ; and against the right-hand wall , on the nearer side of the bedroom door , is a cabinet .</stage>
     <stage>On the other side of the room , facing the bedroom door , there is a second settee , and behind the settee is an oblong table littered with books and magazines . At a little distance from this table stands an arm-chair , and against the wall at the back , on the left of the big doors , is a chair of a lighter sort . Also against the back wall , but on the left of the door opening from the vestibule , is a table with a telephone-instrument upon it , and running along the left-hand wall is a dwarf bookcase , unglazed , packed with books which look as if they would be none the worse for being dusted and put in order .</stage>
     <stage>In the vestibule , against the wall on the right , there is a small table on which are Philip 's hats , caps , and gloves ; and an overcoat and a man 's cape are hanging on some pegs .</stage>
     <stage>It is late on a November afternoon . Curtains are drawn across the dining-room windows , and the room is lighted rather dimly by an electric lamp standing upon a sideboard . A warm glow proceeds from the nearer right-hand corner as from a fire . The study is lighted by a couple of standard lamps and a library-lamp on the writing-table , and the vestibule by a lamp suspended from the ceiling .</stage>
     <stage>The big doors are open .</stage>
     <stage>[ PHILIP , a pipe in his mouth and wearing an old velvet jacket , is lying upon the settee on the right , reading a book by the light of the lamp on the writing-table . In the dining-room , JOHN and a waiter — the latter in his shirt-sleeves — are at the round table , unfolding a white table-cloth .</stage>

     <p><stage>Crossing to the fireplace , rubbing his hands , as JOHN retires to the dining-room .</stage>Oh , my dear Phil , this dreadful climate after the sunshine of the Lago Maggiore !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Walking about and spouting , in high spirits .</stage>“ Italia ! O Italia ! thou who hast the fatal gift of beauty ——! ”</p>

     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>Sir Loftus and Lady Glazebrook were moving on to Rome , or I really believe I could have endured another month at their villa , bores as they are , dear kind souls !<stage>Looking towards the dining-room , where JOHN and the waiter are now placing a handsome centre-piece of flowers upon the round table .</stage>Hallo ! A dinner-party , Phil ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Dinner-party ? A banquet !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>To celebrate the success of the book ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>That and something more . This festival , sir , of the preparations for which you are a privileged spectator —<stage>shouting to JOHN</stage>shut those doors , John ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JOHN</speaker>
     <p>Yessir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sitting in the chair on the left of the smoking-table as JOHN closes the big doors .</stage>This festival , my dear Robbie —<stage>glancing over his shoulder to assure himself that the doors are closed</stage>this festival also celebrates my formal engagement to Madame de Chaumié .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Triumphantly .</stage>Aha !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taking a cigarette from the box at his side .</stage>Ottoline and I are to be married soon after Christmas . The civilized world is to be startled by the announcement on Monday .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Advancing .</stage>My dear chap , I 've never heard anything that has given me greater pleasure .<stage>PHILIP offers ROOPE the cigarette-box .</stage>No , I wo n't smoke .<stage>Seating himself upon the settee on the right .</stage>When was it settled ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Lighting his cigarette .</stage>The day before yesterday . I got Titterton to write me a letter — Titterton , my publisher — certifying to the enormous sales of the book , and sent it on to Sir Randle Filson . Nothing like documentary evidence , Robbie .<stage>Leaning back in his chair with outstretched legs and exhaling a wreath of tobacco-smoke .</stage>Twenty-five thousand copies , my boy , up to date , and still going strong .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>Wonderful .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Phew ! The critics treated me generously enough , but it hung fire damnably at first . At one particularly hellish moment I could have sworn it would n't do more than my usual fifteen or eighteen hundred , and I cursed myself for having been such a besotted fool as to pin my faith to it .<stage>Sitting upright .</stage>And then , suddenly , a rush — a tremendous rush ! Twenty-four thousand went off in less than six weeks . Almost uncanny , eh ?<stage>Touching the tobacco-jar .</stage>Oh , lord , sometimes I think I 've been putting opium into my pipe instead of this innocent baccy , and that I shall wake up to the necessity of counting my pence again and apologizing to John for being in arrear with his wages !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>And Titterton 's letter brought the Filsons round ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Nodding .</stage>Brought ‘ em round ; and I must say they 've accomplished the change of attitude most graciously .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Oracularly .</stage>Graciously or grudgingly , they could n't help themselves , dear excellent friend . As you had pledged yourself in effect to resign the lady if your book was a failure , it follows that they were bound to clasp you to their bosoms if it succeeded . I do n't want to detract from the amiability of the Filsons for an instant ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Anyhow , their opposition is at an end , and all is rosy .<stage>Rising and pacing the room .</stage>Master Bertram is a trifle glum and stand-offish perhaps , but Sir Randle —! Ha , ha , ha ! Sir Randle has taken Literature under his wing , Robbie , from Chaucer to Kipling , in the person of his prospective son-in-law . You 'd imagine , to listen to him , that to establish ties of relationship with a literary man has been his chief aim in life .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Jerking his head in the direction of the dining-room .</stage>And this is to be a family gathering ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>The first in the altered circumstances . I proposed a feast at a smart restaurant , but Sir Randle preferred the atmosphere which has conduced , as he puts it , to the creation of so many of my brilliant compositions .<stage>Behind the smoking-table , dropping the end of his cigarette into the ash-tray — gaily .</stage>Robbie , I 've had a magnificent suit of joy-rags made for the occasion !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Earnestly .</stage>Good ! I rejoice to hear it , dear excellent friend , and I hope it portends a wholesale order to your tailor and your intention to show yourself in society again freely .<stage>With a laugh , PHILIP goes to the fireplace and stands looking into the fire .</stage>Begin leaving your cards at once . No more sulking in your tent !<stage>Rising and crossing to the other side of the room .</stage>You have arrived , my dear chap ; I read your name in two papers in my cabin yesterday .<stage>Marching up and down .</stage>Your foot is on the ladder ; you bid fair to become a celebrity , if you are not one already ; and your approaching marriage sheds additional lustre on you . I envy you , Phil ; I do , positively .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Facing ROOPE .</stage>Oh , of course , I shall be seen about with Ottoline during our engagement . Afterwards ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Halting .</stage>Afterwards ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Everything will depend on my wife —<stage>relishing the word</stage>my wife . Ottoline has rather lost her taste for Society with a capital S , remember .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Testily .</stage>That was her mood last June , when she was hypped and discontented . With a husband she can be proud of , surely ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coming forward .</stage>As a matter of fact , Robbie , I 'm inclined to agree with you ; I 've been staring into my fire , or out of my windows here , a jolly sight too much .<stage>Expanding his chest .</stage>It 'll be refreshing to me to rub shoulders with people again for a bit —<stage>smiling</stage>even to find myself the object of a little interest and curiosity .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Delighted .</stage>Dear excellent friend !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Ha , ha ! You see , I 'm not without my share of petty vanity . I 'm consistent , though . Did n't I tell you in South Audley Street that I was as eager for fame as any man living , if only I could win it in my own way ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>You did .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Exultingly .</stage>Well , I have won it in my own way , have n't I !<stage>Hitting the palm of his hand with his fist .</stage>I 've done what I determined to do , Robbie ; what I knew I should do , sooner or later ! I 've got there — got there !— by simple , honest means ! Is n't it glorious ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Cautiously .</stage>I admit ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Breaking in .</stage>Oh , I do n't pretend that there have n't been moments in my years of stress and struggle when I 've been tempted to join the gaudy , cackling fowl whose feathers I flatter myself I 've plucked pretty thoroughly in my book ! But I 've resisted the devil by prayers and fasting ; and , by George , sir , I would n't swap my modest victory for the vogue of the biggest boomster in England !<stage>Boisterously .</stage>Ha , ha , ha ! Whoop !<stage>Seizing ROOPE and shaking him .</stage>Dare to preach your gospel to me now , you arch-apostle of quackery and self-advertisement !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Peevishly , releasing himself .</stage>Upon my word , Phil ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The bell rings again .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>The cook !</l>
      <stage>To ROOPE , seeing that he is putting on his muffler .</stage>
      <l>Do n't go .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>I must .<stage>Taking up his overcoat .</stage>I merely ran along to shake hands with you , and I 'm sorry I took the trouble .<stage>PHILIP helps him into his overcoat laughingly .</stage>Thanks .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Suddenly .</stage>Robbie ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Struggling with an obstinate sleeve .</stage>Hey ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>It 's just struck me . Where are you dining to-night ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>At the Garrick , with Hughie Champion .<stage>Picking up his hat and gloves .</stage>He 's getting horribly deaf and tedious ; but I had nothing better .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Bother Colonel Champion ! I wish you could have dined with me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>His hat on his head , drawing on his gloves .</stage>Dear excellent friend ! I should be out of place .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Rubbish ! Your presence would be peculiarly appropriate , my dear Robbie . Was n't it you who brought Ottoline and me together , God bless yer !<stage>Observing that ROOPE is weakening .</stage>There 's heaps of room for an extra chair . Everybody ‘ ud be delighted .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Meditatively .</stage>I could telephone to Hughie excusing myself . He did n't ask me till this afternoon .<stage>With an injured air .</stage>I resent a short notice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>His eyes twinkling .</stage>Quite right . Mine 's short too ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>That 's different .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Entirely . You 'll come ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>If you 're certain the Filsons and Madame de Chaumié ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Certain .</l>
      <stage>Following ROOPE to the door admitting to the vestibule .</stage>
      <l>Eight o'clock .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Opening the door .</stage>Charming .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Wo n't you let John fetch you a taxi ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Shaking hands with PHILIP .</stage>No , I 'll walk into Holborn .<stage>In the doorway .</stage>Oh , by-the-by , I 've a message for you , Phil .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>From whom ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>Barradell , of all people in the world .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Surprised .</stage>Sir Timothy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>He 's home . I crossed with him yesterday , and we travelled in the same carriage from Dover .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>What 's the message ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>He saw your book in my bag , and began talking about you . He said he had n't met you for years , but that I was to give you his warm regards .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Indeed ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Astutely .</stage>My impression is that he 's heard rumours concerning you and Madame de Chaumié while he 's been away , and that he 's anxious to show he has no ill-will . I suppose your calling so often in Ennismore Gardens has been remarked .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Extremely civil of him , if that 's the case .<stage>Loftily .</stage>Decent sort of fellow , I recollect .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Going into the vestibule .</stage>Very ; very .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Poor chap !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Opening the outer door .</stage>Eight o'clock , dear excellent friend .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>At his elbow .</stage>Sharp .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Disappearing .</stage>Au revoir !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Au revoir !<stage>Calling after ROOPE .</stage>Mind that corner !<stage>Closing the outer door with a bang and shouting .</stage>John !<stage>Coming back into the study .</stage>John !<stage>Closing the vestibule door .</stage>John !<stage>Going to the big doors and opening the one on the left a little way .</stage>John ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>OTTOLINE , richly dressed in furs , steps through the opening and confronts him . Her cheeks are flushed and her manner has lost some of its repose .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Shutting the door behind her as she enters — playfully .</stage>Qu'esthYpppHeNce que vous désirez John ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Catching her in his arms .</stage>My dear girl !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>Ha , ha ! I 'm not going to stop a minute .<stage>Rapidly .</stage>I 've been to tea with Kitty Millington ; and as I was getting into my car , I suddenly thought —!<stage>He kisses her .</stage>I waited in there to avoid Robbie Roope .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Robbie came back yesterday . I hope I have n't done wrong ; I 've asked him to dine here to-night .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>Wrong ! Dear old Robbie ! But I did n't want him just now .<stage>Loosening her wrap and hunting for a pocket in it .</stage>I 've brought you a little gift , Phil — en souvenir de cette soirée ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Reprovingly .</stage>Oh ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>I got it at Cartier 's this afternoon . I meant to slip it into your serviette to-night quietly , but it 's burning a hole in my pocket .<stage>She produces a small jewel-case and presents it to him .</stage>Will you wear that in your tie sometimes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Opening the case and gazing at its contents .</stage>Phiou !<stage>She leaves him , walking away to the fireplace .</stage>What a gorgeous pearl !<stage>He follows her and they stand side by side , he holding the case at arm'shYpppHeNlength admiringly , his other arm round her waist .</stage>You should n't , Otto . You 're incorrigible .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Leaning her head against his shoulder — softly .</stage>Phil ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Still gazing at the scarf-pin .</stage>To-morrow I 'll buy the most beautiful silk scarf ever weaved .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>Phil , I 've a feeling that it 's from to-night , when I sit at your table — how sweet your flowers are ; I could n't help noticing them !— I 've a feeling that it 's from to-night that we really belong to each other .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pressing her closer to him .</stage>Ah ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a shiver , closing her eyes .</stage>What has gone before has been hateful — hateful !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking down upon her fondly .</stage>Hateful ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>Until — until your book commenced to sell , at any rate . Suspense — a horrid sensation of uneasiness , mistrust — the fear that , through your foolish , hasty promise to mother and Dad , you might , after all , unite with them to cheat me out of my happiness ! That 's what it has been to me , Philip .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rallying her , but a little guiltily .</stage>Ha , ha , ha ! You goose ! I knew exactly how events would shape , Otto ; had n't a doubt on the subject .<stage>Shutting the jewel-case with a snap and a flourish .</stage>I knew ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Releasing herself .</stage>Ah , yes , I dare say I 've been dreadfully stupid .<stage>Shaking herself , as if to rid herself of unpleasant memories , and again leaving him .</stage>Well ! Sans adieu !<stage>Fastening her wrap .</stage>Get your hat and take me downstairs .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Wait a moment !<stage>Chuckling .</stage>Ho , ho ! I 'm not to be outdone altogether .<stage>Pocketing her gift , he goes to the cabinet on the right and unlocks it . She watches him from the middle of the room . Presently he comes to her , carrying a little ring-case .</stage>Take off your glove —<stage>pointing to her left hand</stage>that one .<stage>She removes her glove tremulously . He takes a ring from the case , tosses the case on to the writing-table , and slips the ring on her third finger .</stage>By George , I 'm in luck ; blessed if it does n't fit !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She surveys the ring in silence for a while ; then she puts her arms round his neck and hides her face on his breast .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Almost inaudibly .</stage>Oh , Phil !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Tenderly .</stage>And so this is the end of the journey , Otto !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a whisper .</stage>The end ?</p>

     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>My dear , what does it matter as long as our roads meet at last , and meet where there are clear pools to bathe our vagabond feet and sunshine to heal our sore bodies !<stage>She raises her head and rummages for her handkerchief .</stage>Otto ——!</p>

    <stage>She hurries to the outer door . He follows her quickly , closing the vestibule door after him . Then the outer door is heard to shut , and the curtain falls . After a short interval , the curtain rises again , showing all the doors closed and the study in darkness save for the light of the fire . The bell rings , and again there is an interval ; and then the vestibule door is opened by JOHN — attired for waiting at table — and BERTRAM brushes past him and enters . BERTRAM is in evening dress .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>As he enters , brusquely .</stage>Yes , I know I 'm a little too soon . I want to speak to Mr. Mackworth — before the others come , I mean t'say ——</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>JOHN switches on the light of a lamp by the vestibule door . It is now seen that BERTRAM is greatly flustered and excited .</stage>

     <speaker>JOHN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taking BERTRAM 's hat , overcoat , etc .</stage>I 'll tell Mr. Mackworth , sir . He 's dressin ’ .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Calling to BERTRAM again .</stage>I 'm in the throes of tying a bow , old man . Sit down .<stage>BERTRAM , glaring at the bedroom door , remains standing .</stage>O'ho , that 's fine ! Ha , ha , ha ! I warn you , I 'm an overpowering swell to-night . A new suit of clothes , Bertram , devised and executed in less than thirty-six hours ! And a fit , sir ; every item of it ! You 'll be green with envy when you see this coat . I 'm ready for you . Handkerchief —?<stage>Shouting .</stage>John —!

     <speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
     <p>You 've attempted to play us all a rascally trick , Mackworth ; a low , scurvy , contemptible ——</p>

     <speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
     <p>I 've just come from Mr. Dunning — a man I 've thought it my duty to employ in the interests of my family — Sillitoe and Dunning , the private-inquiry people ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Private-inquiry people ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
     <p>Dunning rang me up an hour ago , and I went down to him . The discovery was n't clinched till this afternoon ——</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>The discovery ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Derisively .</stage>Ho ! This precious book of yours — “ The Big Drum ” ! A grand success , Mackworth !</p>

     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Fraud ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
     <p>Reached its twenty-fifth thousand , and the demand still continues ! You and Mr. what'shYpppHeNhishYpppHeNname — Titterton — ought to be publicly exposed , Mackworth ; and if we were in the least spiteful and vindictive ——</p>

     <p><stage>Tightening his lips .</stage>Are you sober , Filson ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
     <p>Now , do n't you be insolent , because it wo n't answer .<stage>PHILIP winces , but restrains himself .</stage>The question is , what are we to do to-night — for Ottoline 's sake , I mean t'say . We must spare her as much shock and distress as possible . I assume you 've sufficient decency left to agree with me there . My father and mother too — they 're quite ignorant of the steps I 've been taking ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Controlling himself with difficulty .</stage>My good fellow , will you condescend to explain ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Walking away .</stage>Oh , it 's no use , Mackworth — this air of innocence !<stage>Puffing himself out and strutting to and fro on the left .</stage>It 's simply wasted effort , I mean t'say . In five minutes I can have Dunning here with the whole disreputable story . He 's close by — bottom of Chancery Lane . He 'll be at his office till half-past-eleven ——</p>

      <stage>Between his teeth — thrusting his hands into his trouser-pockets .</stage>
      <l>Very accommodating of him !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
     <p>I tried to get on to my father from Dunning 's — to ask his advice , I mean t'say — but he 'd dressed early and gone to one of his clubs , and they could n't tell me which one .<stage>Halting and looking at his watch .</stage>My suggestion is that you and I should struggle through this farce of a dinner as best we can — as if nothing had happened . I mean t'say — and that I should reserve the disclosure of your caddish conduct till to-morrow . You assent to that course , Mackworth ?<stage>Dabbing his forehead with his handkerchief .</stage>Thank heaven , the announcement of the engagement has n't appeared !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a calm voice .</stage>Bertram —<stage>pointing to the chair on the left of the smoking-table</stage>Bertie , old man —<stage>seating himself easily upon the settee on the right</stage>you 're your sister 's brother and I 'm not going to lose my temper ——</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Leaning back and crossing his legs .</stage>One thing I seem to grasp clearly ; and that is that , while I 've been endeavouring to conciliate you , and make a pal of you , you 've been leaguing yourself with a tame detective with the idea of injuring me in some way with Ottoline and your father and mother .<stage>Folding his arms .</stage>That 's correct , is n't it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a disdainful shrug .</stage>If you think it will benefit you to distort my motives , Mackworth , pray do so .<stage>Returning to the middle of the room .</stage>What I 've done , I 've done , as I 've already stated , from a sheer sense of duty ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Again pointing to the chair .</stage>Please ! You 'll look less formidable , old man ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sitting , haughtily .</stage>Knowing what depended on the fate of your book , I felt from the first that you might be unscrupulous enough to induce your publisher to represent it as being a popular success — in order to impose on us , I mean t'say — though actually it was another of your failures to hit the mark ; and when Titterton started blowing the trumpet so loudly , my suspicions increased .<stage>PHILIP slowly unfolds his arms .</stage>As for desiring to injure you with my family at any price , I scorn the charge . I 've had the delicacy to refrain from even mentioning my suspicions to my father and mother , let alone Ottoline .<stage>Putting his necktie straight and smoothing his hair and his slightly crumpled shirt-front .</stage>Deeply as I regret your connection with my sister , I should have been only too happy , I mean t'say , if my poor opinion of you had been falsified .</p>

     <speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a pitying tone .</stage>Oh , my dear Mackworth ! I repeat , it 's no use your adopting this attitude . You do n't realize how completely you 're bowled over , I mean t'say . Dunning 's got incontestable proofs ——</p>

     <speaker>SIR RANDLE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Not perceiving the general air of restraint .</stage>That reminds me —<stage>moving , full of importance , to the settee on the right — feeling in his breast-pocket</stage>the announcement of the engagement , Philip —<stage>seating himself and producing a pocket-book</stage>Lady Filson and I drew it up this morning .<stage>Hunting among some letters and papers .</stage>I believe it is in the conventional form ; but we so thoroughly sympathize with you and Ottoline in your dislike for anything that savours of pomp and flourish that we hesitate , without your sanction , to —<stage>selecting a paper and handing it to PHILIP</stage>ah !<stage>To ROOPE , who has returned to the fireplace — over his shoulder .</stage>I am treating you as one of ourselves , Mr. Roope ——</p>

     <p>This has “ Universal News Agency ” written in the corner of it .</p>

     <p><stage>Ignoring SIR RANDLE 's hand — reading .</stage>“ The extraordinary stir , which we venture to prophesy will not soon be eclipsed , made by Mr. Philip Mackworth 's recent novel , ‘ The Big Drum , ’ lends additional interest to the announcement of his forthcoming marriage to the beautiful Madame de Chaumié — ”<stage>The bell rings . He listens to it , and then goes on reading .</stage>“ — the beautiful Madame de Chaumié , daughter of the widely and deservedly popular — the widely and deservedly popular Sir Randle and Lady Filson —— ”</p>

    <stage>After reading it to the end silently , he restores the paper to SIR RANDLE with a smile and a slight bow .</stage>

    <stage>PHILIP has joined OTTOLINE in the vestibule . He now follows her into the room , shutting the vestibule door . She is elegantly dressed in white and , though she has recovered her usual stateliness and composure , is a picture of radiant happiness .</stage>

    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>

     <p>Yes . And when Mr. Dunning calls —<stage>distinctly</stage>Dunning ——</p>

     <p>Yessir .</p>

     <p>You may serve dinner as soon as he 's gone . I 'll ring .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>JOHN and the waiter withdraw into the kitchen , whereupon PHILIP , after watching their departure , deliberately closes the big doors . ROOPE , who has been picking at his nails nervously , rises and steals away to the left , and SIR RANDLE , advancing a step or two , exchanges questioning glances with LADY FILSON .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laughingly .</stage>What a terrible shock ! I was frightened that Philip had sprung a strange guest upon us .<stage>As PHILIP is shutting the doors .</stage>Vous êtes bien mystérieux , Phil ? Why are we to starve until this Mr. Dunning has come and gone ?</p>

     <p>Philip !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>At the chair beside the smoking-table — to LADY FILSON .</stage>I apologize very humbly for making you and Sir Randle , and dear Ottoline , parties to such unpleasant proceedings , Lady Filson ; but the necessity is forced upon me .<stage>Coming forward .</stage>Mr. Dunning is one of those crawling creatures who conduct what are known as confidential inquiries . In other words , he 's a private detective — an odd sort of person to present to you !——</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>LADY FILSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Under her breath .</stage>Great heavens !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>And he has lightened your son 's purse , presumably , and crammed his willing ears with some ridiculous , fantastic tale concerning my book — “ The Big Drum . ” Mr. Dunning professes to have discovered that I have conspired with a wicked publisher to deceive you all ; that the book 's another of my miss-hits , and that I 'm a designing rogue and liar .<stage>To BERTRAM .</stage>Come on , Bertram ; do n't sit there as if you were a stuffed figure ! Speak out , and tell your father and mother what you 've been up to !</p>
    </sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Approaching LADY FILSON .</stage>You see , Lady Filson , Master Bertram is endowed with an exceptionally active brain ; and when I gave those assurances to you and Sir Randle last June , it occurred to him that , in the event of my book failing to attract the market , there was a danger of my palming it off , with the kind aid of my publisher , as the out-and-out triumph I 'd bragged of in advance ; and the loud blasts of Titterton 's trumpet strengthened Master Bertie 's apprehensions .<stage>OTTOLINE , unobserved , rises unsteadily and , with her eyes fixed fiercely upon BERTRAM , crosses the room at the back .</stage>So what does he do , bless him for his devotion to his belongings ! To safeguard his parents from being jockeyed , and as a brotherly precaution , he enlists the services , on the sly , of the obliging Mr. Dunning . We shall shortly have an opportunity of judging what that individual 's game is .<stage>With a shrug .</stage>He may have stumbled legitimately into a mare 's nest ; but I doubt it . These ruffians 'll stick at nothing to keep an ingenuous client on the hook —<stage>He is interrupted by feeling OTTOLINE 's hand upon his arm . He lays his hand on hers gently .</stage>Otto dear ——</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Oh , it 'll be all over in ten minutes . And then Bertie and I will shake hands — wo n't we , Bertie ?— and forget the wretched incident ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Confronting BERTRAM , trembling with passion .</stage>How dare you ! How dare you meddle with my affairs — mine and Mr. Mackworth 's ! How dare you !</p>

Mackworth — “ The Big Drum ” — published September the second , and drew our attention to the advertisements of Mr. Mackworth 's publisher — Mr. Clifford Titterton , of Charles Street , Adelphi — relating to the same . Mr. F. having made us acquainted with the special circumstances of the case , and furnished us with his reasons for doubting Titterton 's flowery statements ,<stage>wetting his thumb again and turning to the next leaf of his note-book</stage>on the following day , the twenty-fifth , I purchased a copy of the said book at Messrs. Blake and Hodgson 's in the Strand , Mr. Hodgson himself informing me in the course of conversation that , as far as his firm was concerned , the book was n't doing anything out of the ordinary .<stage>Repeating the thumb process .</stage>I then proceeded to pump one of the gals — er — to interrogate one of the assistants — at a circulating library Mrs. D. subscribes to , with a similar result .<stage>Turning to the next leaf .</stage>My next step ——</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>DUNNING</speaker>
     <p><stage>Imperturbably .</stage>My next step was to place the book in the hands of a lady whose liter'y judgment is a great deal sounder than mine or Mr. Sillitoe 's — I allude to Mrs. D .— and her report was that , though amusing in parts , she did n't see anything in it to set the Thames on fire .</p>

     <p>To which I reluctantly assented .</p>

    </sp>
    <stage>BERTRAM , aghast , nudges DUNNING and hurries to the vestibule door . DUNNING follows him into the vestibule on tiptoe .

    </sp>
    <stage>DUNNING disappears , and BERTRAM closes the outer door and comes back into the room . Shutting the vestibule door , he sinks into the chair lately vacated by DUNNING . There is a silence , broken at length by a low , grating laugh from PHILIP .</stage>

    <stage>His laughter ceases abruptly and he looks her full in the face .</stage>

     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>After a moment 's pause , bitingly .</stage>Thank you — thank you —<stage>turning from her and seating himself in the chair by the smoking-table and resting his chin on his fist</stage>thank you .</p>

    <stage>Again there is a pause , and then OTTOLINE draws herself up proudly and moves in a stately fashion towards the vestibule door .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>At BERTRAM 's side .</stage>Bertram — my cloak ——</p>

    <stage>BERTRAM rises meekly and fetches her cloak .</stage>

     <speaker>SIR RANDLE</speaker>
     <p><stage>To PHILIP , laying a hand on his shoulder .</stage>My daughter has brought great humiliation upon us — upon her family , my dear Philip — by this — I must be harsh — by this unladylike transaction ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY FILSON</speaker>
     <p>I have never felt so ashamed in my life !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR RANDLE</speaker>
     <p><stage>To PHILIP .</stage>By-and-by I shall be better able to command language in which to express my profound regret .<stage>Offering his hand .</stage>For the present — good night , and God bless you !</p>

    </sp>
    <stage>As SIR RANDLE turns away , LADY FILSON comes to PHILIP . BERTRAM , having helped OTTOLINE with her cloak , now brings LADY FILSON 's wrap from the vestibule . SIR RANDLE takes it from him , and BERTRAM then returns to the vestibule and puts on his overcoat .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY FILSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>To PHILIP , who rises .</stage>You must have us to dinner another time , Philip .

     <p><stage>Gratefully .</stage>Good night .</p>

    <stage>LADY FILSON leaves PHILIP and looks about for her wrap . SIR RANDLE puts her into it and then goes into the vestibule and wrestles with his overcoat .</stage>

     <p>Yes , but I mean to say ——!</p>

     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>And I mean to say that I 'm in your debt for showing me that I 've been a vain , credulous ass . Now be off and get some food .<stage>Holding out his hand .</stage>Good night .</p>

    </sp>
    <stage>LADY FILSON and BERTRAM join SIR RANDLE in the vestibule and SIR RANDLE opens the outer door . PHILIP , his hands behind him and his chin on his breast , has walked to the fireplace and is standing there looking fixedly into the fire . OTTOLINE slowly comes forward and fingers the back of the chair by the smoking-table .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>Good night , Philip .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He turns to her , makes her a stiff , formal bow , and faces the fire again .</stage>

    <stage>With a queenly air she sweeps into the vestibule and follows SIR RANDLE and LADY FILSON out on to the landing . BERTRAM closes the vestibule door , and immediately afterwards the outer door slams .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>To PHILIP , in an agony .</stage>No , no , Phil ! It must n't end like this ! Good lord , man , reflect — consider what you 're chucking away !

     <stage>The scene is the same , the light that of a fine winter morning . The big doors are open , and from the dining-room windows , where the curtains are now drawn back , there is a view of some buildings opposite and , through a space between the buildings , of the tops of the bare trees in Gray 's Inn garden .</stage>
     <stage>Save for a chair with a crumpled napkin upon it which stands at the dining-table before the remains of PHILIP 's breakfast , the disposition of the furniture is as when first shown .</stage>
     <stage>A fire is burning in the nearer room .</stage>

     <p>And of me , dear excellent friend .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Grimly .</stage>For your share in the business .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a nod .</stage>The fatal luncheon in South Audley Street . However , she soon softened , and came and knelt by the fire . And suddenly — you 've seen a child fall on the pavement and cut its knees , have n't you , Phil ?——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Of course I have .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>That 's how she cried . I was really alarmed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>The — the end of it being ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Dismally .</stage>The end of it being that she went off to bed , declaring that she recognizes that the breach between you is beyond healing , and that she 's resolved never to cross your path again if she can avoid it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laying his pipe aside .</stage>Ha !<stage>Scowling at ROOPE .</stage>And so this is the result of your self-appointed mission , is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hurt .</stage>That 's rather ungrateful , Phil ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Starting up and walking away to the left .</stage>P'sha !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>If you 'd heard how I reasoned with her ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Striding up and down .</stage>What had I better do ? It 's good of you to be here so early .<stage>ROOPE rises .</stage>I 'm not ungrateful , Robbie . Advise me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Stiffly .</stage>I assume , from your tone , that what you wish to do is to — er ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>To abase myself before her ; to grovel at her feet and crave her pardon for my behaviour of last night . What else should I want to do , in God 's name !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Dryly .</stage>I see , you 've slept on it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Laid awake on it .<stage>Fiercely .</stage>Do I look as if I 'd slept the sleep of a healthy infant ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know anything about infants , I am happy to say , healthy or ailing ; but certainly your treatment of Madame de Chaumié was atrocious .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Brutal , savage , inhuman !<stage>Halting and extending his arms .</stage>And what 's been her fault ? She 's dared to love me eagerly , impetuously , uncontrollably — me , a conceited , egotistical fellow who is no more worth her devotion than the pompous beast who opens her father 's front-door ! And because , out of her love , she commits a heedless , impulsive act which deals a blow at my rotten pride , I slap her face and turn my back upon her , and suffer her to leave my rooms as though she 's a charwoman detected in prigging silver from my cash-box !<stage>Clasping his brow and groaning .</stage>Oh —!<stage>In sudden fury at seeing ROOPE thoughtfully examining his hat .</stage>Damn it , Robbie , stop fiddling with your hat or you 'll drive me crazy !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He sits on the settee on the left and rests his head on his fists . ROOPE hastily deposits his hat on the smoking-table .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Approaching PHILIP coldly .</stage>I was considering , dear excellent friend — but perhaps in your present state of irritability ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Holding out his hand penitently .</stage>Shut up !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Presenting PHILIP with two fingers .</stage>I was considering — when you almost sprang at my throat — I was considering that it is n't at all unlikely that Madame de Chaumié 's frame of mind is a trifle less inflexible this morning . She has slept — or laid awake — on the events of last night too , recollect .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Raising his head .</stage>Having been kicked out of this place a few hours ago , her affection for me revives with the rattle of the milk-cans !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Evasively .</stage>At any rate , she must be conscious that you were smarting under provocation . She confessed as much during our talk .<stage>Magnanimously .</stage>Even I admit you had provocation .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>That never influenced a woman , Robbie . Besides , I 've insulted this one before — grossly insulted her , in the old days in Paris ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>Ancient history ! My advice is — since you invite it — my advice is that you write her a letter ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>I 've composed half-a-dozen already .<stage>Pointing to a waste-paper basket by the writing-table .</stage>The pieces are in that basket .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>No , no ; not a highly-wrought performance . Simply a line , asking her to receive you .<stage>PHILIP rises listlessly .</stage>Send it along by messenger .<stage>With growing enthusiasm .</stage>Look here ! I 'll take it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gloomily , his hand on Roope 's shoulder .</stage>Ho , ho ! You — you indefatigable old Cupid !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking at his watch .</stage>Quarter-past-ten .<stage>Excitedly .</stage>Phil , I bet you a hundred guineas —<stage>correcting himself</stage>er — well — five pounds — I bet you five pounds I 'm with you again , with a favourable reply , before twelve !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Clapping ROOPE on the back .</stage>
      <l>Done !</l>
      <stage>Crossing to the writing-table .</stage>
      <l>At the worst , I 've earned a fiver .</l>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>As PHILIP sits at the table and takes a sheet of paper and an envelope from a drawer .</stage>May I suggest ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Dipping his pen in the ink .</stage>Fire away , old chap .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Seeking for inspiration by gazing at the ceiling .</stage>H 'm —<stage>Dictating .</stage>“ Forgive me . I forgive you . When may I come to you ? ”<stage>To PHILIP .</stage>Not another word .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>As he writes .</stage>By George , you 've got the romantic touch , Robbie ! If you 'd been a literary bloke , what sellers you 'd have written !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Behind the smoking-table , smoothing his hair complacently .</stage>Funny , your remark . As a matter of fact , I used to dabble a little in pen-and-ink as a young man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Reading , a tender ring in his voice .</stage>“ Forgive me . I forgive you . When may I come to you ? ”<stage>Adding his signature .</stage>“ Philip . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>Admirable !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Folding and enclosing the note — catching some of ROOPE 's hopefulness .</stage>In the meantime I 'll array myself in my Sunday-best —<stage>moistening the envelope</stage>on the chance ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p>Do ; at once .<stage>Putting on his hat .</stage>She may summon you by telephone ——</p>

     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Addressing the envelope .</stage>She gave me a scarf-pin yesterday — such a beauty .<stage>Softly .</stage>I 'll wear it .<stage>Rising and giving the note to ROOPE .</stage>Bless you , old boy !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>ROOPE pockets the note , grasps PHILIP 's hand hurriedly , and bustles to the vestibule door .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>My quickest way is the Tube to Bayswater , and then a taxi across the</l>

    <stage>He has entered the vestibule — omitting to close the door in his haste — and has opened the outer door when PHILIP calls to him .</stage>

     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Standing behind the smoking-table — with a change of manner .</stage>Robbie ——</p>

     <p>Hey ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Robbie —<stage>ROOPE returns to PHILIP reluctantly , leaving the outer door open .</stage>Oh , Robbie —<stage>gripping ROOPE 's arm</stage>how I boasted to you of my triumph — my grand victory ! How I swaggered and bellowed , and crowed over you ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Fidgeting to get away .</stage>Yes , but we wo n't discuss that now , Phil ——</p>

     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Wonderingly .</stage>Done with it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>My career as a writing-man . It 's finished .<stage>Hanging his head .</stage>I 'm sorry to break faith with her people ; but she may take me , if she will , on her own terms — a poor devil who has proved a duffer at his job , and who is content henceforth to be nothing but her humble slave and dependant .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Energetically .</stage>My dear Phil , for heaven 's sake , do n't entertain such a notion ! Abandon your career just when you 're making a noise in the world ——!</p>

    <stage>A moment earlier , SIR TIMOTHY BARRADELL has appeared in the vestibule , trying , in the dim light there , to decipher the name on the outer door . Hearing the sound of voices , he turns and reveals himself .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking into the room and encountering ROOPE .</stage>Roope !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>As they shake hands — astonished .</stage>Dear excellent friend , what a surprise !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p>Ah , do n't flatter yourself you 're the only early riser in London !<stage>Seeing PHILIP .</stage>Mr. Mackworth —<stage>advancing</stage>I found your door open and I took the liberty ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Meeting him in the middle of the room .</stage>Sir Timothy Barradell , is n't it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p>It is .<stage>They shake hands , cordially on SIR TIMOTHY 's part , with more formality on PHILIP 's .</stage>It 's an unceremonious hour for a call , but if you 'd spare me five minutes ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Civilly .</stage>Pray sit down .<stage>Joining ROOPE at the entrance to the vestibule .</stage>Robbie has to run away ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROOPE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Diplomatically .</stage>
      <l>Ca n't stay another moment .</l>
      <stage>Waving a hand to SIR TIMOTHY .</stage>
      <l>Au revoir , dear Sir Timothy !</l>

     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laying his hat upon the settee on the right and taking off his gloves .</stage>So long !<stage>PHILIP and ROOPE stare at SIR TIMOTHY , whose back is towards them . ROOPE gives PHILIP an inquiring look , which PHILIP answers by a shrug and a shake of the head ; and then PHILIP lets ROOPE out and comes back into the room . SIR TIMOTHY turns to him .</stage>I 'm afraid you think I 'm presuming on a very slight acquaintance , Mr. Mackworth ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Shutting the vestibule door .</stage>Not in the least .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p>Anyhow I 'll not waste more of your valuable time than I can help .<stage>PHILIP points to the settee and the two men sit , Sir Timothy on the settee , PHILIP in the chair by the smoking-table . SIR TIMOTHY inspects the toes of his boots .</stage>Mr. Mackworth , I — I wo n't beat about the bush — it 's a delicate subject I 'm approaching you on .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Leaning back in his chair .</stage>Really ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p>An extremely delicate subject —<stage>raising his eyes</stage>Madame de Chaumié .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Madame de Chaumié ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p>In the first place , I suppose you 're aware that I had the temerity to propose marriage to the lady in the summer of this year ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I 'm aware of it . Madame de Chaumié informed me of the circumstance .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Nodding .</stage>She would ; she would .<stage>Straightening himself .</stage>Well , Mr. Mackworth , while I was abroad I heard from various sources that you had become a pretty regular visitor at the house of her parents , and that you and she were to be seen together occasionally in the secluded spots of Kensington Gardens ; and I naturally inferred that it was yourself she 'd had the good taste to single out from among her numerous suitors .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a smile .</stage>I 'd rather you did n't put it in that way , Sir Timothy ; but I guessed yesterday that the facts of the case had reached you through some channel or other .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p>Yesterday ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>When Robbie Roope brought me your kind greetings .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p>Ah , that 's nice of you !<stage>Constrainedly .</stage>That 's — nice of you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Changing his position and unbending .</stage>But tell me ! I do n't know yet what you have to say to me about Madame de Chaumié — but why should you find it embarrassing to speak of her to me ?<stage>Gently .</stage>We 're men of the world , you and I ; and it is n't the rule of life that the prize always goes to the most deserving .<stage>With animation .</stage>“ And in the world , as in the school , I 'd say , how fate may change and shift ; The prize be sometimes with the fool , The race not always to the swift . The strong may yield , the good may fall , The great man be a vulgar clown , The knave be lifted over all , The kind cast pitilessly down . ” So sang one of the noblest gentlemen who have ever followed my calling !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>There is a brief silence , and then SIR TIMOTHY rises abruptly and walks to the fireplace . PHILIP looks after him , perplexed .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Facing the fire .</stage>Mr. Mackworth ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Eh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p>I saw Bertram Filson last night — her brother .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pricking up his ears .</stage>You did ? Where ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p>At the club — the Junior Somerset . He came in late , looking a bit out of gear , and ate a mouthful of dinner and drank a whole bottle of Pommery ; and afterwards he joined me in the smoking-room and — and was exceedingly communicative .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Attentively .</stage>Oh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p>I did n't encourage him to babble —<stage>turning</stage>‘ twas he that insisted on confiding to me what had occurred ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Occurred ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p>That you and Madame de Chaumié had had a serious difference , and that there 's small prospect of its being bridged over .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Glaring .</stage>Oh , he confided that to you , did he , Sir Timothy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p>He did .</p>

     <lg>
      <stage>Rising and pacing up and down on the left .</stage>
      <l>And what the devil does</l>
      <l>Filson mean by gossiping about me at a club — me and my relations with</l>
      <l>Madame de Chaumié !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Advancing a little .</stage>Ah , do n't be angry ! The champagne he 'd drunk had loosened his tongue . And then , I 'm a friend of the family ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Infernal puppy !</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Of course .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Sir Timothy</speaker>
     <p><stage>Mildly .</stage>Well , whether young Filson 's a puppy or not , now perhaps you begin to appreciate my motive for intruding on you ?</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>

     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taking a cigarette from the box on the table .</stage>Mr. Mackworth , if Filson 's prognostications as to the result of the quarrel between you and his sister are fulfilled , it 's my intention , after a decent interval , to renew my appeal to her to marry me .<stage>Striking a match .</stage>Is that clear ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Perfectly .<stage>Stiffly .</stage>But all the same , I 'm still at a loss ——</p>

     <p><stage>Lighting his cigarette .</stage>At a loss , are you !<stage>Warmly .</stage>You 're at a loss to understand that I 'm not the sort of man who 'd steal a march upon another where a woman 's concerned , and take advantage of his misfortunes in a dirty manner !<stage>Coming to PHILIP .</stage>Mackworth — I 'll drop the Mister , if you 've no objection — Mackworth , I promise you I wo n't move a step till I have your assurance that your split with Madame de Chaumié is a mortal one , and that the coast is open to all comers . That 's my part o ’ the bargain , and I expect you on your side to treat me with equal fairness and frankness .<stage>Offering his hand .</stage>You will ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>My dear Sir Timothy — my dear Barradell —<stage>shaking SIR TIMOTHY 's hand heartily .</stage>you 're the most chivalrous fellow I 've ever met !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Walking away .</stage>Ah , go on now !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Following him .</stage>I apologize sincerely for being so curt .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p>Do n't mention it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>It 's true , Ottoline and I have had a bad fall out .</l>
      <stage>Keenly .</stage>
      <l>Did</l>
      <l>Filson give you any particulars ——?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p>I gathered ‘ twas something arising out of a book of yours ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Y-y-yes ; a silly affair in which I was utterly in the wrong . I lost my accursed temper — made a disgraceful exhibition of myself .<stage>Touching SIR TIMOTHY 's arm .</stage>I will be quite straight with you , Barradell — Robbie Roope has just gone to her with a note from me . I do n't want to pain you ; but Robbie and I hope that , after a night 's rest —<stage>The bell rings in the vestibule .</stage>Excuse me — my servant is n't in .<stage>He goes into the vestibule , leaving the door open . SIR TIMOTHY picks up his hat . On opening the outer door , PHILIP confronts OTTOLINE .</stage>Otto ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>In the doorway , giving him both her hands .</stage>
      <l>Are you alone ,</l>
      <l>Philip ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Drawing her into the vestibule , his eyes sparkling .</stage>No .<stage>With a motion of his head .</stage>Sir Timothy Barradell ——</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>OTTOLINE passes PHILIP and enters the room , holding out her hand to SIR TIMOTHY . Her eyes are black-rimmed from sleeplessness ; but whatever asperity she has displayed overnight has disappeared , and she is again full of softness and charm .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>Sir Tim !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Shutting the outer door — breathing freely .</stage>Kind of Sir Timothy to look me up , is n't it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>To SIR TIMOTHY .</stage>Vous êtes un vaurien ! When did you return ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Who has flung his cigarette into the grate — crestfallen .</stage>The day before yesterday .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>Then I must n't scold you for not having been to see us yet .<stage>Wonderingly .</stage>You find time to call on Mr. Mackworth , though !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>With a gulp .</stage>
      <l>I — I was on my way to my solicitors , who are in</l>
      <l>Raymond Buildings , and I remembered that I knew Mackworth years ago ——</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Loitering near the vestibule door , impatient for SIR TIMOTHY 's departure .</stage>When I was a rollicking man-about-town , eh , Barradell !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Retaining OTTOLINE 's hand — to her , earnestly .</stage>
      <l>My dear Madame de</l>

     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>Yes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Bracing himself .</stage>
      <l>A little bird brought the news to me shortly after</l>
      <l>I left England .</l>
      <stage>She lowers her eyes .</stage>
      <l>I — I congratulate you and</l>
      <l>Mackworth — I congratulate you from the core of my heart .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a quiet voice .</stage>Thank you , dear Sir Timothy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p>May you both be as happy as you deserve to be , and even happier !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laughing .</stage>Ha , ha , ha !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Squeezing her hand .</stage>Good-bye for the present .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smilingly .</stage>Good-bye .<stage>He passes her and joins PHILIP . Unseen by OTTOLINE — who proceeds to loosen her coat at the settee on the right — PHILIP again gives SIR TIMOTHY a vigorous hand-shake . SIR TIMOTHY responds to it disconsolately , and is following PHILIP into the vestibule when he hears OTTOLINE call to him .</stage>Sir Tim !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Turning .</stage>Hallo !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Lightly .</stage>Is your car here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Brightening .</stage>It is .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>You may give me a lift to Bond Street , if your business with your lawyers wo n't keep you long .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Emphatically .</stage>It will not .<stage>Beaming .</stage>I told you a lie . I 've no business with my lawyers . I came here expressly to improve my acquaintance with the man who 's to be your husband , and for no other purpose .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They all laugh merrily .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>Ha , ha , ha !<stage>To SIR TIMOTHY .</stage>Wait for me in South Square , then . I sha'n ' t be many minutes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIR TIMOTHY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Going into the vestibule .</stage>Ah , I 'd wait an eternity !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PHILIP and SIR TIMOTHY shake hands once more , and then PHILIP lets SIR TIMOTHY out .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>As he shuts the outer door .</stage>By George , he 's a splendid chap !<stage>He comes back into the room , closes the vestibule door , and advances to OTTOLINE and stands before her humbly .</stage>Oh , Ottoline — oh , my dear girl ! Shall I go down on my knees to you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a subdued tone .</stage>If you do , I shall have to kneel to you , Phil .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Slowly folding her in his arms .</stage>Ah ! Ah ! Ah !<stage>In her ear .</stage>What a night I 've spent !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Almost inaudibly .</stage>And I !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He seats her upon the settee on the right and sits beside her , linking his hand in hers .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>How merciful this is of you ! I 've just sent you a letter by Robbie Roope , begging you to see me ; you 've missed him .<stage>Smiling .</stage>It is n't as eloquent as some I started writing at five o'clock this morning . Would you like to hear it ?<stage>She nods . He recites his note tenderly .</stage>“ Forgive me . I forgive you . When may I come to you ? ” That 's all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>Is n't that eloquent , Phil ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling again .</stage>It 's concise — and as long as you forgive me —<stage>eyeing her with a shadow of fear</stage>you 're sure you 've forgiven me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>Sure .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Persistently .</stage>Without reserve ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>Should I be here —<stage>indicating their proximity</stage>and here — if I had n't ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pressing her hand to his lips ardently , and then freeing her shoulders from her coat .</stage>Take this off ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gently resisting .</stage>Poor Sir Timothy ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>In high spirits .</stage>Oh , a little exercise wo n't do Sir Timothy any harm !<stage>Helping her to slip her arms out of her coat .</stage>Dash it , you might have let me escort you to Bond Street !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>No , no ; your work ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>His brow clouding .</stage>W-w-work ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>You must n't lose your morning 's work .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>There is a short pause , and then he rises and moves a few steps away from her . With an impassive countenance , she fingers the buttons of her gloves .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Stroking the pattern of the carpet with his foot .</stage>Otto ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking up .</stage>Yes , Phil ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>I asked Robbie to tell you , if he had the opportunity , that I 've decided to make my farewell salaam to authorship . I 'm no good at it ; I 'm a frost ; I realize it at last . I 've had my final whack on the jaw ; I 've fought — how many rounds ?— and now I take the count and slink out of the ring , beat .<stage>Producing his keys , he goes to the cabinet on the right , unlocks it , and selects from several cardboard portfolios one which he carries to the writing-table . While he is doing this , OTTOLINE — still with an expressionless face — rises and moves to the left , where she stands watching him . He opens the portfolio and , with a pained look , handles the sheets of manuscript in it .</stage>Ha ! You and I have often talked over this , have n't we , Otto ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Calmly .</stage>Often .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taking the manuscript from the portfolio — thoughtfully .</stage>It was to have been — oh , such an advance on my previous stuff — kindlier , less strenuous , more urbane ! Success — success !— had sweetened the gall in me !<stage>Glancing at a partly covered page .</stage>Here 's where I broke off yesterday .<stage>With a shrug .</stage>In every man 's life there 's a chapter uncompleted , in one form or another !<stage>Throwing the manuscript into the portfolio .</stage>Pst ! Get back to your hole ; I 'll burn you later on .<stage>He rejoins her . She half turns from him , averting her head .</stage>So end my pitiful strivings and ambitions !<stage>Laying his hand on her shoulder .</stage>Ah , it 's a miserable match you 're making , Ottoline ! My two-hundred-a-year will rig me out suitably , and provide me with tobacco ; and the dribblets coming to me from my old books — through the honest publishers I deserted for Mr . Titterton !— the dribblets coming from my old books will enable me to present you with a nosegay on the anniversaries of our wedding-day , and — by the time your hair 's white — to refund you the money Titterton 's had from you . And there — with a little fame unjustly won , which , thank God , ‘ ll soon die !— there you have the sum of my possessions !<stage>Seizing her arms and twisting her round .</stage>Oh , but I 'll be your mate , my dear — your loyal companion and protector — comrade and lover ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He is about to embrace her again , but she keeps him off by placing her hands against his breast .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Steeling herself .</stage>Phil ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Unsuspectingly .</stage>Eh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>I arrived at a decision during the night too , Phil .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Yes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>Do n't — do n't loathe me .<stage>Shaking her head gravely .</stage>I am not going to marry you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Staring at her .</stage>You 're not going to — marry me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>No , Philip .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>After another pause .</stage>You — you 're overwrought , Otto ; you 've had no sleep . Neither of us has had any sleep ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , but I 'm quite clearheaded ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Bewildered .</stage>Why , just now you said you 'd forgiven me — repeated it ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>I do repeat it . If I 've anything to forgive , I forgive you a thousand times ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>And you allowed me to — to take you in my arms ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>You shall take me in your arms again , Phil , once more , before we part , if you wish to . I 'm not a girl , though you call me one ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sternly .</stage>Look here ! You do n't imagine for an instant that I shall accept this ! You ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>Ssh ! Try not to be hasty ; try to be reasonable . Listen to me ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>You — you mean me to understand that , in consequence of this wretched</l>
      <l>Titterton affair , you 've changed your mind , and intend to chuck me !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I mean you to understand that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Turning from her indignantly .</stage>Oh ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sitting in the chair by the smoking-table .</stage>Philip — Philip —<stage>He hesitates , then seats himself on the settee opposite to her . She speaks with great firmness and deliberation .</stage>Philip , while you were lying awake last night , or walking about your room , did n't you — think ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hotly .</stage>Think ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>No , no — soberly , steadily , searchingly . Evidently not , cher ami !</l>
      <stage>Bending forward .</stage>
      <l>Phil , after what has happened , can n't you see me as</l>
      <l>I really am ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>As you — are ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>An incurably vulgar woman . An incurably common , vulgar woman . Nobody but a woman whose vulgarity is past praying for could have conceived such a scheme as I planned and carried out with that man Clifford Titterton — nobody . This — how shall I term it ?— this refinement of mine is merely on the surface . We women are like the — what 's the name of the little reptile ?— the chameleon , is n't it ? We catch the colour of our surroundings . But what we were , we continue to be — in the grain . The vulgar-minded Ottoline Filson , who captivated , and disgusted , you in Paris is before you at this moment . The only difference is that then she was a natural person , and now she plays les grands rôles .<stage>Sitting upright and pressing her temples .</stage>Oh , I have fooled myself as well as you , Phil — deluded myself ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>You 're dog-tired , Otto . Your brain 's in a fever . All you 've done , you 've done from your love for me , my dear — your deep , passionate love ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Wincing .</stage>Passionate love — parfaitement !<stage>Looking at him .</stage>But that feeling 's over , Phil .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Over ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Simply .</stage>I shall always love you — always — always ; but my passion exhausted itself last night . For months it has borne me along on a wave . It was that that swept me to the door of Titterton 's office in Charles Street , Adelphi ; it was strong enough to drive me to any length . But last night , in those dreadful small hours , the wave beat itself out , and threw me up on to the rocks , and left me shivering — naked — ashamed —<stage>drawing a deep breath</stage>ah , but in my right senses !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She unbuttons her left-hand glove , rolls the hand of the glove over her wrist , and takes her engagement-ring from her finger .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Aghast .</stage>Otto ! Otto ! What are you doing ! What are you doing !<stage>She lays the ring carefully upon the smoking-table and rises and walks away . He rises with her , following her .</stage>To-morrow — when you 've had some sleep — to-morrow ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>Never . Do n't deceive yourself , Philip .<stage>Going to the fireplace .</stage>If anything was needed to strengthen my resolution , the announcement you 've just made would supply it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>On the left .</stage>Announcement ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>With regard to your literary work .<stage>Turning to him .</stage>Ne voyez-vous pas ! I have begun to degrade you already !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Consciously .</stage>Degrade me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>Degrade you . If I had n't come into your life again , you would have accepted your reverse — your failure to gain popularity by your latest book — as you 've accepted similar disappointments — with a shrug and a confident snap of your fingers .<stage>Advancing .</stage>But I 've humbled you — bruised your spirit — shaken your courage ; and now you express your willingness — you !— to throw your pen aside , and tack yourself to my skirts , and to figure meekly for the rest of your existence as “ Mrs. Mackworth 's husband ” !<stage>At the nearer end of the writing-table .</stage>Mon Dieu ! This is what I have brought you to !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Biting his lip .</stage>You — you would n't have me profit by the advertisement I 've got out of “ The Big Drum , ” Ottoline —<stage>ironically</stage>the finest advertisement I could wish for , according to Robbie ! You would n't have me sink as low as that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>You can write under an alias — a nom de plume — until you 've won your proper place ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Uneasily .</stage>Oh , well — perhaps — by-and-by — when we had settled down , you and I — and things had adjusted themselves ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , when you 'd grown sick and weary of your new environment , and had had time to reflect on the horrid trick I 'd employed to get hold of you , and had learned to despise me for it , you 'd creep back to your desk and make an effort to pick up the broken threads !<stage>Coming to the settee on the right .</stage>Eh bien ! Do you know what would happen then , Phil ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>W-w-what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Intensely .</stage>I should puff you , under the rose — quietly pull the strings — use all the influence I could rake up ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>No , no ——</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>I should . It 's in my blood . I could n't resist it . Whether you wrote as Jones , or Smith , or Robinson , you 'd find Jones , Smith , or Robinson artfully puffed and paragraphed and thrust under people 's noses in the papers . I 'm an incurably vulgar woman , I tell you !<stage>Snatching at her coat — harshly .</stage>Ah , que je me connais ; que je me connais !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She fumbles for the arm-holes of her coat . He goes to her quickly and they stand holding the coat between them and looking at each other .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>After a silence .</stage>You — you 're determined ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>Determined .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>You — you can n't be !</p>

     <p>I am — I swear I am .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>After a further silence .</stage>Then it is — as you said last night ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>What did I say last night ? I forget .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a husky voice .</stage>C'est fini — après tout !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Inclining her head .</stage>C'est fini — après tout .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Bitterly .</stage>Ho ! Ho , ho , ho !<stage>Another pause .</stage>So when — when April comes — we — we sha'n ' t ——!</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Lowering her eyes — all gentleness again .</stage>We sha'n ' t walk under the trees in the Champs-Elysées , Phil ——</p>

     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Nor in the Allée de Longchamp — where we ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>No , nor in the Allée de Longchamp .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Releasing her coat and thrusting his hands into his trouser-pockets .</stage>
      <l>Somebody else 'll gulp the milk at the Café d'Armenonville ——!</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>And at the Pré-Catalan ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>And there 'll be no one to gaze sentimentally at my old windows in the</l>
      <l>Rue Soufflot ——</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Softly .</stage>Quarante-trois bis .<stage>Sighing .</stage>No one .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a hollow laugh .</stage>Ha , ha , ha ! C'est fini — après tout !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Firmly .</stage>C'est fini — après tout .<stage>She holds out her coat to him and he helps her into it . Suddenly , while her back is turned to him , he utters a guttural cry and grips her shoulders savagely . She turns in surprise , her hand to her shoulder .</stage>Oh , Phil ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pointing at her .</stage>I see ! I see ! I see the end of it ! You 'll marry Barradell ! You 'll marry the fellow who 's cooling his heels down below in South Square !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Placidly , fastening her coat .</stage>I may .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Choking .</stage>Oh ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>I may , if I marry at all — and he bothers any more about me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Stamping up and down .</stage>
      <l>Bacon Barradell ! Bacon Barradell ! The wife of</l>
      <l>Bacon Barradell !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a sad smile .</stage>He has social aims ; a vulgar , pushing woman would be a serviceable partner for Sir Tim .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Oh ! Oh —!<stage>Dropping on to the settee on the left and burying his face in his hands .</stage>Ho , well , more power to him ! He can sell his bacon ; I — I can n't sell my books !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Again there is a silence , and then , putting on her left-hand glove , she goes to PHILIP and stands over him compassionately .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p>Mon pauvre Philippe , it 's you , not I , who will take another view of things to-morrow .<stage>He makes a gesture of dissent .</stage>Ah , come , come , come ! You have never loved me as I have loved you . Unconsciously — without perceiving it — one may be half a poseuse ; but at least I 've been sincere in my love for you , and in hungering to be your wife .<stage>Giving him her right hand .</stage>You 're the best I 've ever known , dear ; by far the best I 've ever known .<stage>He presses her hand to his brow convulsively .</stage>But when we had our talk in South Audley Street , how did you serve me ? You insisted on my waiting — waiting ; I who had cherished your image in my mind for years ! You guessed I should n't have patience — you almost prophesied as much ; but still — I was to wait !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Inarticulately .</stage>Oh , Otto !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Withdrawing her hand .</stage>What did that show , Phil ? It showed — as your compromise with mother and Dad showed afterwards — that the success of the book you were engaged upon came first with you ; that marrying me was to be only an incident in your career ; that you did n't love me sufficiently to bend your pride or vary your programme a jot .<stage>He gets to his feet , startled , dumbfoundered . He attempts to speak , but she checks him .</stage>H'sh ! H'sh ! I 'm scolding you ; but , for your sake , I would n't have it otherwise . Now that I 'm sane and cool , I would n't have it otherwise .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Struggling for words — thickly .</stage>Ottoline — Ottoline —<stage>his voice dying away</stage>I ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTTOLINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taking his hands in hers .</stage>Good-bye . Do n't come downstairs with me . Let me leave you sitting at your table , at work — at work on that incomplete chapter . We shall tumble up against one another , I dare say , at odd times , but this is the last we shall see of each other dans l'intimité ; and I want to print on my memory the sight of you —<stage>pointing to the writing-table</stage>there — keeping your flag flying .<stage>Putting her arms round him — in a whisper .</stage>Keep your flag flying , Philip ! Do n't — do n't sulk with your art , and be false to yourself , because a trumpery woman has fretted and disturbed you . Keep your flag flying —<stage>kissing him</stage>my — my dear hero !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She untwines her arms and steps back . Slowly , with his hands hanging loosely , and his chin upon his breast , PHILIP passes her and goes to the writing-table . There , dully and mechanically , he takes the unfinished page of manuscript from the portfolio , arranges it upon the blotting-pad and , seating himself at the table , picks up his pen . Very softly OTTOLINE opens the vestibule door , gives PHILIP a last look over her shoulder , and enters the vestibule , closing the door behind her . There is a pause , during which PHILIP sits staring at his inkstand , and then the outer door slams . With an exclamation , PHILIP drops his pen , leaps up , and rushes to the vestibule door .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p>Otto ! Otto !<stage>Loudly .</stage>Ottoline ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>With his hand on the door-handle , he wavers , his eyes shifting wildly to and from the writing-table . Then , with a mighty effort , he pulls himself together , strides to the smoking-table , and loads and lights his pipe . Puffing at his pipe fiercely , he reseats himself before his manuscript and , grabbing his pen , forces himself to write . He has written a word or two when he falters — stops — and lays his head upon his arm on the table .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PHILIP</speaker>
     <p><stage>His shoulders heaving .</stage>Oh , Otto — Otto ——!</p>
