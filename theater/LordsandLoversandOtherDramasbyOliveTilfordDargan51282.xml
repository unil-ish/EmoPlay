     <p>This , sir ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pem</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Ay , that is it .</l>
      <l>‘ Twas Henry Second , grandsire of this Henry ,</l>
      <l>Gave me that packet . Sir , you know the tale</l>
      <l>Of princess Adelais who journeyed here</l>
      <l>As the betrothed of Richard , Henry 's son .</l>
      <l>Alack , she never was his bride . Some say</l>
      <l>That Henry loved her ... I know not ... but she</l>
      <l>Returned to France , her reason wandering .</l>
      <l>“ If she recover , ” said the king to me ,</l>
      <l>“ Give her this packet ; should she die , break seal</l>
      <l>And learn what you shall do . ” She did not die ,</l>
      <l>Nor can I say she lives , so sad her state .</l>
      <l>Her age was bare fifteen when she left England ,</l>
      <l>Her face a lily and her eyes a flood ;</l>
      <l>She now must be midway her fifth decade ,</l>
      <l>A time , I 've heard , when subtle changes work</l>
      <l>Within the mind . A beauteous soul ! O God ,</l>
      <l>Restore her now , or lift her e'en to thee !</l>
      <l>... Take you the packet , and the king 's command .</l>
      <l>But first your oath . Deceit has sapped my faith</l>
      <l>So oft I could believe the devil himself</l>
      <l>Wears gown and mitre . Peter des Roches , will you</l>
      <l>Be true ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Win</speaker>
     <p>I swear by Heaven .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pem</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>That is done ,</l>
      <l>As well as't can be done . Call in my son</l>
      <l>And Albemarle .</l>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Pem</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Now let us talk</l>
      <l>Of England . O , this fleet , this fleet , rigged out</l>
      <l>By warlike Constance in monk Louis ’ name !</l>
      <l>I see it nearing now , leaping the waves ,</l>
      <l>On , on , and none to meet it ! Cowards all .</l>
      <l>What do ye here , ye three , loitering about</l>
      <l>A sick man 's bed ? A man almost a corpse .</l>
      <l>I would not have a servant waste himself</l>
      <l>To give me drink while England needs his sword .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Rich</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>My father lord , we have our men abroad</l>
      <l>Rousing the country for a stout defence .</l>
      <l>To meet the French with our poor ships were madness ;</l>
      <l>But let them land we 'll give them such a rap ——</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pem</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>What ? Land your enemy ? O , fools and cowards !</l>
      <l>... I 've given my life for England . Now you 'll cast</l>
      <l>My heart-dear bargain into Louis ’ hand</l>
      <l>As ‘ twere a snood slipped from an easy maid .</l>
      <l>Fool man ! to puff his days out jousting Fate ,</l>
      <l>Who waits but his bare death to start her mock</l>
      <l>Of horrid pleasantries . Then does she make</l>
      <l>Dice of the miser 's bones , carousal cups</l>
      <l>Of the ascetic 's skull , a hangman 's scoff</l>
      <l>Of clerics ’ prayer-fed sons ; and proudest sires ,</l>
      <l>Who sentried their blue blood , peer back through dust</l>
      <l>To see all Babylon pour to their line .</l>
      <l>And now she 'll bid my war-ghost eyes behold</l>
      <l>The land held with my life become a field</l>
      <l>For foes at holiday !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>Compose yourself , your grace .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>Pem</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Gualo has come , but where is he will set</l>
      <l>This power its task , and play it for this isle ?</l>
      <l>I can not say that wisdom dies with me ,</l>
      <l>But I could wish more proof of sager mind</l>
      <l>Than e'er I 've had from this small audience .</l>
      <l>Lord Bishop , you are left custodian</l>
      <l>Of Henry 's ripening youth .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <lg>
      <l>Nor shall I fail</l>
      <l>To be your worthy heir in this high duty ,</l>
      <l>For still I shall consult with your great spirit ,</l>
      <l>Praying your ghost be mover of my deeds .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pem</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I 've spoken to the king . He 'll give you love</l>
      <l>For love . But who shall be lord chancellor ?</l>
      <l>There 's little choice . And yet there 's one , De Burgh ,</l>
      <l>If camp and field could spare him ——</l>

     <lg>
      <l>By your good leave ,</l>
      <l>Age is no patent to respect and place</l>
      <l>If virtue go not with it . Whitened hairs</l>
      <l>Make honor radiant , but vice thereby</l>
      <l>Is viler still . Ay , there are some ——</l>

      <l>When death 's decay so blurs each fading sense</l>

      <l>‘ Tis now ten years since Margaret came from Scotland</l>
      <l>To be his charge . A pretty child — do you</l>

      <stage>Exit lady Albemarle</stage>
      <l>Art gone , my sister , and no word of love</l>
      <l>For one who looks on death ? It is the fear</l>
      <l>That keeps so constant with her makes her hard</l>
      <l>And unlike woman — unlike Margaret .</l>
      <l>... Last night the king was with her — and she swooned .</l>
      <l>But not for him . By Heaven , ‘ twas not for him !</l>

      <l>Are we not friends ? And if I came in hope</l>

      <l>I know none else would shed ——</l>

     <speaker>Mar</speaker>
     <p>Hear then . I will not wed the king .</p>

      <l>To cage my soul in circle of a court</l>
      <l>And fawn on turnkey humor for my life !</l>
      <l>Scotland is lost to me . I 'll not go there</l>
      <l>To meet my dangerous brother 's wrath . No , no !</l>
      <l>But there are forests — I can fly to them ,</l>
      <l>And dig my food from Nature 's generous earth ,</l>
      <l>Thrive on her berries , drink from her clear streams ,</l>
      <l>Sleep ‘ neath the royal coverlet of her leaves ,</l>
      <l>And make some honest friends ‘ mong her kind creatures</l>
      <l>That we call dumb because , forsooth , they speak</l>
      <l>By eye and touch and gibber not as we !</l>
      <l>... So silent , sir ? Come , will you not advise me ?...</l>
      <l>There was a day before the day of kings</l>
      <l>When maidens looked where'er their hearts had sped</l>
      <l>And found them mates who had no need of crowns</l>
      <l>To make them royal , and such a day the world</l>
      <l>May see again , but I , alack , must breathe</l>
      <l>The present time , and crave the help of state</l>
      <l>And craft and gold to get me married ! O ,</l>
      <l>The judgment angel gathering up our clay</l>
      <l>Will know this period by its broken hearts !</l>

The waves were runnin ’ high , and the brine in my face gave me such a spirit that in a minute my bonnet was off and I was singing at the top of my voice — O braw , braw knight , come down the glen And awa ’ to kirk wi ’ me ! And Heaven send us seven stout sons To fight for our king on the sea ! It 's a long ballad , but it 's out o ’ my mind now , and who should come up behind me but my man that was to be , and ‘ twas set then and there we must go to the kirk come Sunday . Ay , it got me a husband , but never a son , for only six months away he was drowned at sea — the very sea that I 'd sung so brave t-to ——</p>

      <l>The earl of Kent , who lately met his death ,</l>

      <l>Let him be made the great lord chancellor ,</l>

      <l>No , by the Lord ! At the first castle where</l>
      <l>You planned to stop I had my servants laid</l>
      <l>To take you prisoners . It stirs my blood</l>
      <l>That you should think I came to the bishopric</l>
      <l>By a fool 's wit . Now Rome is at my back ,</l>
      <l>And Henry king ! But I 'll make peace with you ,</l>
      <l>For I foresee a power in De Burgh</l>
      <l>That warns me not to scorn even traitor strength .</l>

       <l>We 'll call this council in the name of Rome ,</l>
       <l>To kill the canker in the bud of peace</l>
       <l>So lately ventured in the track of war ,</l>
       <l>And sound abroad that on this holy day</l>
       <l>All weapons , armor , and gross sign of blood</l>
       <l>Shall be laid by . I will persuade the king</l>
       <l>His dignity is touched to be so quick</l>
       <l>To fill his purse before he says his prayers ,</l>
       <l>And that ‘ tis wise to throw this goodly bait</l>
       <l>To hook the common love . Now to this meeting</l>
       <l>Let every prelate bear most righteous arms ,</l>
       <l>And every baron look well to his sword ;</l>
       <l>Then when the unsuspecting king appears ,</l>
       <l>Close companied no doubt by his new earl ,</l>
       <l>That mushroom minion we will dare accuse</l>
       <l>And crop his power as we prize our safety .</l>

      <l>In care of ‘ s Holiness , with the request</l>
      <l>That it be given her should she recover .</l>
      <l>The purport is — her child has lived to be</l>
      <l>A grace to manhood , but that he himself</l>
      <l>Approaches death , and from his worthy son ,</l>
      <l>Hubert de Burgh , she may in proper time</l>

      <l>With strongest Bedford as his ducal seat ;</l>

He likes my cookin ’ , as I 've had proof , and he looks so cunnin ’ at me lately I could swear he was fallin ’ in love all over again . And I 'm picking up my looks , I must say . Ay , there 's nothin ’ like a soft tongue for keepin ’ a woman young . I feel ‘ most like a lassie , though he did say some words at first that made my heart sore , not knowing me after ten years away . And he 's that handsome yet ,— since he 's shaved off the beard that got so between us I did n't know my own good man that married me in Dummerlie kirk on as sweet a Sunday morn as you ever see , and the priest in a new frock from Wappington , as the housekeeper told me herself — La , I forgot my lady !</p>

Lord , do n't cry , little chicken ! You are a soft one . Cryin ’ to think I 've lost such a jewel o ’ a lass , but I 'll tell you something to make you think better of it .

      <stage>A fawn comes to her from the wood . She fondles it</stage>
      <l>See , brother ! I would ope no book less pure</l>

      <l>So full of earth as mine ? I can love nothing</l>
      <l>But woods and streams , and these unspeaking things</l>
      <l>That reasonless may build no dream of God .</l>
      <l>My Henry , why this fear that if I go</l>
      <l>From this dear world I 'll come to it no more ?</l>

      <l>To bed with worms ; but this same love would be</l>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Vet</speaker>
      <p>Yes ... old . We may gather acorns in the woods , mother , but we shall never find any more flowers . Well enough . The trees would grow wrinkled with laughter to see an old man dancing beneath them . Eh — yes , let him stoop , and pick up brush .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Vet</speaker>
      <p>Because you served in the barin 's house and the mistress liked you . Just chance ! And then the barin died and Travinski got hold of everything .</p>

      <speaker>Cath</speaker>

     </sp>

      <p>Send an innocent lad out of his own country to be safe .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Cath</speaker>
      <p>He is to be a musician as well as a scholar . Berlin is the place . The Shepherd knows . He could not keep out of trouble at our universities . You know what you were in your youth , Petrovich .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Vet</speaker>
      <p>I wanted to be a scholar too . But they beat me back .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Cath</speaker>
      <p>You have been a good peasant . You might have been a poor scholar . And we have had the teachers . Do n't you remember the first night-class in our cottage , and the noble 's daughter who wore peasant clothes and taught grown men to read ? That was thirty years ago .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Vet</speaker>
      <p>And she went to Kara for it ... to the mines ... for teaching men to read .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p>But others came .</p>

      <p>God bless them ! We can all read our Bibles now . And the lad is going to a university .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Vet</speaker>
      <p>‘ Tis far , Berlin . I am old . The Shepherd is needed everywhere . He may go any time . Vasil ought to stay with his sister .</p>

      <p>Adrian wo n't like it . He says your mind must be free from — all that . Free for what , Vasil ? We want to be free only to do things .</p>

      <p>And were you glad , Vera ?</p>

      <p>No . I ran away .</p>

      <p><stage>Smiling</stage>I told Madam Korego it would never do to take you .</p>

      <p>A fine gentleman , all covered with gold lace .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Kore</speaker>
      <p>And he gave you a piece to weep over when you are only poor little madam Korelenko ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Vera</speaker>
      <p>A very great man — General Petrizoff !</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Adr</speaker>
      <p>No , little sister . Lay the table in the garden . It makes one hungry to walk from Petoff .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Vera</speaker>
      <p>So far ! Sit down , you bad little brother !<stage>Leads him , to the large chair , and goes toward kitchen</stage>In three minutes !<stage>Listens at door and says softly</stage>Uliana is gone .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Kore</speaker>
      <p>What of Petoff ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Adr</speaker>
      <p><stage>Looks about and sees Vasil at his book</stage>Vasil , lad , a cup of water from the garden well . The roads are unusually dusty for the first of June .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Exit Vasil , kitchen way</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Kore</speaker>
      <p>You are wrong , Adrian . It is time for him to know man 's work . This is not a day for dreamers .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Adr</speaker>
      <p>For dreamers , no ,— but a dreamer , yes . Can we not spare one to step out of the days to a place in the ages ? We shall die , indeed , if there is none to sing us .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Kore</speaker>
      <p>He must know his theme then .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Adr</speaker>
      <p>He shall know it ,— when he knows art so well that life can not tempt him to die . I will save his youth , his enthusiasm , and then ... he may please himself .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Kore</speaker>
      <p>No use . Our prisons are full of buried enthusiasms . He must take his fate with the rest of us . This is the world , not a fairy 's cockle-shell . You can n't save him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Adr</speaker>
      <p>I must . In him Heaven has given me back my own youth . I shall not surrender it a second time .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Kore</speaker>
      <p>He belongs to himself , and he will soon find out that he is a man and a Russian . But Petoff ? What did you find there ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Adr</speaker>
      <p>Despair , desolation , death . That is all they have gained by revolt .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Kore</speaker>
      <p>No ! They have gained the name of men . To have submitted to be stripped and turned bleeding under the skies would have proved them lower than beasts .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Enter Vetrova , right , with cup of water</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Vet</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>I begged the cup of Vasil . Let me die when I can not serve</l>
       <l>Adrian Lavrov .</l>

      <p><stage>Advancing to him and taking the cup</stage>Thank you , Petrovich . I would rather serve you .<stage>Drinks</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Vet</speaker>
      <p>Are we safe , Adrian Lavrov ? Is Lonz at peace ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Adr</speaker>
      <p>Yes , Petrovich . I have Prince Travinski 's word that we shall not be molested so long as we are patient under the law .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Kore</speaker>
      <p>The law ? Under robbery and the rod ! Patience under the foot of your master !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Adr</speaker>
      <p>The slave can always rise above the master by forgiving him . Go among our neighbors , Petrovich , and let them know they need fear nothing while they themselves keep the peace .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Vet</speaker>
      <p>Heaven , and the Shepherd of Lonz , be praised !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Places cup on table and goes out street door</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Kore</speaker>
      <p>You saw Travinski ? How did you manage it ? He has steadily refused to see any one from the people .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Adr</speaker>
      <p>And he refused to see me at first , but as I was coming away I met a lady who interceded for me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Kore</speaker>
      <p>His daughter ? The princess Sophie ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Adr</speaker>
      <p>No . Sophie Remon . One of the Red Cross workers .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Kore</speaker>
      <p>Remon ? I do n't know her .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Adr</speaker>
      <p>Her district is farther north , but she comes here occasionally .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Kore</speaker>
      <p>She must have great influence .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Adr</speaker>
      <p>Yes . I was surprised to meet her in the palace .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Kore</speaker>
      <p>Naturally . In the enemy 's camp . A spy on one side or the other .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Adr</speaker>
      <p><stage>Sternly</stage>I , too , was in the palace , Korelenko .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Kore</speaker>
      <p><stage>Looking at him closely , after a surprised start</stage>All right . I suppose she explained her presence there .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Adr</speaker>
      <p>I asked nothing . She is probably a friend of the princess .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Kore</speaker>
      <p>I hope not . She can n't be her friend and yours too .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Adr</speaker>
      <p>Why not ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Kore</speaker>
      <p>I learned to-day that the princess Sophie is one of Petrizoff 's spies . She has a wager with him , a luck-piece against a tiara , that she will secure evidence to convict you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Adr</speaker>
      <p>Petrizoff need not be at so much trouble . He can imprison me without evidence when he pleases .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Kore</speaker>
      <p>Not you . That may do for other poor devils , but you have friends all over Russia . It would make too much of a stir even for Petrizoff . He would have to show the papers ——</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Re-enter Vera , right</stage>

      <speaker>Vera</speaker>
      <p>Have you forgotten you were hungry ?</p>

     <stage>They go out , right , with Vera , as Vetrova and princess Sophie Travinski appear at street door . She wears a long gray ulster marked with a red cross , and a plain , drooping hat with veil</stage>

      <speaker>Vet</speaker>
      <p>As I 've told you , lady ,— with me , old Vetrova . Ten years since he came in at that door to be a son to me and Catherine .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Soph</speaker>
      <p>He has lived here ten years ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Vet</speaker>
      <p>Not all of that , for he is often called away . But he always comes back . ‘ Tis never too far to come back .<stage>Draws up the large chair</stage>Will you sit here , madam ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Soph</speaker>
      <p>You have a granddaughter ?<stage>Sitting</stage></p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Vet</speaker>
      <p>Little Vera ,— and a grandson , too . Twins , though not a bit alike , as you may see for yourself before you go . ‘ Twas Vasil , my grandson , who brought the Shepherd to us . He was just seven years old then , and a fine lad . We can say that about our grandchildren , ma'am . The Shepherd loved him at first sight , and a father he 's been to him ever since . His own father , my Andrei , died under the rod one bad year when taxes could n't be paid , and his wife — the little mother — died too when they brought him in . She dropped like that . But we do n't tell the children . They 'll not have to dig up graves for trouble .<stage>Going right</stage>I 'll let the Shepherd know you are here .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Soph</speaker>

      <p>But you will keep my secret ? It is important . No one must suspect that I am Sophie Travinski .</p>

      <p>I did nothing .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Adr</speaker>
      <p>Everything . The people are crazed out of their dulness . They fear new , unknown horrors . I did not know what might happen ; but the assurance of Prince Travinski will renew their endurance . That was what I needed — his word .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>Soph</speaker>
      <p><stage>Uneasily</stage>You can not need it . You who have such power over the people . ‘ Tis not because Travinski said it but because you repeat it that they believe . You are a great man , Adrian Lavrov .</p>

      <p>No . For Vera Vetrova . She is in danger .</p>

      <p>A friend of mine leaves for Odessa to-morrow to embark for America . Vera can travel with her , taking her maid 's passport . She will be safe until to-morrow . The officers ’ ball , and some other matters , will keep Petrizoff occupied . I will arrange everything and send for her in the morning .</p>

     <p>First , let me tell you that I am Petrizoff 's spy .<stage>He drops to a seat</stage>He wanted to convict you . You are so important , it seems , that proof from a high source was necessary . I offered to supply it .<stage>Smiles</stage>Do n't you see ? I was afraid some one else might be successful .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rising</stage>I see . You are only false to Petrizoff .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Soph</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hotly</stage>I am only his good angel . I have kept him from doing terrible things by not finding the means ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>Forgive me . I do n't understand yet . Why did you do this — for me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Soph</speaker>
     <p>You were doing a noble work .</p>

     <p>Adrian !<stage>He faces her . She stands in the light from the window</stage>You came to the Travinski palace two years ago . It was June , like this —<stage>motioning out</stage>— and sunset — like this . Do you remember ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>I remember .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Soph</speaker>
     <p>You talked to my father . I was in the room . You did not see me , a mere princess ,— but I saw you — heard you . I could not leave — I could not turn away . Your words were like new dreams to me .... And after that Petrizoff appealed to my father to furnish evidence against you . He consented because he feared your power over the peasants . I begged him to trust the matter to me , and it was then that I made the foolish wager with Petrizoff . My light manner deceived him , but all the time my heart was dying within me for fear I should fail .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p><stage>Falteringly</stage>Your highness ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Soph</speaker>
     <p>O , not that ! I have called you Adrian for two years .<stage>He is silent , and she continues</stage>The Red Cross work gave me opportunities to see you . At first perhaps I was only trying to save you — and win you . But now I know that I am true . I am ready to die for the things that you would die for , not for your sake but the things ’ sake . Though I do not love you less . My love has grown with my spirit . When we met this morning I dared to put into my eyes all that I felt . You looked as though you had suddenly met a being out of Heaven , but it was not Heaven 's light upon my face ; it was my love for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>Sophie ... let it be the light from Heaven , not poor human love .</p>

     <p><stage>Drawing back</stage>Have I — am I — mistaken ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>No . I love you as I have prayed never to love in my life .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Soph</speaker>
     <p>And I love you as I have prayed all my life I might love .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>There are greater things — than this .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Soph</speaker>
     <p>I know . It is because of those greater things that I love you .<stage>Touching him gently</stage>And how can love be anything but a help — a blessing ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>

    <stage>Moves from her in agitation , which he suppresses , and speaks steadily ] Years ago I gave myself to mankind . A poor gift , but the surrender was hard , for I loved myself and believed in giants , if not gods , who shoulder above the race . But the surrender was complete . And now shall I take another self in you ? One that I could never give up ?</stage>
    <stage>She is silent . A woman approaches without , moaning . Adrian goes to the door ] Anna ?</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Anna</speaker>
     <p><stage>Appearing at door</stage>My lad is dead , sir . He wanted to see you again , but there was none to send . Each is busy with his own .</p>

     <p>Dear Nikola ! God 's rest is his .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Anna</speaker>
     <p>Yes . Heaven is a good place for our children . ‘ Tis better with me than Uliana . Her Petrov may live , but he will never walk . Can you come to-night and sit a bit by the lad ? I 'm almost thinkin ’ he would know it , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>I will come , Anna .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Anna</speaker>
     <p>Just a bit . I would n't keep you from the living . God bless you , sir !<stage>Goes . Adrian remains in door until her footsteps die away , then returns to Sophie</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>You know what my work means . The daily offering up of the body to prison and death . That does not matter now , but if you were in danger , as my wife would always be , do you doubt that I would try to save you at the risk of all for which I have lived ? And I have lived for it because it was the one righteous way for me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Soph</speaker>
     <p>I should never come between you and your work .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>I gave up ambition — I would rather move with the multitude one step nearer the light than with my two hands catch at the sun . I gave up art — what right had I to retreat into the beautiful while my brothers lay blind without ? Burnish my spirit to reflect gleams beyond the stars , while children were without bread ? But love ? O , I thought God would spare me this !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Soph</speaker>
     <p>Adrian — you do n't understand — I should not be in your way — your work would be mine ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>O , you do n't understand — you can n't , for you are a woman , whose natural breath is the incense of sacrifice . But in me there is no angel . If you were mine , I would risk everything to hold you — one bit of rosy flesh that I might kiss !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Soph</speaker>
     <p><stage>Softly</stage>I know you better than that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>Even now I am trembling for you , thinking more of your safety than of the poor people who are waiting for me as their only hope . You must leave here at once — cease trying to protect me — what you have done for Vasil may arouse the suspicions of Petrizoff ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Soph</speaker>
     <p>He will not hear of it . I spoke to Orloff .<stage>Answering his look</stage>I can take care of myself , Adrian .<stage>Taking his hand</stage>It is you who need ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p><stage>Withdrawing his hand</stage>Do n't ! Who lets in love , lets in his master , and I must be free — free ! You will despise me , but that perhaps is the better way . O , I long to deceive myself , to say that it would make no difference , that I could see the chains fastened about you , see you dragged away , and go on unfalteringly with no dimming of the vision . But it would be a lie .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Soph</speaker>
     <p>The truth . You could do it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>No . And you would not want me to do it Forgive me . You do not believe it now , but you would want me to love you first .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Soph</speaker>
     <p>Yes . But I should not let you . You say yourself that sacrifice is woman 's breath . I could give up even my desire to be first . But why make a question of the impossible ? No woman could be first with you , Adrian .</p>

     <p>Why should she ? Is n't it enough that she has given herself to us for one day ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Vasil</speaker>
     <p>She has given herself to me forever — by saving my life . She may forget you and the others , but she can n't forget me , Adrian . O , I have been so happy to-day !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>To-day ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Vasil</speaker>
     <p>I have finished “ The Joy of the Stars . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p><stage>Exultantly</stage>Your sonata finished ? To-day !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Vasil</speaker>
     <p>You have been right , Adrian . This life shall not touch me . I could never understand it . When I think of it I grow blind — blind — blind ! I shall sing — just sing till my head goes off , nor ask why . The people are good , honest , work from light to dark , yet they starve , bleed , die . And I , who pray to harm nothing , I — this morning —<stage>stops , shudders , crosses to table , rear , lays his violin upon it , and sits despairingly . Adrian follows and puts his arm over the boy 's shoulders</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>That is over , lad . You will soon be in Berlin with your music , and you will forget . Think of it as a dream that will not come again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Vasil</speaker>
     <p>But it will be coming to others . Always somewhere there are people suffering , in prison , mad , tortured ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>You can not help them now , Vasil . And to let sympathy destroy your power for work will rob them of the joy you may bring them hereafter . Forget them for awhile that you may come again with help , not tears , that ease your heart rather than theirs .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Vasil</speaker>
     <p>No , I shall not forget — not for a minute — but I shall work and be blithe of soul , for what has the soul to do with the tearing of the heart , unless it be to show its free wings above it ? If I were imprisoned , racked , dying , I should want the music to go on , I should try even then to help it , to turn my cries into a song . That is why I can sing while they suffer — because happiness is the right thing — because I am ready to suffer while they sing ,— not because I forget . O , you can trust me , Adrian ! And<stage>with sudden appeal</stage>I want to be at the meeting to-night .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hastily</stage>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Vasil</speaker>
     <p>Yes , Adrian .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>You are too young .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Vasil</speaker>
     <p>As old as the morning star . Do not be afraid . Whatever touches me , nothing shall touch my song .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>Your song can be saved only with your life , Vasil , and this meeting is dangerous . In a few days you are going away . We will not uselessly waste your heart to-night .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Vasil</speaker>
     <p>I do not want to go just now , Adrian . Let me stay here a little longer . There is so much you can teach me yet .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling</stage>You make better music than I can dream . No , it is time to go .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Vasil</speaker>
     <p>But I want to stay !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quickly</stage>You must have no wishes .<stage>More gently</stage>Aside from your art .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Vasil</speaker>
     <p>Art can breathe only through life . I must live ! Art is for men and women . If I do not understand them , how can they understand my music ? I shall not play to sheep , nor rocks , nor stars , nor God , nor angels !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>You know what I mean , Vasil . In heart the true artist is all man , all woman ; but in genius , as impersonal as the universe .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Vasil</speaker>
     <p>I know it ! Have I not proved it to-day ? Petrov Kalushkin is lying over yonder bleeding from a hundred lashes , but I —<stage>taking up his violin</stage>— listen to “ The Joy of the Stars ! ”</p>

     <p>No , Vasil . But you must not care so much .</p>

     <p>Do n't you like me to care ?</p>

     <p>Yes , but ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Vasil</speaker>
     <p>Then I will . O , it is glorious to dream and know why ! To sing and know to whom the song belongs !</p>

     <p>My boy , make your country your goddess , not a woman .</p>

     <p>My dear Vasil ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Vasil</speaker>
     <p>Adrian is right . I must find that which is not country , nor home , nor people ,— the eternal in the hour .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Soph</speaker>
     <p>But Adrian cares for country , home , people .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Vasil</speaker>
     <p>No . He cares only for the soul . These other things are shadow boundaries in the mind that vanish when the soul looks on them . Here , I 'll show you how little he cares .<stage>Unfastens a chain from his neck and draws a medal from his bosom</stage>He gave me this , because I wanted it to play with . I was only a boy then . And he forgot all about it . Have you noticed how Adrian forgets ? I would not give it back because he was going to bury it .<stage>Holding out medal</stage>See ?<stage>Drawing it back</stage>You love him , do n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Soph</speaker>
     <p>Why — yes — you strange boy .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Vasil</speaker>

     <p>But I want you to look . The name is on it — his grandfather 's — great-grandfather 's — O , I do n't know how far back . But I am sure he was a great prince .</p>

     <speaker>Vasil</speaker>
     <p>Was n't he a great prince ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Soph</speaker>
     <p>Yes . But a greater man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Vasil</speaker>
     <p>And Adrian could be a prince too .<stage>Re-fastening chain</stage>But he does n't care at all . When I asked him if this was a piece of the sun , he said “ No , the last of a great shadow . ” I know what he meant now . Why are you sad , princess ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Soph</speaker>
     <p>Because I have been unkind to Adrian .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Vasil</speaker>
     <p>Do n't mind . He will forgive you . He forgives everybody everything .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Soph</speaker>
     <p>But it is n't pleasant to be forgiven that way , as if we were anybody else . I want to be forgiven because I am myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Vasil</speaker>
     <p>You can n't with Adrian . His star is the soul , and in its light we are all alike .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Soph</speaker>
     <p>And what is your star , Vasil ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Vasil</speaker>
     <p>Mine ? It is the same , only I call it love instead of soul . The great love — that makes one heart beat in another 's body — that makes me faint in Russia when a beggar starves in India — that fades your cheek with the girl 's at an English loom — that turns the comfortable American out of doors with the driven Jew — that gives one color to every flag , and makes the might of the strongest nation the right of the Kaffir babe . This is my star , as Adrian 's , only I see it warm and golden instead of cold and white .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Soph</speaker>
     <p><stage>Softly</stage>It may not be always cold and white to him .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Vasil</speaker>
     <p>I know . The great love .<stage>He plays , standing by window . Vera sits leaning against Sophie 's lap . The princess gazes toward the door , and her look meets Adrian 's as he enters .

     <speaker>Gregorief</speaker>
     <p><stage>Leaping up</stage>Move your Sunday-school to the dungeons of Schlusselburg ! Yes , I have been there . I was twenty years under the storm-waves of Lake Ladoga , and if your words could have reached me through the damp walls they would have received their true answer — a madman 's answer . For torture does not give men the serenity of gods or preachers , Lavrov . Twenty years of the silence that welcomes the silence of death — twenty years of the loneliness that makes men pray for the joy of weeping together — twenty years with starving eyes on naked walls , while above me the great , wide seasons were going by — twenty years of void and gloom with the windy waters whipping my prison island , and all the more maddening because I could not hear them , because they too were a silent guard . I was like this boy<stage>touching Vasil , who is leaning toward him listening intently</stage>when they put me in , and I came out — as you see .<stage>Laughs ironically</stage>But I am fortunate . I left others behind me to whom those dark doors will never open , while I have the privilege of — dying above ground .</p>

     <p>Ha ! I was n't a spirit then . They put me in while I was still in this life , where the flesh throbs and the blood sings . I was like this boy , I say , and I came out two months ago a broken consumptive wretch . You see me , Lavrov . Am I fit to leaven the race ? I am what oppression makes , not the meek angels you dream about . Into my children will go the bitterness of the wronged to come out in hate , the feebleness of the broken man to come out in cunning , the stinging for revenge to come out in murder ——</p>

     <p>Will you quietly permit Petrizoff 's ten-thousand murders ?</p>

     <p>There is a difference .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Greg</speaker>
     <p>Yes . We put one assassin to righteous death , he murders thousands of honest men .</p>

     <p>Your difference !</p>

     <speaker>Greg</speaker>
     <p>There is but one way to fight the devil !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>If you use his own fire you must live in hell to do it .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>And we do n't live in hell now , I suppose !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>Not an everlasting one . You have the selfishness of the living generation , Gregorief , that consumes as its candle the sun of the unborn .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Greg</speaker>
     <p>Bah ! Each generation must fight for its own breath .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>Who conquers with a club will rule with a club . It is only through the enduring righteousness now taking deepest root in the night of oppression that true liberation will come , pushing upward to flower in the conscience of every man . When we are free from within , government will of itself fall away ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Greg</speaker>
     <p>Anarchy !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>Yes . Anarchy of the soul , not of the blood . The anarchy that Christ saw when he said the meek shall inherit the earth . This is the vision before me , the vision that I held before the bleeding bodies in Lonz to-day ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Greg</speaker>
     <p>To the devil with your visions ! Man will always be a worm while he crawls ! It is those who have remembered their stature that have done most for the race . And I — from under their feet — with Death 's hand upon me — I will remember mine !</p>

     <p>Sir , we are true men .</p>

    <stage>Vasil suddenly appears in door , rear , waving a paper</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Vasil</speaker>
     <p>I have it : The song is ready !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking meaningly at Vasil</stage>Do n't be so sure of your first effort , my boy . Better let it get cold .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Orl</speaker>
     <p>No , we 'll hear it . That paper looks interesting .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Vasil</speaker>
     <p>Pardon me .<stage>Folds paper and puts it into his pocket</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Orl</speaker>
     <p>I insist upon hearing it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Vasil</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taking paper out reluctantly</stage>‘ Tis merely a song , sir , and will hardly bear reading . I will sing it for you .<stage>Unfolds paper slowly</stage>A Welcome to Summer , friends . ‘ Tis an old chorus , and you can help me with it .<stage>Sings</stage>Come out , come out with me To meet the summer maid ! A queen , a queen is she , Whose love is as the sea That would all lands caress , Whose loves are many as the sands , And each a sovereign is , For whom her arms enring Is royal by her kiss , Forevermore a king , a king , a king ! Come , dance , dance , dance , and welcome the summer maid ! Who has looked into her eyes is nevermore afraid ! We will gather our hearts together , we will mingle our feet on the grass , We will hold her with kisses , nor ever , nor ever let her pass !<stage>The peasants join in chorus</stage>Her free step is the dawn No darkness can waylay , Her laugh is the wild waterfall By winter never chained , Her hair the winds unreined , Her eyes unbridled sun , And all the waves are in her call That heard is never still , Her breath the clouds that hie Free as they list or will , And in her bosom find a greater sky ! Ye mothers , come , forsake Dead fire and frozen hearth ; The bones ye call your babes , awake , For in her lap she bears Sweet grain and golden ears That warming in their veins shall make The ruddy might of men ; Your daughters that now lie Blanched , broken , still , shall then Lift up rose faces and forget to die . Old Winter in his snows Is covered , covered deep , For all above him lie his slain , And not until his breath Has warmed them out of death May he arise from his cold sleep . Good-by , good-by , good-by , Old Winter dead and white , No more meet you and I , A last and long , a long and last good-night !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>As the chorus is sung the last time , Vasil dances out among the peasants , who join hands with him and all move in a ring , singing</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Orl</speaker>
     <p>I congratulate you . And now will you favor me with the copy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Vasil</speaker>
     <p><stage>Seeming to hesitate</stage>‘ Tis hardly worthy ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Orl</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taking it</stage>Leave that to me .<stage>Glances disappointedly at song , repeating the first line</stage>Humph ! Yes ...<stage>Puts it into his pocket</stage>So you are all true men enjoying yourselves ? I 've no objection . On the contrary . I 'm in the humor to join you if my lady Bright-eyes<stage>looking at Vera</stage>will honor me .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Vera rises , curtsies , and couples spring up , forming a dance , Orloff and Vera leading</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Orl</speaker>
     <p><stage>At close of the dance</stage>Thank you , Bright-eyes . I shall find no fairer partner at the ball , whither I must be going . And here , young man . I will leave you your song . It may be your only copy .<stage>Brings out several papers from his pocket and looks them over</stage>Here is the song , but ...<stage>Assumes sudden sternness</stage>A serious matter . I have lost an important paper since I came into this room .<stage>Looks searchingly at their faces</stage>An important paper on official business .<stage>All are silent , betraying no emotion . He turns his gaze to Vera , who is sitting by her grandfather</stage>Ah , my little lady , perhaps your fingers were busy in the dance . Come forward , please .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Vera steps out , bewildered</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Vera</speaker>
     <p>I did not touch it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Orl</speaker>
     <p>Of course not . Now will you shake your scarf , please ? Yes , I will do it for you .<stage>Shakes her scarf and a paper drops to the floor . Orloff picks it up</stage>Ah , found ! Good , but rather a sad affair for you , little one . Even fingers so dainty as yours must not meddle with the Czar 's papers .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Vera</speaker>
     <p>I did not touch them !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Orl</speaker>
     <p>Of course not . But you must come with me .<stage>Mutterings from the men</stage>I hear you , friends . If any of you want to come along just make it known . Our prisons are well stuffed , but we can manage to pack away all present .</p>
    </sp>

     <p><stage>After a second of silence</stage>The child is innocent .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Orl</speaker>
     <p>O , you want to go , do you ? But you happen to be the one we do n't want — yet . Anybody else ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Vera</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sobbing</stage>I did not touch it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Orl</speaker>
     <p>You may tell that to Petrizoff . He is always kind to beauty .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Vera</speaker>
     <p><stage>In terror</stage>Am I going to him ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>Orl</speaker>
     <p>He will not be far away , I imagine .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>You can not take this child . The paper was not stolen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Orl</speaker>
     <p>You saw it drop from her scarf .</p>

    <stage>Noise of a carriage at door . Sophie enters in ball dress . She draws back in astonishment at sight of Orloff</stage>
    <sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Orl</speaker>
     <p>At your service , your highness .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They draw aside , left , front . The peasants talk in low tones . Guards stand by Vera</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Soph</speaker>
     <p>Of course I know why you are here , but I had to simulate surprise .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Orl</speaker>
     <p>You were very successful .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Soph</speaker>
     <p>Since the exposure of this morning the people are ready to suspect me , and I must retain their confidence or my usefulness is at an end .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Orl</speaker>
     <p>Quite .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Soph</speaker>
     <p>They heard to-day of the girl 's danger , and were planning her escape , so I , not knowing whether you would arrive in time , stopped — to ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Orl</speaker>
     <p>Yes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Soph</speaker>
     <p>Quiet their fears and assure them of her safety . Are there any prisoners besides the girl ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Orl</speaker>
     <p>No , but I would give something to take this insolent Shepherd . I 've only a few hours to wait though .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Soph</speaker>
     <p>A few hours ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Orl</speaker>
     <p>Yes — ah , you do n't know everything then !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Soph</speaker>
     <p>Dear man , I know everything but one ,— that is , how much you know . If you will go to the ball in my carriage we may find out how far we can trust each other .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Orl</speaker>
     <p>Angel !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Soph</speaker>
     <p>Do n't ! The people — you must pretend to oppose me . They think I am interceding for the girl .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Orl</speaker>
     <p><stage>As if suddenly recalling something</stage>Why did you save the boy this morning ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Soph</speaker>
     <p>I will explain that too — in the carriage . We must go now . I first , so they will not know we leave together .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <lg>
      <stage>Crestfallen</stage>
      <l>I promised Petrizoff not to leave the girl till</l>
      <l>I had her safe in prison . There have been so many escapes ——</l>

     <p>Wait — I will go with you !</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>Soph</speaker>
     <p><stage>Melting</stage>Will you ? Then you sha'n ' t . You shall take no risks for me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Orl</speaker>
     <p>Risk ! I would risk anything . Ah , you can n't deprive me now .</p>

     <p>Can you trust the guards ?</p>

     <p>Very well . I will wait for you .<stage>Going , stops before Adrian</stage>I have not been able to obtain her release , but I am sure there is hope . At least I have touched Colonel Orloff 's heart . Have I not , Count ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Orl</speaker>
     <p>You have indeed !</p>
    </sp>

     <p><stage>After following Sophie 's departure with a fatuous look</stage>Come , lady-bird , we must be moving .<stage>Starts out , the guards following with Vera . Vetrova , who has seemed quite stunned , suddenly rushes after them and beats guards with his crutch</stage></p>

     <p><stage>Seizing him by the collar and throwing him to the floor</stage>You old fool ! We do n't want to bother with you !</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Vet</speaker>
     <p>Let me be , Adrian Lavrov ! I have held my peace all my life to die cursing at last ! I was dumb when they broke my bones under the rod . I was dumb when my son died under the lash . But Vera , my little girl — dragged to that — O God , send thy fires upon him ! Curse him — curse him — curse ——<stage>Dies . The peasants cross themselves . Some kneel before the icon , praying . Catherine gazes at Vetrova in hopeless terror . Galovkine kneels and examines the body</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Galovkine</speaker>
     <p>Dead .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Cath</speaker>
     <p>Dead — and a curse on his lips . My Petrusha — dead — and a curse on his lips .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Two men pick up the body and bear it off right centre , Adrian opening the door . Catherine follows with several women . The other peasants go off silently , street door , leaving only Adrian , Vasil and the revolutionists</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Greg</speaker>
     <p>As I was saying when — the Czar interrupted us — Petrizoff must die . And you will help us , Lavrov . Yes — you must ! You say yourself that our best hope lies in sympathy and sentiment ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>Which the bomb utterly destroys .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Greg</speaker>
     <p>Not when the Shepherd throws it . Wait ! I do not mean that literally , for this<stage>raising his hand</stage>is the consecrated hand . But your name as our leader would sanctify the deed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>Your leader ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Greg</speaker>
     <p>Yes . Not only for this , but for our army . Your name is a divine word in every peasant home in Russia . It is cheered by every body of workmen gathered together to-night , and in the army who would not surrender the colors of Romanov to the hero line of Donskoi ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p><stage>Starting</stage>Gregorief ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Greg</speaker>
     <p>Wait ! They are all ready now . The peasantry , inspired by the teaching of our martyrs for the last thirty years ,— the nobility with awakened conscience ,— the workmen , one great body with suspended arms ,— the army of the Czar ready to become the army of the people ,— all await their leader — you !<stage>A pause</stage>Russia is looking but one way — to freedom . To-day you may lead us to victory almost without blood . Let Petrizoff commit this crime in the name of liberty , and to-morrow we shall be like the scattered limbs of a dissevered body . You will not let this be , Lavrov . You will ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>No ! Let civilization wait another century rather than deliver her flag to the hands of murderers !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Greg</speaker>
     <p>And where is it now if not in the hands of murderers ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>It is not in their hands , Gregorief , but in ours , that are yet clean . Do this thing , and it is you , not Petrizoff , who give the greatest blow to freedom . The world is just beginning to understand us ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Greg</speaker>
     <p>Yes ! Where is that understanding growing strongest ? In America . And how does the autocracy propose to meet this new influence ? By a secret commercial treaty with the United States . Give any government a pocket interest in the security of another and to the winds with sympathy ! Petrizoff has his agents there now , and the burning of Yaltowa is only a part of his scheme to chill the hearts that are warming to us . But he shall not live to do it . You will not let him live , Lavrov . My God , do n't you see that your opportunity has come ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>Yes . My opportunity to point once more to where the sun shall rise .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Greg</speaker>
     <p>The sun never rises on the blind . You would throw us back into night for another thousand years !</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>What are a thousand years to the soul of man on the right path to the right thing ?</p>

     <p><stage>Plucking at Gregorief</stage>Come away . We lose time here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Greg</speaker>
     <p>Not until I tell this fool where he stands ! You imagine , Lavrov , that you are a friend to freedom , but a greater enemy does not tread Russian soil . Why does the government leave you at work ? Because of your power to subdue the spirit in men . It is you — such as you — who forget our shackles and fill the prisons . But thank the Powers that keep the race alive , there are still some of us who believe in manhood — in the virtues of the heart as well as the soul — in courage , honor , justice !<stage>To the others</stage>Come up to Breshloff 's .

     <p>If you would wait a little , Sasha . Reforms are coming . The Czar will grant a constitution ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Kore</speaker>
     <p>He will grant what we take , no more . And what do we gain if he gives us a constitution and keeps his army ? If he gives us schools and exiles the teachers ? If he gives us freedom and denies it to the men who have won it — our brothers in the dungeons ? No , we want our constitution , not the Czar 's — a constitution with law and justice behind it , not an army .</p>

     <p>Ignorance ! Where is it greater than among our masters ? We suffer as much from their stupidity as their oppression . I hate the ass 's head more than the tyrant 's !</p>

     <p>Viatka and Perm answer that ! There , where they have been let alone , they have established the best governed provinces in Russia .

    <sp>
     <speaker>Kore</speaker>
     <p>It is not too late ! Our friends — Russia — freedom — yet may live if you will help us ! Your name will justify Petrizoff 's death to the world .

     <p>Codes ! The question of a man 's right to his breath is settled outside of ethics ! O , Adrian , brother , be a man to-night and not a preacher ! Never in the history of the world has there been a revolution so ripe , so terrible , without a leader to march at its head .</p>

     <speaker>Kore</speaker>
     <p>Only for a day ! Petrizoff alone stands between us and the army . Vitelkin , the next in power , is ready to join us . But he is suspected already , and must soon resign — or be poisoned . If we remove Petrizoff now thirty regiments will come to us with Vitelkin , and others will follow until the Czar is without an army . In a month — a fortnight — the revolutionists will be masters of the nation ——</p>

     <p>Let me take my time . You would n't hurry on your way to Schlusselburg , would you ? I must speak to my friends first . Adrian — father , brother , master — the songs have all come back . When I only looked on , doing nothing to help , the music stopped , but now ——</p>

     <p>He is here — in this room — he is in every prison in Russia — he is in every heart that knows the meaning of love — but if you want to arrest him<stage>stepping back into the sunlight and pointing upward</stage>you must go up there , for he is God .</p>

     <p>O God , in all thy ages can this be justified ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Kore</speaker>
     <p>You can justify it in a moment . Adrian Lavrov , this is your call to war . If you respond , his life is well lost .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>War ?<stage>Staggers up</stage>Yes . And I will use the strongest of earthly weapons , the arms of peace . The powers that upbuild are as invincible as the universe . By them it stands . Only by their toleration do the forces of destruction live . Toleration ? Only by the support of the powers of peace do the powers that destroy exist . Is not the army of the Czar fed by us , clothed by us , paid by us ? And if we refuse to give , must it not beg of us ? If he who works not shall not eat , what is the doom of the destroyer ? The sower shall not sow for him , the reaper shall not reap for him , the builder shall not build for him , the physician shall not heal him , the scholar shall not teach him , the lawyer shall not plead for him , no trade shall supply him , no craft shall assist him , no art shall amuse him . The mills shall be silent , the wheels shall not turn , the wires shall be dumb , until he cries out “ Peace , thou art master : let me be so much as thy servant ! ”</p>

     <p>Right ! This , too , is war !</p>

     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>Yes . The new war of a new day . Not in madness hurling bombs , but giving our pity as we take our right .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Man</speaker>
     <p>And who will pay your soldiers of peace ? Must not their women and children eat ?</p>

     <p>You join us at last !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Adr</speaker>
     <p>No . We join each other ... under the only unconquerable power . Gather an army and go forth with guns , and you may be laid in the dust . But the gathered forces of peace are as the fingers on God 's hand , one with His strength , one with His will . Friends , friends , we have been searching earth for the weapon already in our grasp . The woman at the loom , the mujik in the field , the workman on the housetop , the man at the wire , the throttle , the wheel , hold it in their hands . To know its might — to use it together — that is all . Together ! O , they must see it — as I do now ! I will gather my disciples , we will knock at every door and preach the gospel of united peace until all our unions are one union , all our bodies one body , with one breath , one heart , one head . In barin and peasant , mechanic and noble , Christian and Jew , Finn , Pole , Czech , Serb , Georgian , Tatar , must be born as in one man the conscious strength of peace . And to its deliverance I give my life , my soul !<stage>Sits down . Sophie leans over him</stage>Yes ... he shall be free .</p>

     <p><stage>Who has been searching Vasil 's violin , comes forward with a paper in his hand</stage>They shall all be free ! We will make no terms , we will accept no constitution , till every dungeon door be open , till we hold in our arms the brothers who have made freedom no longer a dream of the night but a song of the morning ! To them we owe the liberty that is dawning , and shall we tread the earth they give us while they perish beneath it ? Hear our latest martyr — the youngest of us all . Hear the “ Voice of Schlusselburg ! ”<stage>Reads</stage>We are deep , we are deep Beneath your swift feet That pass and yet pass With unfaltering beat ; But life has no sound That can deaden our moans , And no measure of ground Can bury our bones , Can bury our bones . We have given ye all But our lingering breath ,— The light from our eyes , The prayer at our death . The wine of the days , Drink it up , drink it up ! But our hearts , as the grape , We pressed for the cup , We pressed for the cup . Through the measureless sun Your seasons shall sway . Pluck the fruit as your own , Ye have nothing to pay ; For your summers of bloom Are the summers we 've lost , And we in our tomb , We pay the red cost , We pay the red cost . Your youths shall be wed And the maids shall be fair , But the tears we have shed Are the pearls they shall wear ; Your bride ye shall seek As never we could , But the rose on her cheek , It is dyed with our blood , It is dyed with our blood . The lips of your child Shall be warm on your own , But ‘ tis cold , it is cold , Where our babes lie alone . The hand of your friend In yours ye shall take , But look ye !— the scar Ours wear for his sake , Ours wear for his sake . The feast shall be spread And the world shall be there , But set at the head Our invisible chair . Ay , the banquet is ours , For our dishes make room ! Each baked by the fires Of a smouldering home , Of a smouldering home . We are deep , we are deep Beneath your swift feet That pass and yet pass With unfaltering beat ; But life has no sound That can deaden our moans , And no measure of ground Can bury our bones , Can bury our bones .<stage>Curtain</stage>THE SIEGE A DRAMA IN FIVE ACTS CHARACTERS OF THE PLAY DIONYSIUS , the Younger , tyrant of Syracuse DION , a Syracusan noble ARISTOCLES , the Athenian friend of Dion OCRASTES , a young lord , attached to Dion HERACLIDES , admiral of Syracuse PHILLISTUS , an ambitious courtier CALLORUS , ÆGISTHUS , friends of Heraclides SPEUSIPPUS , from Athens , friend of Aristocles PANTHUS , captain of Dion 's Grecian guards DOMENES , captain of the tyrant 's guards TIMOLEON , ASCANDER , lords of Syracuse GYLIPPUS , MENODES , DRACON , citizens BRENTIO , slave to Dion TICHUS , slave to Aristocles ARATEA , wife of Dion NAURESTA , a noble lady THEANO , daughter of Nauresta METHONE , woman to Nauresta Soldiers , citizens , messengers , dancers , &amp; c .</p>

       <l>I followed Dion to the southern shore</l>
       <l>Where the new pinnace floats beneath the castle ,</l>
       <l>And there Domenes held him in close talk ,</l>
       <l>When suddenly ere wink could question it ,</l>
       <l>The soldiers had him bound within a boat</l>
       <l>Outrowing to the pinnace , which took him up</l>
       <l>And bent to sea like an embodied wind .</l>
       <l>But that a score of traitor arms enforced me</l>
       <l>The waves had kept me not on hated land !</l>

     <stage>SCENE : The grove of Ceres on the right , a temple partly visible . The island of Ortygia in rear , separated from mainland by a very narrow channel with wall on the Ortygian side running off stage left , to channel bridge where the ensuing conflict is supposed to centre . The island extends down to the Lesser Harbor , centre rear , which widens to a sea-glimpse at right . On the island shore in the farthest distance is outlined the temple of Artemis . Part of the Ortygian castle is shown on an island , left , the lower part concealed by channel wall .</stage>
     <stage>At extreme left , front , the entrance to Phillistus ’ dwelling is seen . Between dwelling and channel a road leads toward the bridge . At front of stage a road runs left toward the Greater Harbor , and right toward Epipolai , the outermost portion of the city .</stage>
     <stage>On the right , toward rear , terraces lead up to the heights of Achridina . Various statues are seen , the largest being a Victory at entrance to grove . Off the stage , left front , over Greater Harbor , the sun is setting , throwing gradually softening tints and increasing shadows .</stage>
     <stage>Troops of soldiers , laughing and talking with citizens in holiday costume , come up the road from the Greater Harbor and pass off toward Epipolai . Speusippus , Ascander , and Timoleon , enter from grove and stand near the Victory . At right front enter young men arrayed for banqueting , bearing wreaths , torches , etc . They turn to rear and pass up terraces toward Achridina , singing .</stage>
     <stage>O , pleasure is the wing of Time , Care his limping , leaden foot ! Too late , too late , for laugh and rhyme When old Winter 's at the root Of desire , And no fire Can thaw the frost where we lie mute .</stage>
     <stage>Then come all and feast ye now ! Come catch Love , the pretty rover ! Not a maiden bind her brow With a rose unkissed by lover ! As a flower Is Cupid 's hour , And where he flies none can discover .</stage>

      <l>Fair shining in the sun , and each with locks</l>
      <l>Bright garlanded ?— close treading them the guards —</l>
      <l>The hundred Grecian guards that watch by Dion ,</l>

      <l>I cry ho ! ho ! now had my house been burnt</l>
      <l>That were a woe ! But burns my house indeed ,</l>
      <l>I think of wife and child who perished not ;</l>
      <l>When dies my wife or son , I thank the gods</l>
      <l>That Death crept all so near and touched not me .</l>
      <l>And when his certain hour to clutch me comes</l>
      <l>I 'll think of famines , plagues , of earthquakes , floods ,</l>
      <l>And nations swept away . And still I 'll cure</l>
      <l>Such broad affliction with the thought of how</l>
      <l>The Universe itself is but a shell</l>
      <l>To crackle when it please the hand that made it .</l>
      <l>So , friends , I mend each woe with its own cloth</l>

      <l>With fear 's mad eloquence ,— saying that Dion</l>
      <l>Comes to avenge his wrongs and set up rule</l>
      <l>More cruel than Dionysius dared . And so</l>
      <l>This gay and garlanded humanity</l>

      <l>Gave them their choice , nor made warlike retort</l>
      <l>Beyond to warn them , with his finger lifted</l>
      <l>To yonder frowning castle , that the tyrant</l>

      <l>When you repeat the name I half believe</l>
      <l>I have a wife . Your voice was ever true ,</l>

      <l>A fairer than a Venus for the place .</l>
      <l>Speak on . Tell me her sum to the last doit .</l>

      <l>Nay , the appraising eye when fixed too near</l>
      <l>The thing it loves distorts the sweet proportion .</l>
      <l>You can adjust your gaze , take stand to bring</l>
      <l>Her beauty to perfection 's single-point .</l>

When Love drives , His chariot reins are veins of mortal men , Who fain must course the bright god 's destiny Nor reck the road . ‘ Tis strange — not that you loved her — But that I did not dream it must be so , She being the top and bloom of all her sex , As you , my lord , of yours . A mortal judge Would grant you her , but God gave her to me , And I doubt not He blundered to a purpose Beyond our dream . Ah me , the night 's red eyes Looked fatal on the sail that bore you hither . Cursed be my prayers that drew you from your Athens ! Farewell ! For you must go .

      <stage>Kisses her</stage>
      <l>O kiss that holds the mornings of all time ,</l>

      <l>Into my heart . Save me , Aristocles !</l>
      <l>O me , I 'm netted in these golden curls</l>
