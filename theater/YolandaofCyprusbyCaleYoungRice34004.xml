   <stage>SCENE : A dim Hall , of blended Gothic and Saracenic styles , in the Lusignan Castle , on the island of Cyprus near Famagouste . Around the walls , above faint frescoes portraying the deliverance of Jerusalem by the Crusaders , runs a frieze inlaid with the coats-of-arms of former Lusignan kings . On the left , and back , is a door hung with heavy damask , and in the wall opposite , another . Farther down on the right a few steps , whose railing supports a Greek vase with jasmine , lead through a chapel to the sleeping apartments . In the rear , on either side , are guled lattice windows , and in the centre an open grated door , looking upon a loggia , and , across the garden below , over the moonlit sea . Seats are placed about , and , forward , a divan with rich Turkish coverings . A table with a lighted cross-shaped candlestick is by the door , left ; and a lectern with a book on it , to the front , right . As the curtain rises , the Women , except CIVA , lean wearily on the divan , and HALIL near is singing dreamily :</stage>
   <stage>Ah , the balm , the balm , And ah , the blessing Of the deep fall of night And of confessing . Of the sick soul made white Of all distressing : Made white !... Ah , balm of night And , ah the blessing !</stage>
   <stage>[ The music falls and all seem yielding to sleep . Suddenly there are hoof-beats and sounds at the gates below . HALIL springs up .</stage>
   <stage>Halil . Alessa ! Maga ! Voices at the gates !</stage>
   <stage>[ All start up .</stage>
   <stage>Some one is come .</stage>
   <stage>Alessa . Boy , Halil , who ?</stage>
   <stage>Halil . Up , up ! Perhaps lord Renier — No : I will learn .</stage>
   <stage>[ He runs to curtains and looks .</stage>
   <stage>It is Olympio ! Olympio ! From Famagouste and lord Amaury !</stage>
   <stage>Mauria . Ah ! And comes he here ?</stage>
   <stage>Halil . As he were lord of skies ! To lady Yolanda , by my lute !</stage>
   <stage>Maga . Where is she ?</stage>
   <stage>Alessa . I do not know ; perhaps , her chamber .</stage>
   <stage>Mauria . Stay : His word may be of the Saracens .</stage>
   <stage>Halil ( calling ) . Oho !</stage>
   <stage>[ He admits OLYMPIO , who enters insolently down . All press round him gaily .</stage>
   <stage>Mauria . Well , what , Olympio , from Famagouste ? What tidings ? tell us .</stage>
   <stage>Maga . See , his sword !</stage>
   <stage>Olympio . Stand off .</stage>
   <stage>Mauria . The tidings , then , the tidings !</stage>
   <stage>Olympio . None — for women .</stage>
   <stage>Mauria . So-ho , my Cupid ? None of the Saracens ? Of the squadron huddling yesterday for haven At Keryneia ?</stage>
   <stage>Olympio . Who has told you ?</stage>
   <stage>Mauria . Who ? A hundred galleys westing up the wind , Scenting the shore , but timorous as hounds . A gale — and twenty down !</stage>
   <stage>Maga . The rest are flown ?</stage>
   <stage>Olympio . Ask Zeus , or ask , to-morrow , lord Amaury , Or , if he comes , to-night . To lady Yolanda I 'm sent and not to tattle , silly , here .</stage>
   <stage>[ He starts off , but is arrested by laughter within . It is CIVA who enters , holding up a parchment .</stage>
   <stage>O ! Only Civa .</stage>
   <stage>[ Starts again with HALIL .</stage>
   <stage>Civa . How , Olympio ! Stay you , and hear !— May never virgin love him ! Gone as a thistle ! ( turns ) .</stage>
   <stage>Mauria . Pouf ! ( laughs ) .</stage>
   <stage>Alessa ( to CIVA ) . Now what have you ?</stage>
   <stage>Civa . Verses ! found in the garden . Verses ! verses ! On papyrus of Paphos . O , to read ! But you , Alessa —!</stage>
   <stage>Alessa ( takes them ) . In the garden ?</stage>
   <stage>Civa . By The fountain cypress , at the marble feet Of chaste Diana !</stage>
   <stage>Maga . Where Sir Camarin And oft our lady —!</stage>
   <stage>Civa . Maga , will you prattle ? Read them to us , Alessa , read them , read . They are of love !</stage>
   <stage>Maga . No , sorrow .</stage>
   <stage>Civa . O , as a nun You ever sigh for sorrow !— They are of love ! Of princes bursting through enchanted bounds To ladies prisoned in an ogre 's keep ! Then of the bridals !— O , they are of love !</stage>
   <stage>Maga . No , Civa , no !— of sorrow ! see , her lips !</stage>
   <stage>[ She points to ALESSA , who , reading , has paled .</stage>
   <stage>See , see !</stage>
   <stage>Civa . Alessa !</stage>
   <stage>Alessa . Maga — Civa — Ah !</stage>
   <stage>[ She rends the parchment .</stage>
   <stage>Mauria . What are you doing ?</stage>
   <stage>Alessa . They were writ to her !</stage>
   <stage>Mauria . To her ? to whom ? what are you saying ? Read ! Read us the verses .</stage>
   <stage>Alessa . No .</stage>
   <stage>Mauria . Tell then his name Who writes them , and to whom .</stage>
   <stage>Alessa . I will not .</stage>
   <stage>Mauria . Then It is some guilt you hide !— And touching her You dote on — lady Yolanda !</stage>
   <stage>Alessa . Shame !</stage>
   <stage>Mauria . Some guilt Of one , then , in this castle !— See , her lips Betray it is .</stage>
   <stage>Maga . No , Mauria ! no ! no ! ( holds her ) hush !</stage>
   <stage>[ Forms appear without .</stage>
   <stage>Mauria . O , loose me .</stage>
   <stage>Maga . There , on the loggia ! Hush , see — Our lady and Sir Camarin .</stage>
   <stage>Alessa ( fearful ) . It is .... They heard us , Maga ?</stage>
   <stage>Maga . No , but ——</stage>
   <stage>Mauria ( to ALESSA ) . So ? that mouse ?</stage>
   <stage>Alessa . You know not , Mauria , what thing you say .— He is troubling her ; be still .</stage>
   <stage>[ Stepping out as BERENGERE enters .</stage>
   <stage>My lady ?</stage>
   <stage>Berengere ( unwillingly ) . Yes . It is time , now , for your lamps , And for your aves and o'erneeded sleep . But first I 'd know if yet lord Renier ——</stage>
   <stage>[ Sees ALESSA 'S face .</stage>
   <stage>Why are you pale ?</stage>
   <stage>Alessa . I ?</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . So — and strange .</stage>
   <stage>Alessa . We have But put away the distaff and the needle .</stage>
   <stage>CAMARIN enters .</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . The distaff and the needle — it may be . And yet you do not seem ——</stage>
   <stage>Alessa . My lady —?</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . Go . And send me Hassan .</stage>
   <stage>[ The women leave .</stage>
   <stage>Camarin — you saw ? They were not as their wont is .</stage>
   <stage>Camarin . To your eyes , My Berengere , that apprehension haunts . They were as ever . Then be done with fear !</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . I cannot .</stage>
   <stage>Camarin . To the abyss with it . To-night Is ours — Renier tarries at Famagouste — Is ours for love and for a long delight !</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . Whose end may be —</stage>
   <stage>Camarin . Dawn and the dewy lark ! And passing of all presage from you .</stage>
   <stage>Berengere ( sits ) . No : For think , Yolanda 's look when by the cypress We read the verses ! And my dream that I Should with a cross — inscrutable is sleep !— Bring her deep bitterness .</stage>
   <stage>Camarin . Dreams are a brood Born of the night and not of destiny . She guesses not our guilt , and Renier Clasps to his breast ambition as a bride — Ambition for Amaury .</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . None can say . He 's much with this Venetian , our guest , Though Venice gyves us more with tyranny Than would the Saracen .</stage>
   <stage>Camarin . But through this lady Of the Pisani , powerful in Venice , He hopes to lift again his dynasty Up from decay ; and to restore this island , This verdure-dream of the seas , unto his house . ‘ Tis clear , my Berengere !</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . Then , her design ? And , the requital that entices her ?</stage>
   <stage>[ Rises .</stage>
   <stage>Evil will come of it , to us some evil , Or to Yolanda and Amaury 's love .— But , there ; the women .</stage>
   <stage>Camarin . And too brief their stay . What signal for to-night ?</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . Be in the garden . Over the threshold yonder I will wave The candle-sign , when all are passed to sleep .</stage>
   <stage>Camarin . And with the beam I shall mount up to you Quicker than ecstasy .</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . I am as a leaf Before the wind and raging of your love . Go — go .</stage>
   <stage>Camarin . But to return unto your breast !</stage>
   <stage>[ He leaves her by the divan .</stage>
   <stage>[ The women re-enter with silver lighted lamps ; behind them are HASSAN and the slave SMARDA . They wait for BERENGERE , who has stood silent , to speak .</stage>
   <stage>Berengere ( looking up ) . Ah , you are come ; I had forgotten . And it is time for sleep .— Hassan , the gates : Close them .</stage>
   <stage>Hassan . And chain them , lady ?</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . Wait no longer . Lord Renier will not come .</stage>
   <stage>Hassan . No word of him ?</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . None , though he yesterday left Nicosie With the priest Moro .</stage>
   <stage>Hassan . Lady —</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . Wait no longer . Come , women , with your lamps and light the way .</stage>
   <stage>[ The women go by the steps . BERENGERE follows .</stage>
   <stage>Hassan ( staring after her ) . The reason of this mood in her ? the reason ? Something is vile . Lady Yolanda weeps In secret ; all for what ? By God ! the Paphian ? Or she of Venice ? ( sees SMARDA ) . Now slave ! Scythian ! Why do you linger ?</stage>
   <stage>Smarda . I am bidden — ( snarls ) by My mistress .</stage>
   <stage>Hassan . Spa ! Thy mistress hath , I think , Something of hell in her and has unpacked A portion in this castle . Is it so ?</stage>
   <stage>Smarda . My lady is of Venice .</stage>
   <stage>Hassan . Strike her , God . Her smirk admits it .</stage>
   <stage>Smarda . Touch me not !</stage>
   <stage>Hassan . I 'll wring Your tongue out sudden , if it now has lies . What of your lady and lord Renier ?</stage>
   <stage>Smarda . Off !</stage>
   <stage>RENIER enters behind , with MORO .</stage>
   <stage>Hassan . Your lady and lord Renier , I say ! What do they purpose ?</stage>
   <stage>Smarda . Fool-born ! look around .</stage>
   <stage>Hassan . Not till ——</stage>
   <stage>Smarda . Lord Renier , help .</stage>
   <stage>Hassan . What do you say ?</stage>
   <stage>[ Turns , and stares amazed .</stage>
   <stage>A fool I am ...</stage>
   <stage>Renier . Where is my wife ?</stage>
   <stage>Hassan . Why , she ... This slave stung me to pry .</stage>
   <stage>Renier . Where is my wife ?</stage>
   <stage>Hassan . A moment since she left — the women with her . She asked for your return .</stage>
   <stage>Renier . And wherefore did ?</stage>
   <stage>Hassan . You jeer me .</stage>
   <stage>Renier . Answer .</stage>
   <stage>Hassan . Have you not been gone ?</stage>
   <stage>Renier . Not — overfar . Where is Yolanda ?— Well ? No matter ; find my chamber till I come . Of my arrival , too , no word to any .</stage>
   <stage>[ HASSAN goes , confused .</stage>
   <stage>You , Moro , have deferred me ; now , I move . Whether it is suspicion eats in me , Mistrust and fret and doubt — of whom I say not , Or whether desire , and unsubduable , To see Amaury sceptred — I care not .</stage>
   <stage>[ To SMARDA .</stage>
   <stage>Slave , to your lady who awaits me , say I 'm here and now have chosen .</stage>
   <stage>Moro . Do not !</stage>
   <stage>Renier . Chosen .</stage>
   <stage>[ SMARDA goes .</stage>
   <stage>None can be great who will not hush his heart To hold a sceptre , and Amaury must . He is Lusignan and his lineage Will drown in him Yolanda 's loveliness .</stage>
   <stage>Moro . It will not .</stage>
   <stage>Renier . Then at least I shall uncover What this Venetian hints .</stage>
   <stage>Moro . Sir ?</stage>
   <stage>Renier . I must know .</stage>
   <stage>Moro . ‘ Tis of your wife ?— Yolanda ?</stage>
   <stage>Renier . Name them not . They 've shut me from their souls .</stage>
   <stage>Moro . My lord , not so ; But you repulse them .</stage>
   <stage>Renier . When they pity . No , Something has gone from me or never was Within my breast . I love not — am unlovable . Amaury is not so . And this Venetian Vittia Pisani ——</stage>
   <stage>Moro . Distrust her !</stage>
   <stage>Renier . She has power .</stage>
   <stage>Moro . But not truth . And yesterday a holy relic scorned .</stage>
   <stage>Renier . She loves Amaury . Wed to her he will Be the elected Governor of Cyprus . The throne , then , but a step .</stage>
   <stage>Moro . But all too great . And think ; Yolanda is to him as heaven : He will not yield her .</stage>
   <stage>Renier . Then he must . And she , The Venetian , has ways to it — a secret To wrench her from his arms .</stage>
   <stage>Moro . Sir , sir ?— of what ?</stage>
   <stage>Renier . I know not , of some shame .</stage>
   <stage>Moro . Shame !</stage>
   <stage>Renier . Why do you clutch me ?</stage>
   <stage>Moro . I — am a priest — and shame ——</stage>
   <stage>Renier . You show suspicions .</stage>
   <stage>[ VITTIA enters unnoted .</stage>
   <stage>Of whom ?— Of whom , and what ?</stage>
   <stage>Vittia ( lightly ) . My lord , of women .</stage>
   <stage>[ RENIER starts and turns .</stage>
   <stage>So does the Holy Church instil him .</stage>
   <stage>Renier . You Come softly , lady of Venice .</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . Streets of sea In Venice teach us .</stage>
   <stage>Renier . Of what women , then ? My wife ? Yolanda ?</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . By the freedom due us , What matters it ? In Venice our lords know That beauty has no master .</stage>
   <stage>Renier . Has no .... That , That too has something hid .</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . Suspicious lord ! Yet Berengere Lusignan is his wife ! And soon Yolanda — But for that I 'm here . You sent for me .</stage>
   <stage>Renier ( sullen ) . I sent .</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . To say you 've chosen ? And offer me irrevocable aid To win Amaury ?</stage>
   <stage>Renier . All is vain in me Before the fever for it .</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . Then , I shall . It must be done . My want is unafraid . Hourly I am expecting out of Venice Letters of power . And what to you I pledge is he shall be Ruler of Cyprus and these Mediterranean Blue seas that rock ever against its coast . That do I pledge ... but more .</stage>
   <stage>Renier . Of rule ?... Then what ?</stage>
   <stage>Vittia ( going up to him ) . Of shame withheld — dishonor unrevealed .</stage>
   <stage>[ As he recoils .</stage>
   <stage>Hush ! there are steps .</stage>
   <stage>[ The slave re-enters .</stage>
   <stage>Smarda ?</stage>
   <stage>Smarda ( quickly ) . My lady !</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . Speak .</stage>
   <stage>Smarda . I 've erred ; she 's not asleep .</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . Who ?— Ah ! Yolanda ?</stage>
   <stage>Smarda . Yes ; she is coming !</stage>
   <stage>Renier . Ha !</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . My lord ——!</stage>
   <stage>Renier . I 'll stay , Stay and confront her .</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . Ignorantly ? No .</stage>
   <stage>Renier . I 'll question her .</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . Blindly , and peril all ?</stage>
   <stage>Renier . I will return . You put me off , and off .</stage>
   <stage>[ By the loggia , with MORO , he goes ; the slave slips out . YOLANDA enters , sadly , her gaze on the floor . She walks slowly , but becoming conscious starts , sees VITTIA , and turns to withdraw .</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . Your pardon —</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . I can serve you ?</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . If you seek The women , they are gone .</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . I do not seek them .</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . Nor me ?</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Nor any .— Yet I would I might With seeking penetrate the labyrinth Of your intent .</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . I thank you . And you shall , To-night — if you have love .</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . That thread were vain .</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . I say , if you have love .</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Of guile ?</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . Of her You hold as mother , and who is Amaury 's .</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Were it so simple , all designs that ever Laired in you , would to my eyes have been as clear As shallows under Morpha 's crystal wave .</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . Unproven you speak so .</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . And proven would .</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . If so , then — save her .</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Who ? What do you —? ( stops ) .</stage>
   <stage>Vittia ( with irony ) . Mean ? It is not clear ?</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Save her ?</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . The surety flies Out of your cheek and dead upon your heart : Yet you are innocent — oh innocent !— O'er what abyss she hangs !</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . O'er no abyss .</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . But to her lord is constant !</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda ( desperate ) . She is constant .</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . And to his bed is true !</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . True .</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . And this baron Of Paphos — Camarin — is but her friend , And deeply yours — as oft you feign to shield her !</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . He is no more .</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . Your heart belies your lips , Knows better than believing what you say .</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Were , were he then ... ( struggles ) lord Renier knows it not ! And never must . I have misled his thought From her to me . The danger thus may pass , The open shame . Sir Camarin departed , her release From the remorse and fettering will seem Sweet as a vista into fairyland . For none e'er will betray her .</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . None ?</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Your tone ...! ( Realising . ) The still insinuation ! You would do it ! This is the beast then of the labyrinth ! And this your heart is !</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . No , not ever : no . But now , if you deny me .</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Speak as a woman , If there is womanhood in you to speak . The name of Berengere Lusignan must Go clean unto the years , fair and unsullied . Nor must the bloody leap Of death fall on her from lord Renier 's sword , A death too ready if he but suspect . No , she is holy ! And holy are my lips Remembering that they may call her mother ! All the bright world I breathe because of her , Laughter and roses , day-song of the sea , Not bitterness and loneliness and blight ! All the bright world , Of voices , dear as waking to the dead — Voices of love and tender earthly hopes — O , all the beauty I was once forbid ! For O !— She lifted me , a lonely convent weed , A cloister thing unvisited of dew , Withering and untended and afar From the remembered ruin of my home , And here has planted me in happiness . Then , for her , all I am !</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . Or — hope to be ?</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . The price , say , of your silence .— I am weary .</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . And would be rid of me .</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . The price , the price .</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . It is ( low and ashamed ) that you renounce Amaury 's love .</stage>
   <stage>[ A pause .</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Amaury 's love .... You then would rend me there Where not Eternity could heal the wound Though all the River of God might be for balm ! Cruelty like to this you could not do ?</stage>
   <stage>[ Waits a moment .</stage>
   <stage>A swallow on the battlements to-day Fell from the hawk : you soothed and set it free . This , then , you would not —!</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . Yes .</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . You cannot !</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . Yes .</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda ( wrung for a moment then calm ) . I had forgotten , you are of Venice — Venice Whose burdening is vast upon this land . Good-night .</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . And you despise me !</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . More I loathe That love of him has led your thought so low .</stage>
   <stage>[ Is going .</stage>
   <stage>Vittia . Stay ! If you leave and do not choose at once —</stage>
   <stage>[ Sounds are heard at the gates .</stage>
   <stage>Who 's that ?... ( starts ) . Amaury ?... You 've expected him ?</stage>
   <stage>[ The chains fall .</stage>
   <stage>Your purpose , then ! Is it now to renounce And force him from you or to have me breathe To Renier Lusignan the one word That will transmute his wrong to madness ? Say it ! For centuries have stained these walls But never a wife ; never —</stage>
   <stage>Enter BERENGERE .</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Mother ?...</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . Amaury Has spurred to us , Yolanda , from his post , And is below . But ... what has befallen ?</stage>
   <stage>[ Looks from one to the other .</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . He comes here , mother ?</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . At once .</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda ( in dread ) . Ah !</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . Child ?...</stage>
   <stage>Vittia ( to YOLANDA ) . To-night Must be the end .</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Go , go .</stage>
   <stage>Berengere ( as VITTIA passes out ) . What thing is this ?</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Mother , I cannot have him — here — Amaury ! Defer him but a little — till to-morrow . I cannot see him now .</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . This is o'erstrange .</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Help me to think . Go to him , go , and say Some woman thing — that I am ill — that I Am at confession — penance — that — Ah , say But anything !</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . Yolanda !</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Say .... No use . Too late .</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . His step ?</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Oh , unmistakable ; Along the corridor . Go !</stage>
   <stage>[ The curtains are thrown back .</stage>
   <stage>Amaury ( at the threshold ) . My Yolanda !</stage>
   <stage>[ Hastens down and takes her , passive , in his arms . BERENGERE goes .</stage>
   <stage>My , my Yolanda !...</stage>
   <stage>[ Kisses her .</stage>
   <stage>To touch you is as triumph to the blood , Is as the boon of battle to the strong !</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Amaury , no ; release me and say why You come : The Saracens —?</stage>
   <stage>Amaury . Not of them now !</stage>
   <stage>[ Bends back her head .</stage>
   <stage>But of some tribute incense to this beauty , Dear as the wind wafts from undying shrines Of mystery and myrrh ! I 'd have the eloquence of quickened moons Pouring upon the midnight magicly , To say all I have yearned , Now , with your head pillowed upon my breast ! Slow sullen speech , come to my soldier lips , Rough with command , and impotent of softness ! Come to my lips ! or fill so full my eyes That the unutterable shall seem as sweet To my Yolanda . But ... how , how now ? tears ?</stage>
   <stage>[ Lifts her face .</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Amaury ——</stage>
   <stage>Amaury . What have I done ? Too pronely pressed You to this coat of steel ?</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . No , no .</stage>
   <stage>Amaury . My words , Or silence , then ?</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Amaury , no , but sweet , Sweet as the roses of Damascus crusht , Your silence is ! and sweeter than the dream Of April nightingale on Troados , Or gushing by the springs of Chitria , Your every word of love ! Yet — yet — ah , fold me , Within your arms oblivion and hold me , Fast to your being press me , and there bless me With breathed power of your manhood 's might . Amaury !...</stage>
   <stage>Amaury . This I cannot understand .</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda ( freeing herself ) . Nothing — a folly — groundless frailty .</stage>
   <stage>Amaury . You 've been again at some old tale of sorrow ,</stage>
   <stage>[ Goes to the lectern .</stage>
   <stage>Pining along the pages of a book — This , telling of that Italy madonna Whose days were sad — I have forgotten how . Is it not so ?</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . No , no . The tears of women Come as the air and sighing of the night , We know not whence or why .</stage>
   <stage>Amaury . Often , perhaps . I am not skilled to tell . But never these ! They are of trouble known .</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Yet now forget them .</stage>
   <stage>Amaury . It will not leave my heart that somehow — how I cannot fathom — Camarin ——</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda ( lightly , to stop him ) . No farther !</stage>
   <stage>Amaury . That Camarin of Paphos is their cause .— Tell me ——</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Yes , that I love thee !</stage>
   <stage>Amaury . Tell me ——</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Love thee ! As sea the sky ! and as the sky the wind ! And as the wind the forest ! As the forest — What does the forest love , Amaury ? I Can think of nothing !</stage>
   <stage>Amaury . Tell me then you have Never a moment of you yielded to him , That never he has touched too long this hand — Till evermore he must , even as I — Nor once into your eyes too deep has gazed ! You falter ? darken ?</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Would he ne'er had come Into these halls ! that it were beautiful , Holy to hate him as the Lost can hate .</stage>
   <stage>Amaury . But ‘ tis not ?</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . God shall judge him .</stage>
   <stage>Amaury . And not you ?</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Though he is weak , there is within him —</stage>
   <stage>Amaury . That Which women trust ? and you ?</stage>
   <stage>[ BERENGERE enters . He turns to her .</stage>
   <stage>Mother ?</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . A runner , A soldier of your troop within the forts Has come with word .</stage>
   <stage>Amaury ( starting ) . Mother !</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . It is ill news ? I 've seen that battle-light in you before . ‘ Tis of the Saracens ? you ride to-night Into their peril ?</stage>
   <stage>Amaury . Come , the word , the word !</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . Only this token .</stage>
   <stage>Amaury . The spur ? the spur ? ( Takes it . ) They then Are landing !</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . How , Amaury ; tell your meaning !</stage>
   <stage>Amaury . The galleys of the Saracens have found Anchor and land to-night near Keryneia . My troops are ready and await me — So I must speed .</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda ( with strange terror ) . I pray you , do not go .</stage>
   <stage>Amaury . Yolanda !</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . If I am left alone —!</stage>
   <stage>Amaury . Yolanda !</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda ( sinking to a seat ) . I meant it not — a breath of fear — forget — And go .</stage>
   <stage>Amaury . I know you not to-night . Farewell .</stage>
   <stage>[ He kisses her and hurries off .... A silence .</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . Yolanda ——</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Mother , I will go to sleep .</stage>
   <stage>[ She rises .</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . A change has come to you — a difference Drawn as a veil between us .</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . I am weary .</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . You love me ?</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . As , O mother , I love him , With love impregnable to every ill , As Paradise is .</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . Then —</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . I pray , no more . To-night I am flooded with a deeper tide Than yet has flowed into my life — and through it Sounds premonition : so I must have calm .</stage>
   <stage>[ She embraces BERENGERE ; goes slowly up steps and off .</stage>
   <stage>Berengere ( chilled ) . What fear — if it is fear — has so unfixed her ? Is it suspicion ? Then I must not meet Him here to-night — or if to-night , no more . Her premonition !— and my dream that I Should with a cross bring her deep bitterness .</stage>
   <stage>[ Thinks a moment , then takes the crucifix from her neck .</stage>
   <stage>Had Renier but come , perhaps I might ...</stage>
   <stage>[ Lays it on table .</stage>
   <stage>O were I dead this sinning would awake me !... And yet I care not ( dully ) .... No , I will forget .</stage>
   <stage>[ Goes firmly from door to door and looks out each . Then lifts , unnoting , the cross-shaped candlestick ; and waving it at the loggia , turns holding it before her .</stage>
   <stage>Soon he will come up from the cool , and touch Away my weakness with mad tenderness . Soon he will ... Ah !</stage>
   <stage>[ Has seen with terror the candlestick 's structure .</stage>
   <stage>The cross !... My dream !... Yolanda !</stage>
   <stage>[ Lets it fall .</stage>
   <stage>Mercy of God , move in me !... Sacrilege !</stage>
   <stage>[ Sinks feebly to the divan , and bows , overcome .</stage>
   <stage>Camarin ( appearing after a pause on the loggia ) . My Berengere , a moment , and I come !</stage>
   <stage>[ Enters , locking the grating behind him . Then he hurries down and leans to lift her face .</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . No , no ! nor ever , ever again , for ever !</stage>
   <stage>[ Shrinks .</stage>
   <stage>Go from me and behind leave no farewell ....</stage>
   <stage>Camarin . This is — illusion . In the dew I 've waited , And the night 's song of you is in my brain — A song that seems ——</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . Withhold from words . At last Fate is begun ! See , with the cross it was I waved you hither . Leave me — let me pass Out of this sin — and to repentance — after .</stage>
   <stage>Camarin . I cannot , cannot !</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . Pity , then , my fear . This moment were it known would end with murder , Or did it not , dishonour still would kill ! Leave , leave .</stage>
   <stage>Camarin . To-morrow , then ; but not to-night !</stage>
   <stage>[ He goes behind and puts his arms around her .</stage>
   <stage>Give me thy being once again , thy beauty . For it I 'm mad as bacchanals for wine .</stage>
   <stage>[ YOLANDA , entering on the balcony , hears , and would retreat , but sees RENIER come to the grating .</stage>
   <stage>Once more be to me all that woman may ! Let us again take rapture wings and rise Up to our world of love , guilt would unsphere . Let us live over days that passed as streams Limpid by lotus-banks unto the sea , O'er all the whispered nights that we have clasped Knowing the heights and all the deeps of passion ! But speak , and we shall be amid the stars .</stage>
   <stage>[ RENIER draws a dagger and leaves the grating . With a low cry YOLANDA staggers down : the Two rise , fearful .</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . Yolanda !</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Mother , mother !... Ah , his eyes !</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . What brings you here — to spy upon me ?</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Listen !... Think not of me — no , hush — but of the peril Arisen up ... Your husband !</stage>
   <stage>Camarin . Renier ?</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Was at that grating — heard . And from its sheath Drew forth a dagger !— Ah !</stage>
   <stage>Berengere ( weakly ) . What does she say ?</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Find calmness now , and some expedient .</stage>
   <stage>[ She struggles to think .</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . I cannot die .</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . No , no .</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . My flesh is weak , Is poor of courage — poverished by guilt , As all my soul is ! But , Yolanda , you —!</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Yes , something must be done — something be done .</stage>
   <stage>[ CAMARIN goes to the curtains and returns .</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . The shame ... the shame ... the shame !</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . There yet is time .</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . You can deliver ! you are innocent .</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Perhaps . Let me but think .— He came ——</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . You see ? There is escape ? a way from it ?</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Perhaps . He came after your words ... yes ... could not see Here in the dimness ... but has only heard Sir Camarin ...</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . I do not know !</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Go , in ... Up to your chamber and be as asleep . There is a way — I think — dim , but a way . Go to your chamber ; for there yet may be Prevention !</stage>
   <stage>Berengere . I — yes , yes .</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . There is a way .</stage>
   <stage>[ BERENGERE goes .</stage>
   <stage>Strength now to walk it ! strength unfaltering .</stage>
   <stage>Camarin . What do you purpose ?</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Here to take her place , Here at the lowest of her destiny .</stage>
   <stage>Camarin . I do not understand .</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . But wholly shall . Clasp me within your arms ; he must believe ‘ Tis I and not his wife you have unhallowed , Your arms about me , though they burn ! and breathe me Thirst of unbounded love as unto her .</stage>
   <stage>[ He clasps her , and they wait .</stage>
   <stage>Ah , it is he !</stage>
   <stage>Camarin . No .</stage>
   <stage>Yolanda . Yes , the words ; at once !</stage>
   <stage>Camarin ( hoarsely ) . With all my body and soul-breath I love you ,</stage>
   <stage>[ RENIER enters with MORO .</stage>
   <stage>And all this night is ours for ecstasy . Kiss me with quenchless kisses , and embrace Me with your beauty , till ——</stage>
   <stage>[ YOLANDA with a cry , as of fear , looses herself , pretending to discover RENIER , who is struck rigid .</stage>
   <stage>Moro . My lord , my lord !... It is Yolanda .</stage>
   <stage>Renier . Then —</stage>
   <stage>[ The dagger falls from him .</stage>
   <stage>Why , then — Amaury !</stage>

     <head>SEVERAL DAYS HAVE ELAPSED</head>
     <stage>SCENE : The forecourt of the castle , beyond which is the garden and in the distance the mountains , under the deep tropical blue of morning . On the right the wall enclosing the castle grounds runs back and is lost in the foliage of cypress , palm , orange ; it is pierced by an arched gate with lifted portcullis . On the left rises the dark front of the castle , its arabesqued doorway open . Across the rear a low arcaded screen of masonry , with an entrance to the right , separates the court from the garden . Before it a fountain , guarded by a statue of a Knight of St. John , falls into a porphyry basin . By the castle door , to the front , and elsewhere , are stone seats . HASSAN is standing moodily by the screen , left , looking out the portcullis . He starts , hearing steps , and as the old leach TREMITUS enters , motions him silently into the castle ; then muttering “ the old blood-letter , ” stands as before , while CIVA , MAGA , and MAURIA are heard in the garden , and enter gaily bearing water-jars to the fountain . CIVA sees his look and breaks into a twitting laughter . The other two join her .</stage>

      <l>And overtake you though it were as far</l>
      <l>As the sea foams , or past the sandy void</l>

     <p>My lord ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renier</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Too much .</l>
      <l>You cherish her and reap unchastity</l>
      <l>For gratitude — unchastity against</l>
      <l>Our very son who was betrothed to her .</l>
      <l>Yet see her shameless .</l>
      <l>Berengere</l>
      <stage>dully</stage>
      <l>No ; I think you wrong her .</l>

    <stage>YOLANDA moves apart .</stage>

     <speaker>Renier</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Nobly you pity ! But it will not veil her .</l>
      <l>Rather the convent and the crucifix ,</l>
      <l>Matin and Vesper in a round remote ,</l>
      <l>And senseless beads , for such .— But what more now</l>
      <l>Is she demanding ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Berengere</speaker>
     <p>Little .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renier</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Not the means</l>
      <l>Still to deceive Amaury ?</l>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Berengere</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Renier ... no .</l>
<stage>Speaks loathly .</stage>      <l>But I have a request that , if you grant ,</l>
      <l>Will lead peace back to us ... and from us draw</l>
      <l>This fang of fate .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renier</speaker>
     <p>Ah .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Berengere</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Yes .</l>
      <l>Renier</l>
      <stage>slowly</stage>
      <l>And we might be</l>
      <l>As those that wedded love ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Berengere</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renier</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>That — love !</l>
<stage>A pause .</stage>      <l>Then it shall be , at once .... But no , I first</l>
      <l>Have a confession .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Berengere</speaker>
     <p>You ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renier</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>A pang !— For days</l>
<stage>Takes her hand .</stage>      <l>Before I found Yolanda on the breast</l>
      <l>Of Camarin of Paphos ——</l>
      <l>I suffered in the furnace of suspicion</l>
      <l>The fume and suffocation of the thought</l>
      <l>That you were the guilty one — you my own wife .</l>
<stage>She recoils to YOLANDA , who comes up .</stage>      <l>I did ; but rue , rue it !...</l>
      <l>... Yet — it is just</l>
      <l>That you recoil even as now you do</l>
      <l>From stain upon your wedded constancy ....</l>
      <l>And time that is e'erhYpppHeNpitiful must pass</l>
      <l>Over it —</l>
      <l>Before there is forgiveness . And perhaps</l>
      <l>Then I shall win you as I never have .—</l>
      <l>Now the request .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Berengere</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>That now ... I cannot plead .</l>
<stage>Sees YOLANDA harden . Is impelled .</stage>      <l>And yet I must .... It is that , till I bid ,</l>
      <l>Amaury may not know of this ... not know</l>
      <l>This trouble fallen from a night of evil ——</l>
      <l>Pitiless on us as a meteor 's ash .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renier</speaker>
     <p>Not of it ? he ? not know ?</p>

     <p>Trust to me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renier</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>How !</l>
      <l>And to this wanton 's perfidy to bind</l>
      <l>Him witless to her — with a charm perhaps —</l>
      <l>Or , past releasing , with a philtre ? She</l>
      <l>Whom now he holds pure as a spirit sped</l>
      <l>From immortality , or the fair fields</l>
      <l>Of the sun , to be his bride ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Yolanda</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Sir , no !... She means</l>
      <l>Not I shall wed him !</l>
      <stage>Winningly .</stage>
      <l>Only that you spare</l>
      <l>To separate us with this horror ; that</l>
      <l>You trust me to dispel his love , to pall</l>
      <l>And chill his passion from me . For I crave</l>
      <l>Only one thing — innocence in his sight .</l>
      <l>Believe !— believe !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renier</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I will — that you are mad .</l>
      <l>Yet madder I , if to this murk my brain</l>
      <l>Were blind .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Yolanda</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>As it will be ! in deadlier dark ,</l>
      <l>If you attend me not !</l>
      <l>And may have destiny you cannot know .</l>
      <l>But you will heed ?</l>
      <l>For somewhere in you there is tenderness .</l>
      <l>Once when you chafed in fever and I bore</l>
      <l>White orange blossoms dewy to your pillow</l>
      <l>You touched my hand gently , as might a father .</l>
<stage>Caresses his .</stage>      <l>Once on the tower when alone at dusk</l>
      <l>I sang — I know not why — of lost delights ,</l>
      <l>Of vanished roses that are e'er recalling</l>
      <l>May to the world , you came and suddenly</l>
      <l>Lifted my brow up silent to your kiss .</l>
      <l>Ah , you remember ; you will hear me ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renier</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>No !</l>
      <l>Though you are cunning .— Thus you wove the mesh</l>
      <l>About Amaury — till he could not move</l>
      <l>Beyond you .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Yolanda</speaker>
     <p>For his sake I ask it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renier</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>For</l>
      <l>No sake but to o'ersway him with your eyes</l>
      <l>In secret , thus , and with</l>
      <l>Your hair that he believes an aureole</l>
      <l>Brought with you out of Heaven .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Berengere</speaker>
     <p>Again — wrong .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renier</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>So deem you and , my Berengere , I grieve ,</l>
      <l>Desiring much your peace .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Berengere</speaker>
     <p>It grieves you not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renier</speaker>
     <p>Then not ! and half I fear — you hear ?— it should not . There 's midnight in this thing and mystery . Does she not love — Camarin ? Yolanda<stage>trembling</stage>Say no more . Be all — all as you will .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renier</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>That brings you low :</l>
      <l>But brings to me no light — only again</l>
      <l>The stumbling in suspicion .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Yolanda</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>It should not .</l>
      <l>Renier</l>
      <stage>with a sudden gleam</stage>
      <l>To-morrow then , unless Amaury runs</l>
      <l>Fitting revenge through Camarin of Paphos ,</l>
      <l>Your lover , you shall clasp him openly</l>
      <l>Before all of Lusignan .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Yolanda</speaker>
     <p>No ; no , no ! The thought of it is soil !... Rather ... his death !</p>

      <l>My lord , she knows not what she says .</l>

The interior of the Hall is the same ; only the divan is placed to the front and left , the lectern near the balcony leading to the sleeping apartments and to the chapel . SMARDA is lying lithely on the divan , beguiled with her charms and amulets , and from time to time giving a low , sinuous laugh .

     <stage>SCENE : The Chapel of the Castle — or Chapel of the Magdalen — a few hours later . It is of stone , low-arched , gloomy , and adorned with Byzantine mosaics of gaunt saints on backgrounds of gold . The altar is in the rear , and above it a large window , through which pours the still moon . In front of it , to either side , rise two pillars supporting the roof , and on one of them , halfway up , stands a stone image of the Magdalen . Forward are two other pillars whose bases form seats . The right wall has , set midway , a large door hung with heavy curtains . In the rear are smaller doors leading to a sacristy . The altar lamp and a few tapers burn . ALESSA enters , rubbing her eyes as if to clear them of vision , looks around , then calls uncertainly —</stage>

     <speaker>Yolanda</speaker>
     <p>For you !— and her who sleeps forgiven there ,<stage>Raptly .</stage>Now while her spirit weightless overwingeth Night , to that Throne whose seeing heals all shame ! For her I did ! but oh , for you , whose least Murmur to me is infinite with Spring , Whose smile is light , filling the air with dawn , Whose touch , wafture of immortality Unto my weariness ; and whose eyes , now , Are as the beams God lifted first , they tell us , Over the uncreated , In the far singing mother-dawn of the world !— Come with me then , but tearless , to her side .<stage>They go to the bier and stand as in a dream . A pause , then her lips move , last , as if inspired .</stage>While there is sin to sway the soul and sink it , Pity should be as strong as love or death !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>With a cry of joy he enfolds her , and they kneel , wrapped about with the clear moon .</stage>
