    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>A charming room in the Tillmans ’ house . The walls are white woodwork , framing in old tapestries of deep foliage design , with here and there a flaming flamingo ; white furniture with old , green brocade cushions . The room is in the purest Louis XVI . The noon sunlight streams through a window on the left . On the opposite side is a door to the hall . At back double doors open into a corridor which leads to the ballroom . At left centre are double doors to the front hall . A great , luxurious sofa is at the left , with chairs sociably near it , and on the other side of the room a table has chairs grouped about it . On floral small table are books and objets d'art , and everywhere there is a profusion of white roses and maidenhair fern .</stage>
     <stage>In the stage directions Left and Right mean Left and Right of actor , as he faces audience .</stage>
     <stage>Three smart-looking SERVANTS are peering through the crack of the folding door , their backs to the audience . The pretty , slender MAID is on a chair . The elderly BUTLER dignifiedly stands on the floor . The plump , overfed little HOUSEMAID is kneeling so as to see beneath the head of the BUTLER .</stage>
    </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HOUSEMAID</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gasping .</stage>Oh , ai n't it a beautiful sight !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>BUTLER</speaker>

      <stage>Pompously .</stage>
      <l>Not to me who ‘ ave seen a Lord married in</l>
      <l>Hengland .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , you make me sick , Mr. Potts , always talking of your English Aristocracy ! I 'm sure there never was no prettier wedding than this . Nor as pretty a bride as Miss Jinny .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BUTLER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Correcting her .</stage>Mrs. Haustin !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HOUSEMAID</speaker>
     <p>She looks for all the world like one of them frosted angels on a Christmas card . My , I wish I could ‘ a ’ seen her go up the aisle with the organ going for all it was worth !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p>It was a beautiful sight !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BUTLER</speaker>
     <p>A good many ‘ appens to be ‘ aving the sense to be going now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HOUSEMAID</speaker>
     <p>Could you hear Miss Jinny say “ I do , ” and make them other remarks ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , plain , though her voice was trembly like . But Mr. Austin he almost shouted !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Laughing nervously in excitement .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BUTLER</speaker>
     <p>‘ E 's glad to get ‘ er !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p>And her him !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HOUSEMAID</speaker>
     <p>Yes , that 's what I likes about it . Did any one cry ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p>Mrs. Tillman . Lots of people are going now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HOUSEMAID</speaker>
     <p>What elegant clothes ! Oh , gosh !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BUTLER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Superciliously .</stage>Mrs. Cullingham do n't seem in no ‘ urry ; she 's a common lot !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p>I do n't care , she 's rich and Miss Jinny likes her ; she just throws money around to any poor person or church or hospital that wants it , or do n't ! So she can n't be so very common neither , Mr. Potts !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HOUSEMAID</speaker>
     <p>Say , I catch on to something ! Young Mr. Tillman 's sweet on that there tall bridesmaid .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sharply .</stage>Who ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BUTLER</speaker>
     <p>Miss Chester . I 've seen there was something goin ’ hon between them whenever she 's dined or lunched ‘ ere .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Angry .</stage>‘ Tai n't true !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BUTLER</speaker>
     <p>I 'll bet my month 's wages .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p>I do n't believe you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BUTLER</speaker>
     <p>Why , what 's it to you , please ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Saving herself .</stage>Nothing —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HOUSEMAID</speaker>
     <p>Well , I guess it 's truth enough . That 's the second time I 've seen him squeeze her hand when no one was n't lookin ’ .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Here , change places with me !</l>
      <stage>Getting down from her chair .</stage>
      <l>If you was a gentleman , Mr. Potts , you 'd have given me your place !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <stage>Witheringly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BUTLER</speaker>
     <p>If I was a gentleman , miss , I would n't be here ; I 'd be on the other side of the door .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He moves the chairs away .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>To Housemaid .</stage>Honest , you saw something between them ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HOUSEMAID</speaker>
     <p>Who ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p>Him and her ? Mr. Geoffrey and Miss Chester —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>HOUSEMAID</speaker>
     <p>Cheese it ! they 're coming this way !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She and the MAID and the BUTLER vanish through the door Right .</stage>
    <stage>GEOFFREY and RUTH enter through the double doors quickly at back . GEOFFREY is a young , good-looking man , but with a weak face . He is of course very smartly dressed . RUTH is a very serenely beautiful girl , rather noble in type , but unconscious and unpretending in manner . They close the doors quickly behind them .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>We 'll not be interrupted here , and I must have a few words with you before you go .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He follows her to the sofa where she sits , and leans over it , with his arm about her shoulder .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Geof ,— Geof , why were n't we married like this ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>It could n't be helped , darling !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>It is n't the big wedding I miss , oh , no , it 's only it seemed sweeter in a church . Why did we have to steal off to Brooklyn , to that poor , strange little preacher in his stuffy back parlour , and behave as if we were doing something of which we were ashamed ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>You love me , I love you ,— is n't that the chief thing , dearest ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>But how much longer must we keep it secret ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>Till I can straighten my affairs out . I can n't explain it all to you ; there are terrible debts ,— one more than all the others ,— a debt I made when I was in college .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>If I could only help you ! I have a little money .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>No , I love you too much ; besides , this debt is n't money , and I hope to get rid of it somehow before long .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Forgive me for worrying you . It is only that every one is so happy at this wedding except me ,— dear Jinny brimming over with joy , as I would be ,— and it 's made me feel — a little —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Comes around the sofa and sits beside her .</stage>I know , dear , and it 's made me feel what a brute I am ! Oh , if you knew how I hate myself for all I 've done , and for the pain and trouble I cause you now !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MAGGIE , her sharp features set tense , appears in the doorway on the left behind the curtains and listens .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Never mind , we wo n't think of that any more .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>I can never throw it off , not for a minute ! I 'm a worthless fellow and how can you love me —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Interrupting him .</stage>I do ! You are worth everything to me , and you will be worth much to the world yet !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>I love you , Ruth — that 's the one claim I can make to deserve you . But it 's helped me to give up all the beastly pleasures I used to indulge in !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Softly .</stage>Geof !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>Which I used to think the only things worth living for , and which now , thanks to you , I loathe ,— every one of them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>I 'm so glad ! I 've been some help , then .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>If I 'd only got you earlier , I 'd have been a different man ,</l>
      <l>Ruth !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling and taking his nervous hand in hers .</stage>Then I might n't have fallen in love with you if you were a different man !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>Dear girl ! Anyway , this is the good news that I want to tell you — I hope now to have things settled in a couple of weeks .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p><stage>In glad relief .</stage>Geoffrey !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>But — I may n't be successful ; it might be , Ruth — it might be , we would have to wait — for years —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quietly .</stage>I do n't think I could bear that ! It 's not easy for me to lie and deceive as I 've had to the last few months ; I do n't think I could keep it up .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PETER CULLINGHAM enters suddenly , from the ballroom , a pale young man , but , unlike GEOFFREY , hard and virile .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Oh , here you are ! I say , are you two spoony ? Just the way I feel !<stage>Laughing .</stage>I caught and hugged old Mrs. Parmby just now ! I think it 's sort of in the air at weddings , do n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rising .</stage>I 'm surprised to see you 've left the refreshment table , Peter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>They sent me to find Miss Chester — they 're going to cut the bridesmaid 's cake , and if you two really are spoony , Miss Chester , you 'd better not miss it — you might get the ring !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They laugh as PETER takes out a bottle from which he takes a round , black tablet which he puts in his mouth .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Also rising .</stage>I 'd better go .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PETER is making frantic efforts to swallow the tablet .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Noticing him .</stage>What 's the matter with you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>O dear ! I 've eaten so many ices and fancy cakes , I 've got awful indigestion , and I 'm trying to swallow a charcoal tablet .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Come with me and get a glass of water .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>No , it 's very bad to drink water with your meals ; but I 'll get a piece of bridesmaid 's cake — that 'll push it down !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PETER and RUTH go out through the double doors .</stage>
    <stage>The moment they are out of the room , MAGGIE comes from behind the curtain and goes straight up to GEOFFREY . He looks astonished and frightened .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>What do you want ? Have you been listening ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p>So that 's it , is it ? You want to marry her when you can get rid of me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p><stage>With relief .</stage>What do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I may not have heard everything , but I heard and saw enough to catch on that you 're in love with Miss Chester .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>Well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p>Well , you wo n't marry her — I 'll never set you free .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>Sh !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Looking about and closing the doors .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , they 're all in the dining room .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Angry .</stage>What do you want , anyway ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>She pleads a little .</stage>When I came here to your house and got a position , it was because I loved you , if you had treated me bad , and I hoped by seeing you again , and being near you , you might come back to me and everything be made straight !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>Never ! Never ! It 's impossible .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Angry again .</stage>Oh , is it ! Well , the dirty little money you give me now only holds my tongue quiet so long 's you behave yourself and do n't run after any other girls ! But the minute you try to throw me down , I 'll come out with the whole story .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>I was drunk when I married you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p>More shame to you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>You 're right . But I was only twenty — and you — led me on —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Interrupting him .</stage>Me ! led you on ! me , as decent and nice a girl as there was in New Haven if I do do housework , and that 's my wedding ring and you put it there , and mother 's got the certificate locked up good and safe in her box with my dead baby sister 's hair and the silver plate off my father 's coffin !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>We must n't talk here any more !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p>You look out ! If I was n't so fond of your sister Miss Jinny , and if the old people were n't so good to me , I 'd just show you right up here — now !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>I 'll buy you off if I can n't divorce you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p>You ! Poof !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>GIRLS ’ voices are heard from the ballroom .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>Look out — some one 's coming !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Going .</stage>You have n't got a red cent ; my cheque 's always one of your father 's !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She goes out Right .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>Good God ! what am I going to do — shoot myself , if I do n't get out of this soon — I must get some air !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out Left .</stage>
    <stage>JINNY opens the double doors , looks in , and then enters . She is an adorable little human being , pretty , high-strung , temperamental , full of certain feminine fascination that defies analysis , which is partly due to the few faults she possesses . She is , of course , dressed in the conventional wedding-dress , a tulle veil thrown over her face .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Not a soul ! Come on !<stage>She is followed in by the four BRIDESMAIDS — nice girls every one of them — and also , very slyly , by SUSIE , a very modern spoiled child , who sits unobserved out of the way at the back .</stage>Now , my dears , I wish to say good-by all by ourselves so I can make you a little speech !<stage>All laugh gently .</stage>In the first place I want to tell you that there 's nothing like marriage ! And you must every one of you try it ! Really , I was never so happy in my life !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRACE</speaker>
     <p>Must we stand , or may we sit down ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , stand ; it wo n't be long and you 'll only crush your lovely frocks . In fact , I advise you not to lose any time sitting down again until you 've got the happy day fixed !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>You know , Jinny darling , that there is no one so glad for your happiness as your four bridesmaids are — is n't that so , girls ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALL</speaker>
     <p>Yes !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>And they all together embrace JINNY , saying , “ Dear old Jinny , ” “ Darling Jinny , ” “ We 'll miss you dreadfully , ” etc ., ad lib ., till they get tearful .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Good gracious , girls , we must n't cry . I 'll get red eyes , and Jack 'll think what an awful difference just the marriage service makes in a woman .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The doors at the back open , and AUSTIN appears in the doorway .</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN is a typical New Yorker in appearance , thirty-two years old , good-looking , manly , self-poised , and somewhat phlegmatic in temperament .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Hello ! May a mere man come in to this delectable tea party ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>No , Jack ! But wait — by the door till I call you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Amused .</stage>Thank you !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out , closing the door .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTRUDE</speaker>
     <p>We 'll miss you so awfully , Jinny .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Just what I say ! Get a man to keep you company , and then you wo n't miss any one .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BELLE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Yes , but attractive men with lots of money do n't come into the</l>
      <l>Grand Central Station by every train !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Putting her arm about her .</stage>You want too much , my dear Belle ! And you are n't watching the Grand Central Station either half so much as you are the steamer docks for a suitable person . Now do n't be angry ; you know you want a good big title , and you 've got the money to pay , but , my dear Belle , it 's those ideas of yours that have kept you single till — twenty-six !— now that you must confess was nice of me , to take off three years !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BELLE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laughing .</stage>Jinny , you 're horrid !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>No , I 'm not ! You know I 'm really fond of you , or you would n't be my bridesmaid to-day ; it 's only that I want your wedding to be as happy as mine — that 's all , and here 's a little gift for you to remember your disagreeable but loving friend by !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Giving her a small jewelry box .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BELLE</speaker>
     <p>Thank you , Jinny ! Thank you !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>A little moved .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRACE</speaker>
     <p>Mercy ! I hope you 're not going to take each one of us !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>I am , and come here , you 're next !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRACE</speaker>
     <p>I 'll swear I do n't want to get married at all !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Do n't be silly , you icicle ! Of course you do n't ; you freeze all the men away , so that you 've no idea how nice and comfy they can be ! My advice to you , Grace darling ,— and I love you , or I would n't bother ,— is to thaw !<stage>Laughs .</stage>I used to be awfully jealous of you —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRACE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Interrupting .</stage>Oh !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I was ! You 're lots prettier than I am .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRACE</speaker>
     <p>Jinny !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>You are ! But I got over it because I soon saw you were so cold , there was no danger of any conflagration near you ! Oh , I 've watched your eyes often to see if any man had lighted the fires in them yet . And now I 'm determined they shall be lighted . You 're too cold ! Thaw , dear ,— not to everybody ,— that would be like slushy weather , but do n't keep yourself so continually so far below zero that you wo n't have time to strike — well — say eighty-five in the shade , when the right bit of masculine sunshine does come along ! Here — with my best love !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Giving her a small jewelry box .</stage>
    <stage>GRACE kisses JINNY .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTRUDE</speaker>
     <p>I am the next victim , I believe !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>All I 've got to say to you , Miss , is , that if you do n't decide pretty soon on one of the half dozen men you are flirting with disgracefully at present , they 'll every one find you out and you 'll have to go in for widowers .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTRUDE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Mockingly .</stage>Horrors !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I do n't know ! I suppose a widower is sort of broken in and would be more likely to put up with your caprices ! For the sake of your charm and wit and true heart underneath it all , you dear old girl you !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Giving her a small jewel box .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTRUDE</speaker>
     <p>Thank you , Jinny . I 'm only afraid I will do the wrong thing with you away ! You know you 're always my ballast !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Nonsense ! Female ballast is no good ; masculine ballast is the only kind that 's safe if you want to make life 's journey in a love balloon .<stage>SHE turns to RUTH CHESTER .</stage>Ruth — the trouble with you is , you 're too sad lately , and show such a lack of interest . I should think you might be in love , only I have n't been able to find the man . Anyway , if you are n't in love , you must pretend an interest in things . Of course , men 's affairs are awfully dull , but they do n't like you to talk about them , so it 's really very easy . All you have to do is listen , stare them straight in the eyes , think of whatever you like , and look pleased ! It does flatter them , and they think they are interesting , and you charming ! Wear this , and think of me !<stage>Giving her a box .</stage>and be happy ! I want you to be happy — and I can see you are n't !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Kissing her .</stage>Thank you , dear !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>There , that 's all !— except — when I come home from abroad in October , if every one of you are n't engaged to be married , I 'll wash my hands of you —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They all laugh .</stage>
    <stage>SUSIE , sliding off her chair at back , comes forward .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SUSIE</speaker>
     <p>Now , it 's my turn ! You can n't chuck me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Trying not to laugh .</stage>Susie ! where did you come from and what do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SUSIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , you give me a pain !— I went up the aisle with you to-day , too — what 's the matter with telling me how to get married !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>I 'll tell you this , your language is dreadful ; where do you get all the boy 's slang ? You do n't talk like a lady .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SUSIE</speaker>
     <p>I 'm not a lady . I 'm a little girl !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>You talk much more like a common boy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SUSIE</speaker>
     <p>Well , I 'd rather be a boy !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Susie , I shall tell Aunt Laura her daughter needs looking after .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SUSIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , very well , cousin Jinny . If you 're going to make trouble , why , forget it !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Turns and goes out haughtily , Right .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Going to the double doors , calls .</stage>Now you can come in , Jack .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>AUSTIN enters .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>And now I 've only time to say good-by . All your guests have gone except the Cullinghams , who are upstairs with your mother , looking at the presents .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTRUDE</speaker>
     <p>Come ! All hands around him !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The five GIRLS join hands , with AUSTIN in the centre .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BELLE</speaker>
     <p>We do n't care if every one else has gone or not , we 're here yet !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>So I see ! But I am ordered by my father-in-law — ahem !<stage>all laugh</stage>— to go to my room , or he thinks there will be danger of our losing our train .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALL THE BRIDESMAIDS</speaker>
     <p><stage>Ad lib .</stage>Where are you going ? Where are you going ? We wo n't let you out till you tell us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>I dare n't — I 'm afraid of my wife !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Bravo , Jack !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRACE</speaker>
     <p>Very well , then , we 'll let you out , on one condition , that you kiss us all in turn .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The GIRLS laugh .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>No ! No !<stage>Breaking away .</stage>He sha n't do any such thing !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They all laugh and break up the ring .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTRUDE</speaker>
     <p>Dear me , is n't she jealous !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BELLE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , it is evidently time we all went ! Good-by , Jinny !<stage>Kissing her .</stage>A happy journey to Washington !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>No , it is n't !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>General good-bys . JINNY begins with RUTH at one end , and AUSTIN at the other ; he says good-by and shakes hands with each girl .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERTRUDE</speaker>
     <lg>

    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Not a bit !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRACE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Kissing JINNY .</stage>Good-by , I believe it 's Boston or Chicago !</p>

     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Thank you .</p>

    <stage>She turns and goes with the other three girls to the double doors at back , where they are heard talking .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Austin ?</p>

     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Embarrassed .</stage>You like your new brother , do n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Geof ? most certainly I do , and Jinny adores him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>I know , then , you 'll be a good friend to him if he needs one .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Surely I will .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>I think he does need one .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Really —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The GIRLS are passing out through the doors .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BELLE</speaker>
     <p>Come along , Ruth .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>THEY pass out and JINNY stands in the doorway talking to them till they are out of hearing .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Sh ! please do n't tell any one , not even Jinny , what I 've said ! I may be betraying something I 've no right to do , and do n't tell him I 've spoken to you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>All right !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>JINNY turns around in the doorway .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Thank you — and good-by .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Shaking his hand again .</stage>
    <stage>JINNY notices that they shake hands twice . A queer little look comes into her face .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Good-by .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Have they gone ?— Oh !<stage>Hurrying past JINNY .</stage>Good-by , dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She goes out through the double doors .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a curious little voice .</stage>Good-by ....</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She comes slowly down the room toward AUSTIN , and smiles at him quizzically . ] What were you two saying ?</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Good-by !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>But you 'd said it once to her already ! Why did you have to say good-by twice to Ruth ? Once was enough for all the other girls !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Banteringly .</stage>The first time I said good-by to her , and the second time she said good-by to me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Do you know what I believe — Ruth Chester 's in love with you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Oh , darling !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Laughs .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Yes , that explains the whole thing . No wonder she was triste to-day .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laughing .</stage>Jinny , sweetheart , do n't get such an absurd notion into your head .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looks straight at him a moment , then speaks tenderly .</stage>No — no — I know it 's not your fault . There was no other woman in this house for you to-day but me , was there ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>There was no other woman in the world for me since the first week I knew you .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Taking her into his arms .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>This is good-by to Jinny Tillman !<stage>He kisses her .</stage>Jack , darling , do you think I could sit on your knee like a little child and put my arm around your neck and rest my head on your shoulder for just five seconds — I 'm so tired !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MRS. CULLINGHAM opens the door .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>Oh !</p>
    </sp>

    <stage>JINNY and AUSTIN laugh .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes — come in !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MRS. CULLINGHAM enters . She is a handsome , whole-souled , florid woman ; one of those creatures of inexhaustible vitality who make people of a nervous temperament tired almost on contact by sheer contrast . She is the kindest , best meaning creature in the world .</stage>

     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>Oh , do excuse me ! I have n't any more tact !— and I hate to interrupt you , but I must say good-by .<stage>Calls .</stage>Peter !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Yes 'm .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Entering with a glass of water and a powder . He sits in the arm-chair at right , and constantly looks at his watch .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>I 'm much obliged to you , Mrs. Cullingham , for the interruption , as I was sent long ago to make myself ready for the train , if you 'll excuse me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>Certainly !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Good-by !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Taking his hand as he passes her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Good-by !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out Right .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>If it 's time for him , it 's certainly time for you . I wo n't keep you a minute !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>No , really we 've plenty of time ,—<stage>both sit on sofa .</stage>Was n't it a lovely wedding !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>I never saw a sweeter , my dear ! And it was perfectly elegant ! Simply great !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>And is n't Jack —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>He is ! And so are you ! In fact I 've been telling your mother I do n't know how to thank you both . You 've asked me to-day to meet the swellest crowd I 've ever been in where I was invited , and did n't have to buy tickets , and felt I had a right to say something besides “ excuse me , ” and “ I beg your pardon . ” Of course , I 've sat next to them all before in restaurants and at concerts , but this time I felt like the real thing myself , and I shall never forget it ! If you or your husband ever want any mining tips , come to me ; what my husband do n't know about mines is n't worth knowing !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>I 'm as glad as I can be if you 've had a good time , and you must n't feel indebted to us . Ever since we met in Egypt that winter , mamma and I have always felt you were one of our best friends .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>Of course you know it is n't for my own sake I 'm doing these stunts to get into Society . It 's all for my boy . He 's got to have the best — or the worst , however you look at it !<stage>Laughing .</stage>Anyway , I want him to have a chance at it , and it belongs to him through his father , for my first husband was a real swell !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Looking at PETER lovingly .</stage>
    <stage>At this moment , PETER , having again looked at his watch , tips up the powder on his tongue , and swallows it down with the water .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>Poor darling ! He suffers terribly from indigestion . That 's an alkali powder he takes twenty minutes after eating . Peter , we must say good-by now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coming up .</stage>Good-by , Miss Jinny .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I 'll always be “ Miss Jinny ” to Peter !</p>

     <lg>
      <l>Thank you ! We 've had a great time at your wedding ! Bully food !</l>
      <l>But I 'm feeling it !</l>
      <stage>He turns aside .</stage>
      <l>Excuse me !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>I was just telling Mrs. Austin —</p>

     <p>Thank you —<stage>Rises to go .</stage>I was just saying we wo n't forget in our social life , will we , Peter , that Miss Jinny gave us the biggest boost up we 've had yet ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>JINNY also rises .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Well , you know , mother , I do n't think the game 's worth the candle . It 's begun to pall on me already .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>I really think he 's going to be superior to it !</p>

     <p>I should love them !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They go out through the doors at back .</stage>
    <stage>PETER is suffering with indigestion . He takes a charcoal tablet , and SUSIE cautiously enters Right .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SUSIE</speaker>
     <p>There you are ! Have you got ‘ em ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>No , I gave them back to you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SUSIE</speaker>
     <p>Then they 're in there on the table — get ‘ em quick , the trunks are coming down now !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PETER goes out quickly at back , as the BUTLER and MAN SERVANT enter Right , carrying a large new trunk with a portmanteau on top of it .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SUSIE</speaker>
     <p>Put them right over there for a minute !<stage>They put them down in the centre of the room , and the FOOTMAN goes out Right .</stage>And mind , you do n't split on us , Thomas . Auntie Tillman knows all about it — it 's just to be a nice little surprise for Cousin Jinny and my new uncle .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BUTLER</speaker>
     <p>Very well , miss .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He also goes out Right .</stage>
    <stage>At the same time PETER reënters at back with a roll of papers and some broad white satin ribbon . The papers are about half a foot broad and two feet long , and on them is printed , “ We are on our honeymoon . ”</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>With gay excitement .</stage>I 've got ‘ em .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>SUSIE</speaker>
     <p>Quick !<stage>Ties a big white bow on the portmanteau and on a trunk handle .</stage>If Auntie Tillman sees ‘ em , I 'll bet she 'll grab ‘ em off . She 'll be as mad as hops !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>I say is n't that great !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>SUSIE giggles aloud with delight . The BUTLER , standing at one side , smiles . They put another label on the other trunk .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SUSIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Giggling .</stage>I heard them plan it ,— they 're taking one old trunk purposely so as people would not catch on they were just married !</p>

     <p>Oh , up to Auntie Tillman 's room . Goodness knows what for ; it 's an awful bore ! Want to come along ?</p>
    </sp>

     <p>No , thank you ; but if you see your Cousin Jinny , you might tell her I am down .</p>

     <p>O my , what a fib ! And that 's a nice example to set a little girl !</p>

    <stage>She goes out Right .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coming forward .</stage>I beg pardon , sir , but may I speak to you a minute ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Certainly , Maggie , what is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p>I 've been trying for a chance to see you alone . I would n't bother you , sir — but it 's only because I 'm fond of Miss Jinny , and of Mr. and Mrs. Tillman , and they 've all been so good to me ; I know it would nearly kill ‘ em if they knew .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Come , Maggie , knew what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p>Well , one member of this family ai n't been good to me , sir .<stage>From this point her feelings begin to get the better of her and she speaks rapidly and hysterically .</stage>He 's been bad , bad as he could , and somebody 's got to talk to him , and I do n't see who 's a-goin ’ to do it but you . If he do n't change , I 'll not hold my tongue any longer . It 's all I can do for their sakes to hold it now !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Look here , what are you talking about ? You do n't mean Mr. Geoffrey ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I do , sir ; he 's my husband .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>What ! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p>We was married when he was at Yale , sir ; I was in a shop there .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>But —! Well , after all , is n't this your and Geoffrey 's affair ? Why bring me in ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p>Because he 's making love to Miss Chester , and promising to marry her now , and if he do n't stop — I 'll make trouble !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>But if he 's married to you , as you say — he can n't marry — any one else .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p>He 's tried to make me believe our marriage ai n't legal , because he was only twenty and he 'd been drinking !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>What makes you think Mr. Geoffrey cares for — Miss Chester ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p>I just heard and see him making love to her here !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>This is a pretty bad story , Maggie .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir , and the worst is , sir , I know I ai n't good enough for him , and that 's why I 've kept still about it these three years , but I can n't help loving him no matter how ugly he 's treated me .<stage>Breaking down into tears .</stage>I just can n't help it ! I love him , sir , even if I 'm only a servant girl , and I can n't stand it thinking he 's going to try and get rid of me for some one else !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She sobs out loud .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Sh !— Maggie . Sit down a minute , and control yourself . Somebody 'll hear you , and besides they 'll be coming down presently . I 'll have a talk with Mr. Geoffrey when I come back —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Interrupted as GEOFFREY enters Left . He does n't see MAGGIE , who is collapsed in a corner of the sofa .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p><stage>To AUSTIN .</stage>Ah ! Thank goodness I 've caught you ; I had an awful headache and went out for a breath of air , and then I was afraid I might have missed you ! I knew in that case Jinny would never forgive me , nor — I — myself — for that — matter —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>His voice grows less exuberant in the middle of his speech and finally at the end almost dies away , as he sees the expression in AUSTIN 'S face and realizes that something is wrong somewhere . When he stops speaking , MAGGIE gives a gasping sob . He hears it , and starting , sees her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>Maggie !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Geoffrey , is what this girl says true ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>That I married her in New Haven ? Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rises .</stage>I 'll go , please , I 'd rather go .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Yes , go , Maggie ; it 's better .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MAGGIE goes out Right .</stage>

     <p><stage>As soon as she is out of the room .</stage>Promise me , Jack , you wo n't tell any one ! It 's awful , I know ! For two years at college I went all to pieces and led a rotten life ,— and one night , drunk , I married her , and it is n't so much her fault . I suppose she thought I loved her ,— but this would break up the old lady and gentleman so , if they knew , I could n't stand it ! And Jinny , for God 's sake , do n't tell Jinny . She respects me . You wo n't tell her , will you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>No . But Maggie says you want to marry some one else now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a change , in great shame .</stage>That 's true , too .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He sits in utter dejection on the sofa .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>How are you going to do it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>I must make money somehow and buy off Maggie .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Yes , go out to Sioux Falls , get a divorce there on respectable grounds , and settle a sum of money on Maggie .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>But I can n't do that !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Why not ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>I can n't do anything that would give publicity , and that divorce would .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Any divorce would ; you can n't get rid of that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>I tell you I can n't have publicity . Ruth — Miss Chester — would hear of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Well , if she loves you , she 'll forgive your wild oats , especially as every one sees now what a steady , straight fellow you 've become .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>It 's Ruth ! But I can n't do that . No , Jack , you must help — you will , wo n't you ? Oh , do , for Jinny 's sake ! Help me to persuade Maggie to keep silent for good , tear up that certificate of marriage . I was only twenty ; it 's hardly legal , and I 'll settle a good sum —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Interrupted .</stage>

     <p><stage>Going straight to him , puts his hand heavily on his shoulder .</stage>Good God , you 're proposing bigamy ! You 've done enough ; do n't stoop to crime !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The two MEN face each other a moment . GEOFFREY 'S head drops .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Forget you ever said that ; do what I tell you when Jinny and I have gone abroad , so she will be away from it a little , and if you want money , let me know .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>JINNY enters Right , with nervous gaiety , covering an upheaving emotion which is very near the surface .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Ready ! And there you are , Geof . I 've been sending all over the house after you ! Good-by !<stage>Throwing her arms about him .</stage>Dear old Geof ! Have n't we had good times together ! Always , always from the youngest days I can remember — I do n't believe there were ever a brother and sister so sympathetic ; I know there was never a brother such a perfect darling as you were — I 'll miss you , Geof !<stage>The tears come into her voice , anyway .</stage>I used to think I 'd never marry at all if I could n't marry you , and I do think he is the only man in the world who could have taken me away from home , so long as you were there !<stage>To AUSTIN , smiling .</stage>You are n't jealous ?</p>

     <p><stage>In jest .</stage>Is n't it awful ! You can n't make him jealous ! I think it 's a positive flaw in his character ! Not like — us , is he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>Dear old girl —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Whispers to him .</stage>And I 've noticed how you 've overcome certain things , dear Geof . I know it 's been hard , and I 'm proud of you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>Sh ! Jinny , dear old sister ! I 'll miss you ! By George , Jin , the house 'll be awful without — but you —<stage>His voice grows husky .</stage>— just excuse me a minute !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He is about to break down , and so hurries out Right .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sniffling .</stage>He was going to cry ! Oh , Jack , you 'll be a brother to Geoffrey , wo n't you ? You know he 's been awfully dissipated , and he 's changed it all , all by himself ! If he should go wrong again — I believe it would break my heart , I love him so !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>I 'll do more for him , if he ever needs me , than if he were my own brother , because he 's yours !</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Presses his hand and looks up at him lovingly and gratefully .</stage>Thank you . Wait here just a minute ; I know he wo n't come back to say good-by . He 's gone up to his room , I 'm sure — I 'll just surprise him with a hug and my hands over his eyes like we used to do years ago .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She starts to go out Right , and meets MR. and MRS. TILLMAN , who enter .</stage>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Up to her brother .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>Her father 's been locked up in his study for three hours — he says thinking , but to me his eyes look very suspicious !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Taking her husband 's arm affectionately .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Clears his throat .</stage>Nonsense !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>Well , how many cigars did you smoke ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>Eight .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>The amount of emotion that a man can soak out of himself with tobacco is wonderful ! He uses it just like a sponge !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>Jack , the first thing I asked about you when I heard that — er — that things were getting this way was , does he smoke ? A man who smokes has always that outlet . If things go wrong — go out and smoke a cigar , and when the cigar 's finished , ten to one everything 's got right , somehow ! If you lose your temper , do n't speak !— a cigar , and when it 's finished , then speak ! You 'll find the temper all gone up in the smoke ! A woman 's happiness is safest with a man who smokes .<stage>He clears his throat , which is filling .</stage>God bless you , Jack , it is a wrench ; our only girl , you know . She 's been a great joy — ahem !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He quickly gets out a cigar .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Stopping him from smoking .</stage>No , no , dear , they 're going now !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>Well , the best I can say is , I wish you as happy a married life as her mother and I have had .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>Thirty-five dear years ! But now , George , let me say a word — you always have monopolized our new son — he 'll be much fonder of you than me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>Old lady !— Jealous !—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>Turn about is fair play — you 're jealous still of Jinny and me .<stage>She pauses a moment .</stage>I think we 'd better tell him !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>All right . The only rifts in our lute , Jack , have been little threads of jealousy that have snapped sometimes !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Nothing ever serious — of course , but it 's a fault that</l>
      <l>Jinny shares with us , and the only fault we 've ever been able to find .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>We called her for years the girl with the green eyes . She goes it pretty strong sometimes !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Oh , that 's all right — I shall like it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>You 'll always bear with her , wo n't you , if she should ever get jealous of you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Of me ? I 'll never give her the chance .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>It is n't a question of chance ; you just can n't help it sometimes , can you , George ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>No , you can n't .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>And so —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Do n't worry ! Your daughter 's safe with me . I 'm not the jealous sort myself and I love Jinny so completely , so calmly , and yet with my heart , and soul , and mind , and body , she 'll never have a chance even to try to be jealous of me !</p>
    </sp>

    <stage>JINNY enters Right .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>I found poor Maggie up in my room crying ! She says she can n't bear to have me go away . I think she 's sorry now she would n't come with me as maid — and I said good-by to cook and she sniffed !</p>
    </sp>

They come into the front room and stop , and for a second they look around the empty room . TILLMAN puts his hand in his pocket and takes out his cigar case . MRS.

    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Stupid !! Of course it does n't suggest anybody to me — I was only thinking I sympathized with Mrs. Perkins of Boston ,— do n't you know the old story about her ?</p>

     <p>No , darling , I mean who do you think Geoffrey says is over here and in Italy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>I have n't the most remote idea ! So far as I 've been able to observe there has been absolutely no one in Italy but you and me .</p>

     <p>Yes , I know , I did n't quite .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>But if you thought it was Ruth Chester , why not have said so ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>No reason , dear , I simply did n't think .</p>

     <speaker>MRS. LOPP</speaker>
     <p>Well , we must be in Room No . 3 or 4 — ai n't we ?</p>

     <p>This must be it , then ,— Diana ! Strong-looking woman , ai n't she ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CARRIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , very nice . You know she was the goddess who would n't let the men see her bathe .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. LOPP</speaker>
     <p>Mercy , Carrie ! and did all the other goddesses ? I do n't think much of their habits . I suppose this is the same person those Italians sell on the streets at home , and call the Bather .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>JINNY is secretly very much amused , finally she speaks .</stage>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. LOPP</speaker>
     <p>Oh , thank you very much . I guess we 've got mixed up with the rooms ,— seems as if there 's so many .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. LOPP</speaker>
     <p>Well , what with so many of the statues only being piecemeal , as it were , and so many of the men having kinder women 's hair , I declare it seems as if I do n't know the ladies from the gentlemen half the time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CARRIE</speaker>
     <p>Did the rest of us go through here ?</p>

     <p>I beg your pardon ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CARRIE</speaker>
     <p>Thirty-four people with a gassy guide ? We got so tired hearing him talk that we jes ’ sneaked off by ourselves , and now we 're a little scared about getting home ; we belong to the Cook 's Gentlemen and Ladies .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , no , the others have n't passed through here ; probably they have gone to see the pictures ; you 'd better go back and keep asking the attendants the way to the pictures till you get there .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. LOPP</speaker>
     <p><stage>With rather subdued voice .</stage>Thank you ! We 've come to do Europe and the Holy Land in five weeks for $ 400 — but I do n't know , seems as if I 'm getting awful tired — after jes ’ sevin days .</p>

     <speaker>CARRIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Affectionately .</stage>Now , mommer , do n't give up ; it 's because you have n't got over being seasick yet ; that 's all !</p>

     <p><stage>Helplessly .</stage>Oh , yes , you 'll find it much less tiring in a few days , I 'm sure .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>No , we have n't seen him ! Ruth and Peter are dawdling along , each on their own ; I like to shoot through a gallery . There 's no use spending so much time ; when it 's over you 've mixed everything all up just the same !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laughing .</stage>Well , I 've this minute read a letter from Geoffrey saying you were over here . And Jack , who thought he got a glimpse of you a little while ago , went straight off to try and find you .</p>

     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>What fun it is to see you — and how happy you look !</p>

     <p>Mr. Apollo ! Would you like to meet him ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hesitates .</stage>Er — no — I do n't think ! You must draw the line somewhere ! He would n't do a thing to Corbett , would he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Who was Corbett ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>He was a prize fighter , and is — but that 's another story — Do you mean to say you 've never heard of him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , the name sounds familiar . But this , you know , is Apollo .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>No , I do n't know ; was he a champion ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>No , he was a Greek god !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>Oh , was he ? Well , I would n't have cared about being in the tailoring business in those days , would you ? Let 's sit down .<stage>They sit on bench Right .</stage>Of course you know we would n't accept a thing like that in Peoria , where I come from , as a gift ! No , indeed ! If the King of Italy sent it over to our Mayor , he 'd return it C. O. D .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Sounds like Boston and the Macmonnies Bacchante !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>Oh , my dear , worse than that ! It reminds me of a man at home who kept an underclothing store in our principal street and had a plaster cast of this gent 's brother , I should think , in his window to show a suit of Jaegers on ,— you know , a “ combination ” ! And our Town Committee of Thirteen for the moral improvement of Peoria made the man take it out of his window and hang the suit up empty !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Poor man !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>You ought to see our Park !— you know we 've got a perfectly beautiful park ,— and all the men statues wear Prince Alberts , and stand like this —<stage>She poses with lifted arm at right angle to body .</stage>— as if they were saying , “ This way out ” or “ To the monkey cage and zoo . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laughing .</stage>But the women statues ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>My dear ! They only have heads and hands ; all the rest 's just clumps of drapery — we only have “ Americans ” and “ Libertys , ” anyway . They apply the Chinese emigration law to all Venuses and sich ladies !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They both laugh .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Where did you say Peter and Ruth were ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>Well , I left Peter — who is n't at all well ; I hoped this trip would help his indigestion , but it seems to have made it worse !— I left him — er — in a room with a lot of broken-up Venuses — I thought it was all right ; he was eating candy , and there was n't a whole woman among ‘ em !</p>

     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>Well , you know I always liked her . She never snubbed me in her life — I do n't think any one you 've introduced me to has been quite so nice to Peter and me as Mrs. Chester and her daughter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>O they are real people !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>Ruth is terribly depressed over something . She 's thin as a rail and the family are worried . She says there 's nothing worrying her , and the doctors can n't find anything the matter with her ,— so Mrs. Chester asked me if I would n't take her abroad . They thought the voyage and change might do her good , and I seem to have a more cheery influence over her than most people . So here we are !<stage>As PETER enters Left , eating .</stage>Here 's Peter ! How do you think the darling looks ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>How do you do , Mrs. Austin ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>How do you do , Peter ?<stage>They shake hands .</stage>I 'm sorry to hear you are seedy , but you eat too many sweet things .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>I 'm not eating candy ; it 's soda mints !<stage>Showing a small bottle .</stage>I am bad to-day , mother .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>If you do n't get better , we 'll go to Carlsbad .</p>

     <p>How do you like Rome , Peter ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I do n't know — too much Boston and not enough Chicago to make it a real lively town .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laughing .</stage>I think I 'll go look for Jack and tell him you 've turned up .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps he 's found Ruth .</p>

     <p><stage>With a change in her voice .</stage>Yes , perhaps .</p>

     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Going to the doorway Right , calls after her .</stage>Ruth 's in a room on your left , with rows of men 's heads on shelves , Emperors and things ,— but gee , such a job lot !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Comes back and looks up at the statue .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>Is n't it beautiful , Peter ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>No , it 's too big !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>Still this one is n't broken !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>That 's a comfort ! Yes , it has been mended , too !<stage>Examining .</stage>Oh , yes , it 's only another of these second-hand statues . Say , you missed one whole one , the best I 've seen yet ! A Venus off in a fine little room , all mosaics and painted walls ,— that 's where I 've been .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>Why , Peter Cullingham ! Alone ? What kind of a Venus ?</p>

     <p>We — you know — she had been , but she 'd sort of pushed it a good way off !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a sigh .</stage>You know we ought to admire these things , Peter darling ; that 's partly what we 've come to Europe for !</p>

They drag their tired feet in a listless shuffle across the room and stand in a somewhat sheepish and stupid bunch at the statue . One or two of the younger women nudge each other and giggle . The GUIDE stands a little in advance of them . The GUIDE describes the statue , and while he is doing so PETER and MRS. CULLINGHAM go out Right . Most of the TOURISTS turn and watch them go instead of looking at the statue .</stage>

     <p>This is the Apollo Belvedere , discovered at the end of the fifteenth century , some say in a Roman villa or farm-house near the Grotter Terratter . Very fine specimen both as marble and man . This statyer is calculated to make Sandow et cetery look like thirty cents . Height seven feet , weight —</p>

     <speaker>GUIDE</speaker>
     <p>Give it up ! Should judge he was . The god once held a bow in his left hand and probably a laurel wreath in his right .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>ANOTHER WOMAN TOURIST</speaker>
     <p>A what ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>GUIDE</speaker>
     <p>A laurel wreath . You want to take a good look at this , as it is a very fine piece . Now come along , please — make haste ; we must finish up this place before feeding !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He leads the way out Right , and the TOURISTS follow , shuffling along , without speaking , MRS. LOPP and CARRIE lagging in the rear .</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN enters Left , followed by RUTH .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>This is where I left her with Apollo !<stage>Calls .</stage>Jinny ! She seems to have gone !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He looks behind the statue and out door , Right .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Probably the Cullinghams , who were headed in this direction , found her , and they 've all gone back for us ; you see I walked all around the court first without going into the rooms , so I missed them , but found you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>What shall we do ? Sit down here and wait for them to come back , or shall I go in search ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , no , you might miss them , and then we 'd all be lost ! If you left Jinny here , she 's sure to come back to meet you .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She sits on the bench and AUSTIN stands behind her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sorry to learn you 've been ill .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Oh ! it 's nothing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Ah , I 'm afraid it 's a good deal . Will you forgive me if I say I think I know what it is !<stage>She looks up startled .</stage><stage>After a moment .</stage>You have n't forgotten the day of Jinny 's and my wedding , when you told me Geoffrey Tillman needed a friend ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>I hoped you 'd forgotten ; I ought n't to have told you ; I ought n't to have !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Why not ? I had a talk with Geoffrey , then , and he told me everything .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>He did ! You are sure ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Sure .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He sits beside her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>That he and I —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Love each other .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , but that is n't all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>I know the rest !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>He told you — about — about —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>The marriage ?— Yes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I 'm so glad , so glad ! Now I can speak of it to some one , and some one who can advise me , and will help us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>I have already advised him , but he does n't seem to be taking my advice ; it has worried me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>When I left he was awfully depressed . He said he saw no prospect of being able to publish our marriage for years , maybe !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>What marriage ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>In astonishment .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Our marriage , in Brooklyn !<stage>She notices his expression and is alarmed .</stage>You said he had told you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Recovering himself , and speaking at first with hesitation .</stage>Yes , but not the details , not — wait , I 'm a little confused .<stage>Rising and walking a moment .</stage>Let 's get it all quite clear now , that 's the only way I can help you — both ; I ought , of course , to have gone through it all with him , but there really was n't time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>I can n't go on like this much longer . It 's killing me to deceive mother ; I must tell her soon !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quickly , stops walking .</stage>No . You must n't , not yet , if I 'm going to help you ; you 'll obey me , wo n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Yes , if you only will help us !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>You said you and Geoffrey Tillman were married where ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>In Brooklyn .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>When ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>A month before your wedding .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>To himself .</stage>It 's impossible !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Walking up and down .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling sadly .</stage>Oh , no ! I remember the date only too well .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>I did n't mean that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>I lied to my mother that day for the first time — at any rate , since I was a child — and I 've been lying to her ever since .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Probing her .</stage>But — but why were you married so secretly ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>We could n't afford to marry and set up for ourselves . He expected then to be sent off at once to the Philippines , and — well he did n't want to leave me behind , free ; I 'm afraid he 's rather jealous — you must have found out by now that Jinny is . They all are ! And I did n't want him to go so far off without my belonging to him either ; I 'm that jealous , too !<stage>Smiling .</stage>So — that 's why !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>And this long period of secrecy since then — do you understand that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Ruth . Has n't he explained to you his debts ? You know before he loved me he was very fast , but since —</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I know how he gave up every one of his old habits with a great deal of courage .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Nobody knows what it cost him ! How can you help us ? Get him something to do to pay off his debts ? Or can n't you make him feel even if we do have to go on living at our different homes for a while , it is better to publish the fact that we are married ?—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>I shall go back at once to America if I can persuade Jinny !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>And I , too ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>No . You must stay abroad till I send word for you to come home . If I am going to help you , you will help me by doing exactly as I say , wo n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>It 's very important that you should absolutely obey me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>I will .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>A pause .</stage>
    <stage>JINNY , unnoticed by either of them , appears in the doorway at Right . AUSTIN is walking up and down . RUTH is leaning her elbow on the back of the bench and burying her face in her hands .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>It 's awful ! My God , it 's awful !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a strained , assumed , nonchalant tone .</stage>What is ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Jinny !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Rising .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>I did n't hear you , Jinny !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>No , you both seemed so absorbed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Going to JINNY .</stage>I 'm so glad to see you .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Kisses her , but JINNY only gives her her cheek and that rather unwillingly ; she is looking all the time at her husband .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Thank you , I 've just left the Cullinghams . They sent word to you they were going and would wait for you outside .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUTH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , then , I must n't keep them waiting . We 'll all meet at dinner to-night , wo n't we ? Good-by — good-by .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>With a grateful look at AUSTIN , she goes out Right .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Watches her go ; then turns to AUSTIN .</stage>That was n't true , what I told her — I have n't seen the Cullinghams , and I do n't know where they are , and what 's more , I do n't care !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>What do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Beginning by degrees to lose control of herself .</stage>What did she mean by following you to Rome ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Jinny !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , do n't try to deny it ; that 'll only make me suspect you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>My dear girl , you do n't know what you 're saying !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>She 's ill , they say at home ! Yes , and they do n't know what 's the matter with her , do they ? No ! But I can tell them ! She 's in love with another woman 's husband !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taking her hand .</stage>Hush ! I wo n't allow you to say such things !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a disagreeable little laugh .</stage>Oh , wo n't you ? You 'd better be careful ,— my eyes are opened !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Yes , and much too wide .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>A half-blind person would have known there was something between you two . When I came into this room just now , it was in the air — it was in both your faces !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She sits on the bench .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>You 've worked yourself up to such a pitch you 're not responsible for what you 're saying !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>I not responsible ! What was it you were saying was so “ awful ” when I came in here ? “ My God , so awful ! ”<stage>He does n't answer .</stage><stage>Almost hysterical , she rises .</stage>She had told you she loved you ! She 'd confessed she 'd followed you over here !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Absolutely false , both your suppositions !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , of course you 'd protect her ; you 're a gentleman ! But if I thought you knew she was coming over —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Jinny ! Jinny ! How can you have such a thought ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Well , why did n't you tell me when you thought you saw her a little while ago ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Oh —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , it 's very easy to say “ Oh ! ”<stage>Imitating him .</stage>but why did n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>I told you I did n't think who it was ; I only thought something familiar flashed across my eyes . Jinny darling , this is sheer madness on your part , letting yourself go like this . It has no reason , it has no excuse ! Ask your own heart , and your own mind , if in speaking to me as you have , you have n't done me at least an injustice and my love for you a little wrong .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Well , I 'm sure she 's in love with you , anyway .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>No , she is n't ! And it 's disgraceful of you to say so ! I know she is n't —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>How do you know she is n't ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>There 's no question of it . I 'm sure of it ! You must n't think , dear , that because you love me , everybody does — you idealize me !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Smiling apologetically .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , you 're so modest you do n't see ! but I do — on the steamer , in the hotels , everywhere we go , always , all the women admire you awfully ! I see it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Laughing .</stage>
      <l>What utter nonsense !</l>
      <stage>Taking her into his arms .</stage>
      <l>You 've got something in your eyes !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Only tears !</p>

     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>No , something else ,— something green .</p>
    </sp>

     <p><stage>Laughs through her tears .</stage>Somebody 's told you my old nickname !</p>

     <p>What ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>Ahem !—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>Well , I do n't care if it is appropriate , I can n't help it .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Slipping from his arms .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>You must — or it will threaten our happiness if you let yourself be carried away by jealousy for no earthly reason outside of your dear , little imagination , like you have this time —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Interrupted .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>You honestly do n't think she cares for you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Not a bit !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>But what was it you were so serious about — what is between you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>She is in a little trouble , and I happen to know about it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>How ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>After a second 's hesitation .</stage>That you must n't ask me ; it was not from her I knew of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Truly ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Truly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>I do n't care , she had n't any business to go to you ! I should think she 'd have gone to a woman instead of a man for sympathy . She 's got Mrs. Cullingham !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>She can n't go to her , poor girl . Mrs. Cullingham knows nothing about it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Now do n't you get too sympathetic — that 's very dangerous !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Look out , your imagination is peeping through the keyhole .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>A moment 's pause .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a sympathetic tone , the jealousy gone .</stage>What is her trouble , Jack ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>That , dear , I can n't tell you now ; some day , perhaps , if you want me to , but not now . Only I give you my word of honor , it has nothing to do with you and me — does not touch our life ! And I want you to tell me you believe me , and trust me , and wo n't let yourself be jealous again !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>I do believe you , and I do trust you , and I will try not to be jealous again !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>That 's right .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>You know that book of De Maupassant 's<stage>They move away together .</stage>I was reading in the train the other day ,— about the young girl who killed herself with charcoal fumes when her lover deserted her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Half laughing .</stage>This is apropos of what , please ? I have absolutely no sympathy with such people .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>In America that girl would have simply turned on the gas .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>You 're getting morbid , Jinny !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>No , I 'm not ! but if ever —</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Interrupting — laughing it off .</stage>I shall install electric light as soon as we get home !</p>

    <stage>They both laugh .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sorry I was so disagreeable to Ruth , but I 'll try to make up for it in every way I can .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She sits on the bench and he leans over the back toward her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>There 's one other thing , Jinny , I 'd like to speak of now . Would you mind giving up the Lakes and going home this week ?</p>

     <p>Going home — at once ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Yes — Wall Street is very uncertain . I 'm worried ,— I do n't mind telling you ,— and I want to see Geoffrey about his business .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Half in earnest .</stage>Jack ! You 're not running away from her , are you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Jinny ! After all we 've said !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>No ! I was n't in earnest ! I 'm ready to go . I 've seen the Lakes , and whether you are in Italy or in New York , so long as we are together , it 's our honeymoon just the same .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>And may it last all our lives !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Still , I do n't mind owning up that leaving Ruth Chester behind here is rather pleasanter !<stage>She rises quickly with a sudden thought .</stage>She is not going back , too ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Oh , no , not for a long time . They are over here indefinitely .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>I 've been too horrid and nasty for words this morning , Jack — I 'm so sorry .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>It 's over and forgotten now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>You do forgive me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Of course , dear ; only I want to say this one thing to you : to suspect unjustly a true love is to insult that love !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>I did n't really suspect you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Of course I know you did n't ; this is only by way of a grandfatherly warning ! It is possible to insult a true love too often — and love can die —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Sh ! do n't , please , say any more . You have forgiven me , have n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Yes !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Then kiss me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>Here ! My dear , some one will see us !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>No , only Apollo ; see , there 's no one else about — it 's luncheon hour !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>But —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Taking her hand .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pulling him .</stage>Come along , then , behind the statue . No one will see us there !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They are behind the statue a moment and then come around the other side .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>There ! no one saw us , and I 'm so happy , are you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>“ So happy ! ”</p>

    <stage>JINNY takes his arm and they go to the Left entrance . She stops and looks up at him .</stage>

There is a double window at the back . A door at Right leads to the hall , and another on the Left side of the room leads to JINNY 's own room . MRS.

JINNY enters from Left , singing as her mother plays .</stage>

     <p>Darling mother !</p>

    <stage>She puts her arms about her and kisses her .</stage>
    <stage>They come away from the pianola together , to a big arm-chair .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>I really must get one of those sewing-machine pianos for your father . I believe even he could play it , and it would be lots of amusement for us .</p>

     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Jack adores it ; I gave it to him for an anniversary present .</p>

     <p>What anniversary ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Sitting in the chair .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Day before yesterday . The eleventh Tuesday since our marriage . Have you been in town all day ? I am glad to see you !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She sits on the arm of the chair with her arm about her mother .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>Yes , and I told your father to meet me here and we 'd take the six-thirty train from Long Island City .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Jack and I are going to the theatre to-night .</p>

     <p>I thought they were all closed !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , no , there are several musical comedies on ,— Jack 's favorite form of amusement ,— and I 've bought the tickets myself for a sort of birthday party .</p>

     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>We 've been home two weeks and it has n't been hot yet .</p>

     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>And you 're still ideally happy are n't you , darling ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Yes —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She rises and goes to a table near the centre of the room and looks at the titles of several books without realizing what they are .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>Why , Jinny ,— what does that mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , it 's all my horrid disposition !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>Been seeing green ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Um ! Um ! Once in Rome , and on the steamer , and again since we 've been back .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>Nothing serious ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hesitatingly , she turns and faces her mother .</stage>No — but the last time Jack was harder to bring around than before , and he looked at me for fully five minutes without a particle of love in his eyes , and they were almost — dead eyes !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>What was it all about ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Ruth Chester , principally .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>Why Ruth ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Well , the first real scene I made was in Rome in the Vatican . I was jealous of her ; I can n't explain it all to you — as a matter of fact , it has n't been all explained to me ! Something was troubling Ruth that Jack knew , and he said he 'd help her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>What ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>That 's just it ; Jack wo n't tell me . And the day we sailed from Naples a telegram came , and of course I opened it , and it said , “ Trust me , I will do everything you say . Ruth . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>Why have n't you told me anything of all this before , dear ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Going back to her mother .</stage>I was ashamed to ! Somehow , in the end I always knew I was wrong and had hurt him — hurt him terribly , mother , the man I love better than everything else in the world ! Yes , even better than you and father and Geoffrey — all together !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>In her mother 's arms , crying a little .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>Oh , this curse of jealousy ! I was in hopes he was so strong he would help you to overcome it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>He does try hard , I can see sometimes ; but he has n't a spark of it in him , and he can n't understand it , and I know I 'm unreasonable , and before I know it I am saying things I do n't know what , and some day he wo n't forgive them ! I 'm sure some day he wo n't !—</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Breaking down again .</stage>
    <stage>She rises and turns away .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rising and putting her arms about her .</stage>Come , dear ! Now you 're getting yourself all unstrung , and that wo n't do you any good ; you 've got to fight this battle out , I 'm afraid , by yourself , trusting in the deep love of your husband to teach him forbearance . Your father 's and my troubles were never very big because we shared the curse , so we knew how to sympathize with each other !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>What an awful thing it is !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>Yes , my dear child . Jealousy has no saving grace , and it only destroys what is always most precious to you . Jinny , do n't let it destroy your best happiness !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Mother , if it should , I 'd kill myself !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Shocked , but quite disbelieving her .</stage>My dear !</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know that I shall tell him at all ; he would only advise more cigars !</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Going to meet him .</stage>We are , father dear , and your presence almost completes us .<stage>Kisses him .</stage>I say almost , because Jack has n't come up town yet , and Geoffrey 's heartless enough to stay on fishing at Cape Cod !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>No , he is n't ; he 's back to-day .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He sits in the arm-chair at Right .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I do want to see him !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Sitting near her father .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>He ought to have been in by now — I met them this morning . He was to lunch with Jack , and he 's going to put up for a few days at the University .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>He must dine with us every night .</p>

     <speaker>TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>Jinny !—<stage>Looking at her .</stage>— You look as if you 've been crying !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The two WOMEN are embarrassed , and JINNY does n't reply .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hurt .</stage>Oh , if you prefer to have secrets from your father , it 's all right ! I do n't begrudge your mother her first place in your affections !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Not at all , father ; with you and mother there 's no first place . She will tell you all about it on the way home ! Please , mother .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>Very well , dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>A little “ scrap ” between you and Jack ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>Yes , but it 's all over !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>Um !—<stage>Thinks a second , then taking out his cigar case , he empties it of cigars and hands them to JINNY .</stage>Give your husband these , please , when he comes in !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>JINNY and her MOTHER exchange a smile .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>But , father , Jack 's got boxes full —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>Never mind ; give him those , from me , with my compliments !</p>

     <p>Such a nice girl !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>And was n't it odd Jack was bitterly opposed to my taking her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>My dear , if we had n't lent her to you for these few weeks , you would n't have got anybody decent for so short a time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>Why did n't Jack want her to come ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know , he just did n't want her ; and then last week he talked with her in the library for three-quarters of an hour by my watch .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>Why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , it seems she has troubles , too ! All single young women with troubles , of no matter what class , seem to make a bee line for my husband , even if they have to cross the ocean !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>What do you mean ?</p>

     <p>Except , of course , for poor Peter ; he gets worse every trip ! He can eat absolutely nothing — that is for long ! But it 's the Custom House that 's worn me out ; I was there from twelve till four .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>But you would n't have had time to buy anything !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>Of course not ! But I took plenty of new dresses for the entire summer ; most of them had n't been worn , and they were determined to make me pay duty .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>We had to pay awfully for things ! I wanted to try and smuggle , but Jack would n't let me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MR. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>I 'm afraid we must go !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>ALL rise .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>What do you think the Inspector had the impudence to ask me finally ,— if I wanted to bring the dresses in as theatrical properties !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They laugh .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>You must have some gorgeous frocks !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>Oh , there are some paillettes ! But who do you suppose he took me for — Sarah Bernhardt !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking at his watch .</stage>I do n't wish to interrupt this vital political conversation , but , Susan , if you do n't want to miss the seven-two train , too —!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rising .</stage>Oh , no , we must n't do that . Good-by .<stage>To MRS. CULLINGHAM , shaking hands .</stage>It 's nice to see you again , anyway . Is Ruth better ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sorry to say — I do n't think she is — good-by .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>To MR. TILLMAN , who says good-by — general good-bys .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p><stage>To JINNY .</stage>You want me to tell your father ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Yes , it 's better ; it does make him jealous if he thinks I tell you things and keep secrets from him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TILLMAN</speaker>
     <p>Good-by , Peter .</p>

     <p>Good-by , Peter .</p>

     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>By-by .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MR. and MRS. TILLMAN quickly go out Right , JINNY going to the door with them .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coming back from doorway .</stage>Now do tell me what it means . I thought you were abroad indefinitely , or for the summer at least .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>So did I ! I 'm just as surprised to be here as you seem to be !<stage>They sit down near each other .</stage>Did n't you really know we were coming ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>No ! How should I ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know — I thought —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She hesitates , embarrassed .</stage>
    <stage>After a pause .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>What did you think ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>Nothing , except that you must know we were coming home .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Why — that I must ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>You must n't put me into a corner like that !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>How do you mean “ corner ” ? How did you happen to come home like this ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>Ruth suddenly got a cable — she did n't tell me from whom — but she said she must go home at once .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>But her mother 's never been better !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Carelessly .</stage>The cable was n't from her mother .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , then , you know who it was from ?<stage>No answer .</stage>Oh , I see now why you thought I ought to know about it ; the cable was from Jack , was n't it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Relieved .</stage>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , it was !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>I looked at it when she was out of the room ; of course , it was sort of by accident —<stage>Very much embarrassed .</stage>— that is , I just happened to see — O dear , there ! You know what I mean ; it was dreadful of me , but I could n't help it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a strained voice .</stage>Jack and Ruth are very good friends and he looks after some of her affairs . You know having no man in the family complicates things .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Oh ! I say !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Standing up , suddenly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>What is it , dear ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>I believe I have n't got my before-dinner tabs .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>Oh , look carefully !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>He looks in his right-hand pocket , takes out a bottle .</stage>Soda mints !<stage>From his left-hand pocket a box .</stage>Alkali powders !<stage>From third pocket a bottle .</stage>Charcoal tablets !<stage>From fourth pocket another bottle .</stage>Dr. Man 's Positive Cure !<stage>From fifth pocket a box .</stage>Bicarbonate soda !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>There 's your other side pocket !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>That 's my saccharine<stage>Showing bottle .</stage>and my lithia tabs .<stage>Showing another bottle .</stage>We 'll have to go , mother ; I 've left them home !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>We must go , anyway , my dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Rising .</stage>
    <stage>JINNY also rises .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Suddenly claps his hand behind him and speaks joyfully .</stage>No , we need n't go after all ; I forgot my hip pocket . Here they are !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Bringing them out .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>We must go all the same !<stage>To JINNY .</stage>Sometimes I think he takes too much medicine stuff !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>I should think so ! Peter , you ought to diet .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>I can n't ! I 've tried , and I lose my appetite right away !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>Good-by , dear . How long will you be in town ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know — several weeks , I imagine . Jack came home on some business , you know , and I do n't think it 's settled yet . Good-by .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>To PETER .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Good-by . You know you must n't drink water with your meals ; that 's the great thing . So I drink only champagne .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out Right .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Waits and speaks to JINNY with real feeling .</stage>I 'm awfully ashamed of myself , and I hope I have n't made any trouble or fuss with my meddling . Do n't let me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>No , of course not .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>With a strained smile .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>I wish I could believe you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Well , do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CULLINGHAM</speaker>
     <p>Good-by .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She goes out Right .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Good-by . Where 's that telegram that came for him a little while ago ?<stage>Going to the desk at Right , and finding the telegram .</stage>Of course it 's from her , saying that she 's arrived . That 's the trouble with telegrams ; the address does n't give the handwriting away . She must have sent it from the dock ! Could n't even wait till she was home !<stage>She walks to the window and stands there a moment , then comes back , looking at her watch .</stage>Nearly seven already , and no sign of him , and we must dress and dine — huh ! I think I might as well tear up my theatre tickets !<stage>She paces up and down the room , stopping now and then with each new thought that comes to her .</stage>I wonder if he went down there to meet her — he must have known the boat ; if he cabled her to come back , she must have cabled an answer and what boat she 'd take ! But no other telegram has come for Jack here to my knowledge — oh ! of course , what am I thinking of , she sent that one to his office to-day ; she was afraid he might have left before this one could get there , so she risked it here . Good Heavens ! why am I maudling on like this to myself out loud ? It 's really nothing — Jack will explain once more that he can n't explain , but that Ruth has “ troubles , ” and I 'll believe him again ! But I wo n't ! He promised me she should stay over there !<stage>Looks at her watch again .</stage>He 's there , with her ! Nothing ever kept him half as late down town as this ! What a little fool I am !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>GEOFFREY enters suddenly Right .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Cries out , joyfully .</stage>Geoffrey !<stage>And rushing to him , embraces him .</stage>You brute , you , not to come straight back to New York when you heard I was home ! You dear old darling , you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>I could n't , old girl ; there were reasons — I do n't have to tell you I wanted to .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know ! Was there a pretty girl up there , Geof ? I 'm sure I should n't think her pretty if you were in love with her . I believe I shall be awfully jealous of your wife when you get one !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>Rubbish ! Has n't Jack come back yet ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>“ Come back ” from where ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>Brooklyn .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Brooklyn ! Why , he told me — what did he go there for ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Embarrassed .</stage>I do n't know if you do n't —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>You do ! !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>No — really — I —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , it 's something to be concealed , then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>Hang it , Jinny ! drop the subject . I thought he said he was going to Brooklyn ; probably I was mistaken .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Satirically .</stage>One is so apt to think just casually that every one 's going to Brooklyn !<stage>Looks at her watch .</stage>Of course it 's Brooklyn .<stage>Goes and looks at the telegram ; turns .</stage>So you 're going back on me , too , are you ? You 're going to protect Jack at my expense !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>AUSTIN enters Right .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Absorbed .</stage>Good evening , Jinny dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>It 's after seven !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pleasantly .</stage>Is it ? Have you been waiting long , Geoffrey ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>No , I 've only just now come in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>It 's I who have done the waiting !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sorry , but it could n't be helped .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>You did n't tell me you were going to Brooklyn .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>After a quick , sharp look at Geoffrey , who shakes his head once emphatically .</stage>It must have escaped my mind .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>That 's very likely ! Going to Brooklyn 's the sort of thing one talks about and dreads for days .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Well , Jinny , that will bear postponement , and my conversation with Geoffrey wo n't ; will you please leave us together here for a while ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>And what about the theatre ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>What theatre ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , you 've forgotten entirely my little birthday party ! Thanks !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Jinny ! I did ! Forgive me ! I 'm awfully sorry ! I 've got a lot on my mind to-day .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Tries to put his arms about her and kiss her . She pushes herself away from him , refusing to let him kiss her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Yes — I know you have —<stage>At door Left .</stage>— I 'll leave you two to your confidences . You can trust Geof ; he just now refused to betray you .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>AUSTIN only looks at her fixedly , seriously . She looks back at him with bravado . Then she deliberately crosses the room , gets the cable , and recrosses with it and goes out Left .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Poor Jinny !<stage>Turning to GEOFFREY .</stage>and that , too , lies largely on your already overcrowded shoulders .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Breaking down .</stage>I know ! I know !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sitting in the corner of the sofa .</stage>Here , do n't cry ! You 've got to be strong now , and you 've no use nor time for crying . I 've had another long interview with the Brooklyn minister .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>Yes ?—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Drawing a chair near to him and sitting .</stage>Well , of course we both know that he 's doing wrong to keep silent , but he will . He wishes I had n't told him , because he thinks he 'd never have noticed your divorce from Maggie when it was granted — nor remembered your name if he had seen it in the papers .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>That 's what I told you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>You only argued that for fear I 'd insist on your going to this minister yourself . But in the bottom of your heart you know it was a risk we could n't afford to run . I 've explained everything to him — how such a fine , sweet girl would suffer if he did expose you , and I gave him my word you would be remarried to Ruth at once after the divorce . Of course we both know it 's wrong , but we both hope the end justifies the means that removes difficulty number two .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>You 're sure about Maggie ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>She 's signed a paper ; she realizes you 'll never live with her , and — it 's pathetic — she loves you — that girl , too — so much as to give you your freedom — Good Lord ! what is it about you weak men that wins women so ? What is it in you that has made two women love you to such a self-sacrificing extent ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Half tragic , half comic laugh .</stage>I give it up !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Bitterly .</stage>So do I . Well , Maggie is to have six hundred dollars a year .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>Where 'll I get it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>We 'll talk about that when the time comes .<stage>He rises .</stage>Now the most important , the most painful , task of all must be done and you must do it . Not I this time — you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking up , frightened .</stage>What ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Ruth Chester landed this morning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Starting up .</stage>Impossible !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Rising .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>The moment Maggie signed my paper I cabled Miss Chester to return . You can n't go out west and institute proceedings for divorce without her knowing the whole truth from you first ! You do n't want her to find it out from the newspapers , do you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>And you want me to tell her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>To-day . And to-morrow you start west !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Facing AUSTIN .</stage>I wo n't tell her !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Calmly .</stage>You 've got to !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Geoffrey . I 'd rather shoot myself ; do you understand me — I 'd rather shoot myself !</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>That 's nothing ! That would be decidedly the easiest course out of it , and the most cowardly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>She 'll hate me ! She 'll loathe me ! How could she help it at first ! But just after a little , if I were n't there , the love she has for me might move her somehow or other — and by degrees perhaps — to forgive —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>I do n't deny that you will have to go through a terrible degradation with her — but that is nothing compared with what you deserve . If you tell her , at least the humiliation is secret , locked there between you two , and no one else in the world can ever know what happens ; but if you send some one else , and no matter who ,— any one else but you is an outsider ,— you ask her to make a spectacle of her humiliation , to let a third in as witness to the relations and emotions between you two ! It 's insulting her again ! Do n't you see ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>A pause .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I see ! My God ! I must tell her myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>That 's right , do n't waver , make up your mind and do it — Come !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Urging him up .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hesitates a moment .</stage>And Jinny ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Oh , she 'll come round all right ; she always does .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>And she does n't suspect ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Not the slightest .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>A pause .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>Need she ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>The worst ? No , never !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p><stage>He rises , with new encouragement .</stage>You 'll give me your word ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Yes .<stage>Shakes his hand .</stage>I know how much she loves you ; I would n't have her know anything . It 's made us some ugly scenes , but they soon pass , and when you are once out of your trouble for good , we 'll have no excuse , I 'm sure , for any more !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>Then I shall go to bed to-night with the respect still of at least two women who are dear to me , my mother and Jinny , even if I lose the respect and love of the one woman who is dearer ! Only think , Jack , how I 've got to stand up there — never mind about myself — and make her suffer tortures ! Good-by . God give me courage to do the heart-breaking thing I must do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>I am sure the one hope you have of forgiveness is in your manliness of going to her as you are doing and telling her yourself all the truth !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GEOFFREY</speaker>
     <p>And that , like everything else , I owe to you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>No , to Jinny ! Good luck !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He shakes GEOFFREY 'S hand and GEOFFREY goes out Right .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Goes to the door Left , opens it , and calls to JINNY , in the next room .</stage>Jinny , Geoffrey 's gone ,— what are you doing ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Answers in a very little staccato voice .</stage>Waiting till you should have the leisure to receive me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Come along !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Leaves the doorway .</stage>
    <stage>JINNY enters Left and stands in the doorway .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>With affected nonchalance .</stage>I did n't care to go downstairs for dinner , so I have had a tray up here . Maggie brought up something for you , too ; would you like it now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Ignoring purposely her mood and manner .</stage>I should n't mind ! I do feel a little hungry .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He sits in the arm-chair .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Speaks off through the doorway Left .</stage>
      <l>Bring in the tray for</l>
      <l>Mr. Austin , Maggie .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Off stage .</stage>Yes 'm .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>JINNY pulls forward a little tea table beside his chair . Her whole manner must be one of slow , dragging carelessness , like the calm before a storm . Her expression must be hard . She carries the telegram still unopened , and on top of it the theatre tickets torn into pieces .</stage>
    <stage>MAGGIE brings in the tray , puts it on the table , and goes out Right . On the tray are chops , peas , some whiskey , a syphon , a roll , etc .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sits down quickly and with a show of eagerness .</stage>Ah !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Begins to eat as if he were hungry and enjoyed it .</stage>
    <stage>JINNY sits on the sofa at his Left , and looks at him ,— AUSTIN is of course conscious of JINNY 'S mood , but pretends not to notice it .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>After a silence during which he eats .</stage>I say I am hungry ! And these chops are very good , are n't they ?<stage>No answer .</stage>I 'll tell you what it is , Jinny ! Of course travelling is great sport and all the rest of it , but after all one does get tired of hotels , and to quote a somewhat familiar refrain , “ There 's no place like home . ”<stage>No answer .</stage>Have you a headache , Jinny ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Very short .</stage>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>That 's a good thing , and I hope you are not as disappointed as I am about the theatre .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Half laughs .</stage>Humph !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>I 'll celebrate your birthday to-morrow and take you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quickly .</stage>Why did you go to Brooklyn ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>On the private business of some one else .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>With all her nerves tied tight .</stage>That 's the best answer you will give me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>My dear girl , it 's the only answer I can give you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>When you are through I have something for you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>What ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>I 'll give it to you when you have finished .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>I 'm ready .<stage>He rises . JINNY rises too , and gives him the telegram with the torn tickets on top , and then rings the bell , at Right .</stage>What are these torn papers ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Our theatre tickets !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He looks at her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>And when did this telegram come ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>This afternoon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Why did n't I get it when I came in ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Bitingly .</stage>I kept it to have the pleasure of giving it to you myself ; it 's from Ruth Chester .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>How do you know ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I have n't opened it ! But I know ! When I held it in my hand it burnt my fingers !<stage>MAGGIE enters Right .</stage>Take away the tray , please , Maggie .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAGGIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes 'm .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She leaves the room with the tray .</stage>
    <stage>JINNY replaces the small table carelessly , almost roughly .</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN opens and reads the telegram ; there is a second 's pause .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>May I read it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>After a moment 's hesitation .</stage>Yes , if you wish .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Not handing it to her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>I do !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Reaches over and hands her the telegram ; he speaks quietly .</stage>When you behave like this it 's impossible for me to feel the same toward you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>And how do you think I feel when I read this ?</l>
<stage>Reads it , satirically , bitterly .</stage>      <l>“ Arrived safely ; please let me see you before the day goes . Ruth . ”</l>
      <l>“ Ruth ” if you please !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Standing over JINNY .</stage>I want you to be careful to-night . I want you to control yourself . I 've been through a great deal to-day , and if you make me angry God knows what I might n't say and do !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>And I 've been through a great deal for many a day now , and I want the truth about this at last ! It 's all very well for you to spare her by not telling me what this mysterious trouble is about which you 've been hoodwinking me ever since we were married , but now you 've got to choose between sparing her and sparing me !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She sits determinedly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Is this your answer to me when I beg you to be very careful to-night to control yourself ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>It 's your turn to be careful ! What did you marry me for if you were in love with Ruth ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Jinny !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>A little frightened , to excuse herself .</stage>You gave me your word of honor she would stay abroad indefinitely .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Nonsense ! I said I understood she was going to stay some time — indefinitely .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>It 's the same thing , and here she is back practically the moment we are !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>I can n't control Miss Chester 's movements — I could n't foresee when she would come back . In Rome she told me she would stay on .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rising and facing him .</stage>Ah ! that 's what I wanted to see , if you really would lie to me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>What do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Beside herself .</stage>Liar !<stage>He only looks at her , with his face hard and set ; she is insane with jealousy for the moment .</stage>You sent for Ruth to come back .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>And if I did ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>You tried to deceive me about it . And if you 'll tell me a lie about one thing , you 'll tell me a lie about another , and I do n't believe one word of all your explanations about the intrigue between you and Ruth Chester !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taking her two hands .</stage>Sit down !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She sits in the arm-chair , half forced by him .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Why did you send for Ruth Chester to come back ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>I have told you before , I am trying to help Miss Chester .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>“ Ruth ! ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>I am trying to help her in a great and serious trouble .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Why did you send for her to come back ? What 's the trouble ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>I 've told you before I can n't tell you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>You dare n't tell me , and you have n't even the face to tell another lie about it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>If you say another word , I shall hate you ! If you wo n't control yourself , I must make you , as well as keep my own sane balance . You have insulted my love for you to-night as you 've never done before ; you 've struck at my own ideal of you ; you 've almost done , in a word , what I warned you you might do — kill the love I have for you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Frightened .</stage>Jack !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>I mean what I say !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>In tears .</stage>That — that you — you do n't love me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>That is not what I said , but I tell you now that since I first began to care for you , never have I loved you so little as I do to-night .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>With an effort at angry justification .</stage>And suppose I tell you it is your own fault , because you have n't treated me —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Interrupting her .</stage>Like a child , instead of a woman !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>No , because you 've kept part of yourself from me , and that part you 've given —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>For God 's sake , stop !<stage>A pause — JINNY is now thoroughly frightened ; slowly she comes to her senses .</stage>Do you want a rupture for good between us ?<stage>No answer .</stage>Ca n't you see what I tell you is true ? That I can n't bear any more to-night ? That if you keep on you will rob me of every bit of love I have for you , just as you 've already robbed me of the woman I thought you were ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>“ Already ! ” No , no , Jack , do n't say that . Oh , what have I done !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She cries .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>You 've done something very serious , and before you do more —<stage>Speaking hardly .</stage>— I think we 'd better not stay in this evening ; it would be wiser for both of us if we went out somewhere .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>No , I could n't go out feeling this way ! I 've hurt you , hurt you terribly ! Oh , why do I do it ? Why can n't I help myself ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>I think one more scene to-night would finish things for us . I warn you of that , Jinny —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes to the desk and sits at it , looking blankly before him . She comes slowly , almost timidly , behind his chair .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>No , do n't say it ! do n't say it ! Try to forgive me — oh , Jack , I hate myself , and I 'm so ashamed of myself ! I know I 've disappointed you awfully , awfully ! You did idealize me ; I knew it when you married me , but I told you then I was n't worth your loving me , did n't I ? I never pretended to be worthy of you . I always knew I was n't .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Hush !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>It 's true ! it 's only too awfully true . But do you remember how you answered me then when I told you I was n't worth your loving me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coldly and without looking at her .</stage>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>You took me in your arms and held me so I could n't have got away if I 'd wanted to — which I did n't — and stopped the words on my lips with your kisses .<stage>Her throat fills . He makes no reply . She goes on very pathetically .</stage>How I wish you 'd answer me that way now !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Whose fault is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , mine ! mine ! I know it . You do n't know it one-half so well as I ! I love you better than anything in the world , love everything of you — the turn of your head , the blessed touch of your hand , the smallest word that comes from your dear lips — the thoughts that your forehead hides , but which my heart guesses when I 'm sane ! And yet , try as hard as I can , these mad fits take hold of me , and although I 'd willingly die to save you pain , still I , I myself , hurt and wound you past all bearing ! It does n't make any difference that I suffer too ! I ought to ! I deserve to — you do n't ! Oh , no ! I know I 'm a disappointment and a failure !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Her eyes fill up with tears and her voice breaks .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>He turns to her .</stage>No , Jinny , not so bad as that , only I thought you were big — and you 're so little , oh , so small !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Yes , it 's true ; I 'm small — I 'm small ! Oh , I 'd like to be big , too ! I want to be noble and strong , but I 'm not — I 'm as weak as water — only it 's boiling water ! I want to be Brunhilde , and I 'm only Frou Frou ! Yes , I 'm little ; but I love you — I love you !<stage>She sinks on to a stool beside him . A moment 's pause .</stage><stage>With a trembling voice .</stage>You do n't mind my sitting here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>No —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Very quietly , he places his arm about her neck , his hand on her shoulder . She quickly steals up her hand to take his , and leaning her head over it , kisses his hand . He draws it away and kisses her hair .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Timidly , very softly .</stage>You forgive me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a long sigh .</stage>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Bursting into tears and burying her face upon his knees .</stage>Thank you — thank you — I know I do n't deserve it — I do n't deserve it — I do n't deserve it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Softly .</stage>Sh !—</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>JINNY half turns and looks up at him .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Very , very quietly .</stage>You forgive me — but still — yes , I see it in your face , you do n't love me the same . You look so tired , dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Also very quietly .</stage>I am , Jinny .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>And — happy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>I 'm not quite happy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>I wish I could make you so — make you love me the old way . You used to smile a little when you looked at me — Jack , you do n't any more . But I mean to make you to-night , if I can , and to make you love me as much as ever you did .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Good luck , dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Brightening .</stage>What time is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking at his watch .</stage>Nearly nine .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>I suppose it is too late for me to dress and for us to go to the theatre ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>Oh , yes ,— and I 'm too tired .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Triumphantly .</stage>Well , then , you shall have your theatre at home ! If Mahomet wo n't go to the mountain , the mountain must go to your lordship !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p>I do n't understand !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Well , just wait —<stage>She blows her nose .</stage>— till I bathe my face and eyes a little ; I feel rather bleary !<stage>Starting to go , she stops and turns .</stage>Good-by ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Questioningly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quietly .</stage>Good-by .</p>

    <stage>She goes out Left .</stage>
    <stage>She is heard singing in her room . AUSTIN goes to the desk and after a long sigh he begins to write .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Writing .</stage>Dear Ruth . The satisfaction of the visit to Brooklyn prevents me from being disappointed at having missed your telegram till too late to go to your house to-night . My heart aches for the blow you must have this evening , but please God you will bear it bravely . The man who loves you is not bad , but he has been weak . However , I feel once he can shake off the burden of his present marriage , you will never have cause to complain of him again . And if your future happiness lies truly in his hands , it will be safe there .</p>

     <speaker>AUSTIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Continues to write .</stage>So far I have been able to keep Jinny in absolute ignorance , but I fear the blow must fall upon her soon , and I dread to think of what she , too , will suffer . Help me to keep it from her as long as we can , wo n't you ?</p>

    <stage>JINNY comes back ; she has changed her dress to a loose negligée gown , with a red turban on her head ; she brings two sheets with her .</stage>

     <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
     <p>Excuse me one minute while I set the stage !<stage>Moving toward each other the big arm-chair and the sofa , she covers them with the sheets . AUSTIN turns from his letter on the desk , to watch .</stage>Uncle Tom 's Cabin ,</p>

    <head type="act">Act Four ! [ She goes out only for a moment , and reënters , wearing a</head>
    <stage>man 's overcoat , with a pillow tied in the middle with a silk scarf , eyes , nose , and mouth made on it with a burnt match . ] Eliza crossing the ice ! Come , honey darling ! [ To the pillow . ] Mammy 'll save you from de wicked white man ! [ Jumping up on the sofa , and moving with the springs . ] You ought to do the bloodhounds for me , Jack ! Excuse me , but you look the part ! [ AUSTIN watches her , not unamused , but without smiling . ] Hold tight to Lize , honey , and do n't be afeerd o ’ dat big black man over dah — dat 's Uncle Tom . [ Crossing to the arm-chair . ] Do n't be afeerd , honey ; it 's Lize dat 's cuttin ’ de ice this time . [ She throws the pillow away and drags off the two sheets . ] Oh , I can see this is too serious for you !</stage>
    <stage>[ She starts singing a cakewalk and dances across the room until she reaches him , where she finishes .</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . Very good , Jinny ! I 'm sure we could n't have seen better at the theatre .</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . Ah ! You 're getting yourself again !— Darling ! Come !— Come !— come to the pianola and you shall have the sextette ! It 's in there ready ; I heard mother struggling with it . You do n't suppose she has designs upon the Casino , do you ? Now — ready ?</stage>
    <stage>[ He goes to the pianola and starts to play the sextette from “ Florodora . ” She runs to the opposite side of the room and begins to sing and dance , crossing to AUSTIN as he plays .</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . [ After a few moments . ] But I can n't see you and play at the same time ; I do n't like it !</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . [ Delighted . ] You want to see me , do you ?</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . Of course I do !</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . Jack ! [ Delighted . ] Well , then , turn round !</stage>
    <stage>[ JINNY , hurrying the time of the song , turns it into a regular skirt dance . She dances delightfully and AUSTIN cannot resist her charm . His face lightens , he smiles , and love comes into his eyes . JINNY sees and dances and sings all the better till she reaches him .</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . [ Rising , he takes her into his arms . ] You adorable Jinny !</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . Ah , Jack ! You 're smiling again and — you love me !</stage>
    <stage>[ Clasping her arms about his neck .</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . Yes ! Is the theatre finished ?</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . No , only the first act . [ He sits in the big arm-chair , JINNY on his knee . ] I 'm tired ! [ He kisses her . There is a pause . There is a knock on the door at Right . ] Oh , hang it ! [ Knock repeated . ] Do n't answer it ! We have n't half made up yet !</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . But we must answer it , dear .</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . [ As she rises unwillingly . ] I do n't see why — I should have let her knock till she went away .</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . Come in !</stage>
    <stage>[ MAGGIE enters with a letter .</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . What is it , Maggie ?</stage>
    <stage>MAGGIE . A note from Miss Chester , m 'm , and she 's downstairs herself waiting for an answer .</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . For me ?</stage>
    <stage>[ Taking the letter .</stage>
    <stage>MAGGIE . No , m 'm ; I think she said it was for Mr. Austin .</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . Oh !— You may wait outside for the answer , Maggie .</stage>
    <stage>MAGGIE . Yes , m 'm .</stage>
    <stage>[ She goes out .</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . [ Slowly goes to AUSTIN and gives him the letter , lightly . ] I see now why you were so anxious to let Maggie in . Perhaps you were expecting this .</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . Jinny ! [ Holding her by the hand and trying to pull her over to him . ] Come , I 'll give you a kiss for the letter .</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . No , thank you , I do n't want kisses that are given by you for letters from Ruth Chester . Yes ! do kiss me ! [ He kisses her . ] I wo n't be jealous ! I wo n't be ! [ Clinching her teeth . ] See , I 'm not jealous a bit ! Read your old letter !</stage>
    <stage>[ AUSTIN opens the note and reads it . As he does so JINNY has passed on to the desk and sees AUSTIN 'S unfinished letter to RUTH , which after a little hesitation she picks up and reads . AUSTIN , having read RUTH 'S note , looks up thoughtfully a second , and then re-reads it . JINNY is furious over what she reads . As she finishes she gives a little cry from the very depths of her heart .</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . Oh , Jack !</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . What is it ?</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . Nothing !</stage>
    <stage>[ She sinks by the desk , crushing the letter in her hand . She looks over at him , and then down at the letter , and then back at him .</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . Maggie !</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . [ Rising suddenly . She speaks with a voice trembling with only half-contained emotion and passion . ] I told her to wait in the hall ; may I read it ?</stage>
    <stage>[ Holding out her hand for the letter .</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . Now look here , Jinny ,— I always let you read everything , do n't I ?</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . [ Hiding his letter behind her back . ] Yes . [ Holding out her other hand . ] Give it to me !</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . Now begin to show that you really are going to turn over a new leaf , and that your love is going to have perfect confidence , and do n't ask to see this letter .</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . But I do ask to see it !</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . Then this time I must refuse you !</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . What ! is it even more compromising than your letter to her ?</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . What letter ? [ Looking first on the desk , he looks across at her and sees it in her hand . He is angry , but also frightened for fear it has told her her brother 's secret . ] And you 've read it ?</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . It lay open on the desk there , and anyway the end justifies me !</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . [ In an agony . ] What does it tell you ? I forget what I wrote !</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . It tells me that my jealousy all along has been right , that I 've been a fool to let you blind me !</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . [ With a great sigh of relief . ] Is that all ?</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . [ Beside herself . ] “ Is that all ! ” Is n't that enough ? Dear God , is n't that enough ? That there 's an understanding between you and Ruth to get rid of me !</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . If it tells you that , the letter lies ! Give it to me !</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . No ! I 'll read it to you ! [ Reads with bitter emphasis . ] “ The satisfaction of the visit to Brooklyn prevents me from being disappointed at having missed your telegram till too late to go to your house to-night ! ” So — you and she went to Brooklyn , did you , and that 's why you came back too late to go to the theatre with me ? You cheat ! [ She screams in her madness . A pause . ] Why do n't you answer — why do n't you say something ?</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . Because if I speak as I feel , I 'm afraid of saying something I 'll regret all my life !</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . You do n't deny , then ?</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . Yes ! that is due to Ruth . Whatever you may feel about me , you have no right to insult her !</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . Oh , there 's more to the letter !</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . Jinny , do n't you see what you 're doing ?</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . Yes , I 'm getting at the truth at last ! [ Reads . ] “ My heart aches for the blow you must have this evening ! The man who loves you — ”</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . You sha n't read any more ; you 're mad now !</stage>
    <stage>[ Tearing the letter away from her .</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . I do n't need the letter , the words are burning in here ! [ Pressing her hands to her forehead . ] “ The man who loves you is n't bad , only weak . However , I feel once we can shake off the burden of this present marriage ” — oh ! you — you brute to say that !— “ you will never have cause to complain of him again ! So far I have been able to keep Jinny in perfect ignorance , but I feel the blow must fall upon her now — ”</stage>
    <stage>[ Interrupted .</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . Shall I tell you the truth ?</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . You do n't have to ; I 've found it out for myself !</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . [ In weariness , in disgust , in utter hopelessness . ] No ! what 's the use . You 've done it now — let it go ! Let it all go — the whole thing ! What 's the use !— it 's finished !— [ A knock on the door at Right . ] Come in !</stage>
    <stage>[ Maggie enters and closes the door behind her .</stage>
    <stage>MAGGIE . Please , sir , Miss Chester came upstairs and made me knock again to see if there was an answer and if you will see her now or not .</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . [ Suddenly — aflame with her idea . ] Yes ! Maggie , show her in !</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . No , no ! What do you want to do ! I 'll see Miss Chester to-morrow , Maggie .</stage>
    <stage>[ JINNY has crossed to the door , Right .</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . Ruth ! Ruth !</stage>
    <stage>RUTH . [ Off stage . ] Yes ? May I come ?</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . Do come in !</stage>
    <stage>[ She recrosses room ; she and AUSTIN face each other for a second .</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . [ In a lowered voice . ] For God 's sake , be careful !</stage>
    <stage>[ RUTH enters Right .</stage>
    <stage>RUTH . Jinny !</stage>
    <stage>[ Going to her quickly to embrace her .</stage>
    <stage>[ JINNY , without speaking , draws away and stares at her with a look of hatred . RUTH , seeing it , stops short , and looks from JINNY to AUSTIN for explanation — she turns to AUSTIN and gives him her hand , which he takes , presses , and drops ; JINNY 'S shoulders contract at this moment ; RUTH immediately turns again to JINNY .</stage>
    <stage>RUTH . What is it , Jinny ? [ To AUSTIN . ] Surely she does n't blame me in any way .</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . Blame you !</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . She does n't know .</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . That 's a lie ! I know everything , Ruth ! I know why you followed my husband to Rome , and why he sent for you to come back here . I know that you and he were in Brooklyn this afternoon , and that you only plan to get rid of me by some divorce , and by hook or crook to marry each other !</stage>
    <stage>RUTH . No !— No !—</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . Oh , you can lie , too , can you ? I wo n't keep you waiting long ! You 've stolen my husband from me — take him . I wo n't share him with any woman ! He 's yours now , and I 'll soon be out of your way !</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . Jinny !</stage>
    <stage>RUTH . [ To Austin . ] She must be told the truth .</stage>
    <stage>[ AUSTIN bows his head .</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . Now you 'll make up your story , will you ? I tell you it 's useless . If he would n't let me see your compromising letter , I 've seen a letter from him to you to-night that gives the whole thing away .</stage>
    <stage>RUTH . [ Very quietly . ] Your husband went to Brooklyn without me , as your brother will tell you , to see the clergyman who married me , or thought he married me to Geoffrey Tillman three months ago ! [ JINNY looks up with a start . ] That marriage was illegal because your brother was already married , and Mr. Austin tried and did get the promise of silence this afternoon about the Brooklyn service , to prevent a charge of bigamy against your brother . The first marriage , which still holds good , was with — Maggie , your present servant —</stage>
    <stage>[ JINNY stands immovable . There is a silence .</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . Geoffrey is not at your house ?</stage>
    <stage>RUTH . No , he left when I came on here . As I wrote you in the note I sent upstairs , I was too stunned by what he told me to answer then , and I wanted a word of advice with you . [ She turns to JINNY . ] I knew what I thought was my marriage to your brother must be kept secret , but I could not learn why . This was my trouble , which , after your marriage , I selfishly laid on your husband 's shoulders , thinking he might help me ! [ No answer from JINNY , who stands as if struck dumb and into stone . ] Mr. Austin only learned the whole truth when we met that day in Rome . I did not learn till to-day that I was not honestly your brother 's wife . I had to be told , because divorce proceedings are to be started at once to break — the other — marriage . [ No answer from JINNY . ] To spare me , and above all to spare you the knowledge of your brother 's sin , your husband has kept Geoffrey 's secret from you . You have well repaid him ! [ She turns again to AUSTIN . ] Good-by — I feel to-night I could n't marry Geoffrey again . He 's tumbled so far off his pedestal he has fallen out of my heart . But still — we 'll see ; I 've told him to come to-morrow . Thank you from the bottom of my heart — it 's full of gratitude , even if it is broken !</stage>
    <stage>[ She goes out Right .</stage>
    <stage>[ JINNY slowly turns , almost afraid to look at AUSTIN . He stands stern , with set face .</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . [ In a low voice , ashamed to go near him . ] Can you forgive me ? Can you —</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . Ugh !</stage>
    <stage>[ Crossing room for his coat .</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . I 'm mad ! You know I do n't know what I do . But I love you — I love you ! Forgive me !</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . Never !</stage>
    <stage>[ Taking up his coat .</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . Where are you going ?</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . Out of this house .</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . If you leave me , I 'll not bear it ! I 'll kill myself ! I warn you !</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . Bah !— Good-by !</stage>
    <stage>[ Going to the door Right .</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . No ! Where are you going ?</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . Out of this house for good !</stage>
    <stage>[ At the door he turns and looks at her .</stage>
    <stage>JINNY . [ Echoes . ] For good ?</stage>
    <stage>AUSTIN . For good !</stage>
    <stage>[ He goes out , slamming the door behind him .</stage>
    <stage>[ JINNY stands a moment motionless . She then cries faintly — “ Jack ! ” She goes to the door and pushes it open , crying out again in loud , strong despair , “ Jack ! ” There is a moment 's pause . She cries out again weakly , heartbrokenly , “ Jack ! ” — comes back into the room , and throwing herself down on the floor , her head resting on her arms in the arm-chair , she sobs hysterically , wildly , “ What have I done ! Dear God , what have I done ! ” as</stage>

     <stage type="setting">
      <stage>Dawn of the next day . At the rise of the curtain JINNY is by the open window , whose curtains she has thrown aside . The sky is blood-red and streaked with gold the moment before sunrise . JINNY is worn and haggard , with hair dishevelled .</stage>
     </stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JINNY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Turning and leaning against the window .</stage>Day at last ! What a night — what a night — but now it 's morning and he has n't come back ! He means it ! And it 's my own fault — it 's my own fault !<stage>She shivers . She closes the window and comes away . After a moment 's pause she goes deliberately and looks at the several gas fixtures in the room . She then closes all the doors and locks them . She carefully draws down the shade and closes in the curtains of the window . She hesitates , then pulls aside the curtains and the shade , and takes a long , last look at the dawn . She closes it all in again . She gets Austin 's picture from the desk and places it on the table near the centre of the room . She then goes to the gas bracket at the Right and turns on the gas . She lights it to see if the gas is all right ; then blows it out . She then crosses to the other bracket and turns that on ; she goes to the chandelier at centre , and , mounting a chair , turns on its three jets . She then sits down by the table with AUSTIN 'S picture before her , and looking into its eyes , her elbows on the table , her head in her hands , she waits .</stage>Oh , Jack , my beloved ! I could n't help it — I never for one minute stopped loving you better than everything else in my life , but no more than I could stop loving you could I stop or help being jealous ! Once the cruel idea has got hold of me it seems to have to work its way out ! Everything gets red before me and I do n't seem to know what I say or do ! It 's no excuse , I know . I 've got no excuse , only I love you ! You 'll forgive me when I 'm gone , wo n't you , Jack ? You 'll know I loved you !— loved you so I could n't live without you !— loved you !— loved you !<stage>She kisses the photograph tenderly , adoringly , slowly , in tears .</stage>Loved — you — loved you !— loved —<stage>Her head drops forward , as</stage>THE CURTAIN FALLS</p>

      <stage>The same morning , three hours later . The curtain rises on the same scene in a dull , cold , early morning light . The lamp has burnt itself out . A tiny ray of sunlight steals through a slip between the curtains . JINNY sits by the table , her arms spread over it and her head on her arms — she is perfectly still . AUSTIN 'S picture is before her . There is a moment 's silence . Voices are heard outside , approaching door , at Right . Gradually what they say is distinguished .</stage>
