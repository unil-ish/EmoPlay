     <p>Martha By-the-Day An optimistic comedy in 3 acts , by Julie M. Lippmann , author of the “ Martha ” stories . 5 males . 5 females . 3 interiors . Costumes , modern . Plays 2-1 / 2 hours . Full of quaint humor , old-fashioned , homely sentiment , the kind that people who see the play will recall and chuckle over tomorrow and the next day . Miss Lippmann has herself adapted her successful book for the stage and has selected from her novel the most telling incidents , infectious comedy and homely sentiment for the play , and the result is thoroughly delightful . Royalty , $ 25 . Price , 60 cents . Seventeen A comedy of youth , in 4 acts , by Booth Tarkington . 8 males , 6 females . 1 exterior . 2 interiors . Costumes , modern . Plays 2-1 / 2 hours . It is the tragedy of William Sylvanus Baxter that he has ceased to be sixteen and is not yet eighteen . Seventeen is not an age , it is a disease . In his heart William knows all the tortures and delights of love . But he is still sent by his mother on errands of the most humiliating sort and depends on his father for every nickel , the use of which he must justify before he gets it . “ Silly ” Bill fell in love with Lola , the “ Baby-Talk Lady , ” a vapid little flirt . To woo her in a manner worthy of himself ( and of her ) he steals his father 's evening clothes . When his wooings become a nuisance to the neighborhood , his mother steals them back , and has them let out to fit the middle-aged form of her husband , thereby keeping William at home . But when it comes to the “ Baby-Talk Lady 's ” good-bye dance , not to be present was unendurable . Now William again gets the dress suit , and how he wears it at the party , and Genesis discloses the fact that the proud garment is in reality his father 's makes up the story of the play . “ Seventeen ” is a work of exquisite human sympathy and delicious humor . Royalty , $ 25. 00 . Price . 75 cents .</p>

     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p>Well , that is not for me to decide .</p>

     <p><stage>Entering L. C .</stage>Thank you . Would you mind bolting that door again ? He might return .<stage>PRINCESS crosses to door and bolts it .</stage>Do you know what a feud is ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p>Feud ? Spain is the home of feuds .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>So is Kentucky . That 's where I came from . You 're Spanish ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>Then you 'll understand — those shots you heard , that was the end of a feud . I was called home suddenly by the death of my father — shot in the back — feud — man after man — two families — the Marcums and my own had shot each other down . Then my Dad fell and I was left to fight it out alone .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p>Could n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>Could n't I ? God only knows what I 've been through since . Those two shots you heard — that was the finish . This morning when I got back to my hotel , there was a message waiting for me . It was signed Jim Marcum , head of the family , and proposed that , as we were out of Kentucky , we meet and end the feud amicably . He asked me to meet him at this hotel in his room — no matter what hour — he would be waiting . He was leaving at six in the morning and wanted it settled . It was a pretty scheme . I knew the man and I saw the trap . I came over here prepared and went directly to his room . It was on this floor . I flung open the door and met Jim Marcum face to face . He was waiting . Without a word he fired . I fired , and he dropped . Now do you understand why the law would not give me justice ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p>Did you kill him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know — I did n't wait .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p>What are you going to do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know . Do you know what it means to fight single-handed against fearful odds — to fight an endless fight alone ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p>Yes — yes — I know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>Endless fight — without even a single word of encouragement ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I know what it means .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>You know ? How could you know ? How could any woman know ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I do know , because I too am fighting against fearful odds .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>There is no man to fight for you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p>No man left who dares .</p>

     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>Alone .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p>If you 're caught it means your life .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p>Suppose I decide to help you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>What do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p>You have no fear of death ? You are not afraid of ghosts ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>No , I 'm not afraid of ghosts .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p>If you escape from here it will be because I helped you — we might say I saved your life , if what you tell me is true — and if I do it , it will be from a selfish motive entirely — it will be because I have work for you . Do you understand ? Work — hard work — dangerous work . It may mean your life in the end .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>You are frank , anyway .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p>It 's a chance — and you have nothing to lose .</p>

     <p>And if I agree ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p>You will begin by taking the ancient feudal oath of my country .</p>

     <p>Oh , I did n't mean it that way . I mean that you 're different from the popular idea of a Princess . You have more understanding — more sympathy — more heart .</p>

     <p><stage>Very seriously</stage>Call it anything you like , but the castle is haunted , just the same . My grandfather was one of the wealthiest nobles in Spain . When he died my father went to take possession of his estate in Segura .

    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p>Fifteen years ago . Since then two other men have disappeared — just as my father did — and now , the Duke tells me that my brother has entered the castle . You see it runs in the blood . Up to a week ago my brother had sent me a cable every day , then suddenly the messages ceased . All this week not a word . Now I know — my brother has entered the castle , and — well , that is the end .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>Why did you leave Spain ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p>A part of the legend was that a plan had been made showing just where the treasure was located — but this plan could never be found . Only by accident I learned that this plan had been hidden in the back of a locket and the locket , I discovered , had been sold and was in America . It was to find this locket that I left my brother and came here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>Then my work now is to find your brother and solve the mystery ? All right ! We 'll explain to the Duke that you are taking me to Spain for no other purpose than to solve the mystery . In America we 've had trust-breakers and strike-breakers , and now why not Jarvis , the Ghost Breaker ?</p>

      <l>Why , yes , why not ? Carlos would believe almost anything of you</l>
      <l>Americans .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p><stage>Whimsically</stage>And you will tell him you have made me a — er — what is it ? A vassal ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p><stage>Almost shyly</stage>I think not — not just yet .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>By the way , your — er — just how should a perfectly good vassal address his Princess ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hesitatingly</stage>Highness — is correct .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>Highness — tell me , your Highness , a vassal does n't amount to much , does he ? I thought he was a piker .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p><stage>Mystified</stage>A piker — a man who carries a pike ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p><stage>Trying to explain</stage>No , no — a piker is a tin horn .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p>Tin horn ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>Well , a sort of pawn in this game of chess — along with your kings and queens and castles and things .<stage>Seriously , yet playfully</stage>Could a good , hard-working , reliable vassal work his way up to be a Duke or a Lord , or something like that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p><stage>Almost playing with him</stage>You 're an ambitious vassal , are n't you ? I 'm afraid you would n't be content with being anything less than a king .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p><stage>Meaningly</stage>A king — a prince — or a bandit .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p>A bandit ? And why a bandit ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>A king might command — a prince request — a bandit seize .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p>Seize what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p><stage>Daringly</stage>That which a mere vassal can only admire .<stage>Knock at door . Both brought back to earth .</stage></p>

     <p><stage>Patronizingly</stage>I am honored . Interesting task you have undertaken . May I ask if that is your regular profession ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>That is my business , solving mysteries , looking up the family skeleton , hunting out spooks . What we call in America a Ghost Breaker !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
     <p>Ghost Breaker ? A strange calling . I indeed never heard of anything more extraordinary .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>It is not surprising , your Excellency . We are living in an age of specialists — and like every other profession , this calls for its own peculiar training .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p><stage>Interrupting</stage>I am so glad you are here , cousin — you will be able to tell Mr. Warren , so much better than I , all the circumstances .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
     <p>I 'll be delighted to throw any light I can on the mystery , but first tell me —<stage>To PRINCESS</stage>— why did you leave your brother to come to America ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

    </sp>

     <p><stage>Seated on trunk — to DUKE</stage>A wise precaution .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
     <p>You were very fortunate to find it so soon .<stage>Cross R .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p>I knew where to go to find it — and yet I was nearly too late . Think of it , after that dear old locket had lain in an antique shop for ten years , suddenly in one day there came two inquiries for it .<stage>JARVIS sits looking at CARLOS .</stage>Mine was the second . A distinguished-looking gentleman had been there in the morning , described it roughly to the old man and got him to hunt for it . He had just found it when I came in . I doubled the distinguished-looking gentleman 's offer and got it .<stage>Another look at DUKE .</stage>Who do you suppose wanted that locket , Carlos ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
     <p><stage>R ., being cornered and with effort to throw it off lightly</stage>I see that it has already occurred to you that I am the distinguished-looking gentleman whose offer you doubled .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>With curiosity</stage>
      <l>But how did you learn about the memorandum ,</l>
      <l>Carlos ?</l>
      <stage>JARVIS sits on trunk .</stage>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
     <p>I did n't , Cousin . I had not the slightest suspicion that the locket contained the supposed secret . I was merely following my pet hobby , trying to recover some of those precious heirlooms which have been scattered to the four winds .<stage>Quickly</stage>You would be surprised , Mr. Warren , to see the collection I have already rescued and which some day may be yours , Maria .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p><stage>Breaking in impatiently</stage>Well , so much for the treasure . Now let 's hear about the ghost . What 's your opinion of this , your Excellency ? Do you put any stock in ghosts ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , Mr. Warren , I am convinced there are such things .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>You believe that this castle is haunted ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
     <p>I know it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>You think this ghost is dangerous to encounter — that it is the cause of the deaths and disappearances in the castle ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
     <p>I do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>Well , what do you think about that ? Ghosts —— That 's a pretty broad term , your Excellency . Can you tell me just what you believe this ghost is ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
     <p>There are certain occult forces in this world , Mr. Warren , that science cannot fathom , and some of them are manifested in that castle now . A priest might call it a demon or a fiend ; a psychologist , perhaps a returning spirit . I can n't say — but I know there is something real , a malignant force which lurks in that castle , and while it haunts those halls , it is madness for any man to expose himself there .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>Have you ever seen this ghost ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p>My brother has .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>What ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p>Twice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>Good night !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p>So has my father , and the others when they disappeared . No one has seen it three times and lived .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p><stage>Interrupting and looking at DUKE</stage>In just what way do you connect this spook with the treasure ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
     <p>Spook ? I see no connection . What do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>Oh , there is always money where the ghost walks .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know what your experience has been , Mr. Warren . You are evidently a brave man — but you have yet to encounter a real ghost .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>Brave ! It takes no bravery to fight a coward . That is what this ghost is — it 's a coward like every other ghost . I tell you that men are not half so afraid of spirits as spirits are afraid of men . Face the supernatural — and it is beaten to a frazzle before the fight begins . Spooks — horse-thieves — and peevish wild-cats can all be tamed by the same little charm .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p><stage>Mystified</stage>Charm ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Leaning forward</stage>What is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>I 'd hate to tell you . It 's part of my system .<stage>Taking out pistol .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Scornfully</stage>I had been hoping , Mr. Warren , that you had some subtle method of handling this problem , but you evidently propose to meet the forces of the supernatural with firearms . I — I may tell you that this specter has been shot at before without the slightest effect .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling</stage>Quite likely , your Excellency . I have seen rifle fire that had not the slightest effect on a wild-cat for the very reason that the firing was wilder than the cat .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
     <p><stage>As though pitying him</stage>I am sorry for you Mr. Warren . You will find the ghost more real than the treasure .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rising</stage>But the treasure is real , Carlos . Would I have crossed the ocean for this locket unless I knew ? Why , with this paper anybody — a total stranger — could walk right up to the very stone that hides it ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p><stage>Meaningly</stage>Pretty dangerous paper to have around . Look out somebody does not get there ahead of you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Meaningly to JARVIS</stage>Yes , it is a dangerous paper — if it leads anyone into the castle .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laughingly</stage>Well , your Excellency , I 'd go a long way for the fun of unravelling a good mystery with a little spice of danger thrown in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
     <p>You need n't have gone so far , Mr. Warren . You are leaving a very unusual case behind you in New York . The papers are full of it . Have you read them ?<stage>Picking up newspaper .</stage>It will interest you too , Cousin . You were at the Manhattan last night , I believe .</p>

Enter VARDOS , old follower of PRINCE BASILLIO , C. L ., carrying basket , covered by lid or napkin . Seeing DOLORES . Spaniard on steps . Lights full up , amber and white . Blue lights behind in windows , R. and L .</stage>

     <p><stage>Turning to VARDOS</stage>Yes , Vardos . Have you any news ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VARDOS</speaker>
     <p>Nothing . Here 's the basket of food untouched as usual . This is the fifteenth night .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOLORES</speaker>
     <p>Once tonight I thought I saw a light in the tower , Vardos .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VARDOS</speaker>
     <p>If you did , Senorita , it was an unblessed flame .</p>

     <p>You have n't given up hope , have you , Vardos ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VARDOS</speaker>
     <p>I gave up hope when the Prince went into the castle . Tonight I waited till an hour past sundown , and twice I called . Once a wail came back to me . It sounded like a sigh of the damned . When I called the second time , something moved in the turret of the keep , like a man waving ; and my heart leaped for joy . Then , with a harsh cry , a black , ugly bird flew from the turret straight toward where the sun had set — on my left , mind you , the sinister side , the left , the left !<stage>Castanets heard off stage , left .</stage></p>

     <speaker>VARDOS</speaker>
     <p>What can she do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>She would go straight to the castle , and will Segura have it said that they let her go alone as they did the Prince ?</p>

Perhaps your Prince has just crawled to that tower window where he can see our lights . Perhaps he has burned something , a scrap of paper , in the hope that some of you gentlemen would notice it and come to his assistance , but he does n't know what cowards you are or he would n't have wasted his matches .

     <p>Don Robledo — sounds dangerous , but does n't mean much to me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOLORES</speaker>
     <p>It may mean much before you reach the castle . Let me tell you something . Quick , your hand , Senor ! No , the other one .<stage>Grasps his hand .</stage>I 'll pretend to read your palm . Every one of those breaks in your life-line means a moment when you stood face to face with death , and yet , see those little squares of protection around each break ! Senor American , there is one break which you have not yet reached , and the protecting square is not perfect like the others .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>I reckon that square will take care of itself when the time comes .</p>

     <p>So — and are the senorita 's eyes so sharp that she can tell the day and the hour ?</p>

     <speaker>DOLORES</speaker>
     <p>Not my eyes , Senor American , but my ears .<stage>DUKE comes downstairs .</stage>In all my experience I have seen but one hand like yours — it speaks of danger , and that hand belongs to Don Robledo .</p>

     <p>I like to , on this occasion , for I hope it means someone I very much want to meet .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Warren , I feel a certain responsibility for Her Highness ’ actions , and the prospect of your death tonight is most uncomfortable .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>You think I wo n't come back ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
     <p>I think if you go to that castle tonight you take your life in your hands .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>I 've got a pretty good grip .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
     <p>Look here . You Americans are shrewd traders . You get dollar for dollar when you bargain . You are not giving away your life for nothing . Now , what was the price ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>Oh , not very much . The deal was made on bargain day . My life happened to be a little below par .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
     <p>Very well , I will release you from your end of the bargain .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>Your Excellency , I am overwhelmed , but the price is paid and we 're on the job , are n't we , Rusty ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUSTY</speaker>
     <p>Yas , sir , we most certainly is !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
     <p>I suppose that means that you will keep faith with Her Highness ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

      <l>I never saw a man quite so anxious to be killed ; but there it is :</l>

    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p><stage>Crossing to DUKE</stage>Your Excellency , I decline your offer and your advice and your sympathy , and I 'll tell you why . I once saw a gambler lay down four aces . Just think of it : four fat aces . He looked the dealer straight in the eye and said : “ The play ai n't natural . ” Now , you tried to have me arrested on the steamer , you have tried to block me in every move I have made . Now , all of a sudden you express the utmost anxiety as to what 's going to happen to me in the castle . You even offer to buy me off . You advise me to stay out . Shall I take your advice ? No . “ The play ai n't natural . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DUKE</speaker>
     <p>You have intruded into a matter which you neither understand nor appreciate . If , as you say , the play seems unnatural , throw the cards and stay out of the game .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>No , I 'll stay right in the game , but I am going to watch the dealer . Well , come along , Rusty .<stage>Cross to RUSTY .</stage>Let 's see if we can find the landlord .<stage>Picking up bags .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUSTY</speaker>
     <p>I 'd like to find a piece of chicken .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>Chicken , Rusty ? What put that in your head ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUSTY</speaker>
     <p>I 's powerful hungry , Marse Warren .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JARVIS</speaker>
     <p>What — again ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RUSTY</speaker>
     <p>No , sir — it 's the same old hunger .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>I am not — because the Duke or some of his men are probably waiting for me at the top of the stairs with a big long gun , and I 'm no book hero .</p>

     <stage>One of the “ five million ” , Clarence served where he was sent — though it was no further than Texas . As an entomologist he found — on this side of the ocean — no field for his specialty , so they set him to driving mules .</stage>
     <stage>Now , reduced to civil life and seeking a job , he finds a position in the home of one Wheeler , a wealthy man with a family . And because he 'd “ been in the army ” he becomes guide , philosopher and friend to the members of that distracted family group . Clarence 's position is an anomolous one . He mends the plumbing , tunes the piano , types — off stage — and plays the saxophone . And around him revolves such a group of characters as only Booth Tarkington could offer . It is a real American comedy , at which the audience ripples with appreciative and delighted laughter .</stage>
     <stage>Those marvelous young people , Cora and Bobby , are portrait sketches warranted to appeal to everyone .</stage>

     <p>25 West 45th Street , New York City New and Explicit Descriptive Catalogue Mailed Free on Request The Famous Mrs. Fair A play in 4 acts . By James Forbes , author of “ The Commuters ” , “ The Traveling Salesman ” , etc . 3 males , 10 females . 2 interiors . Costumes modern . Plays 2-1 / 2 hours .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Mrs. Fair was a major abroad and won a medal for bravery . Her husband was displeased when Mrs. Fair came home to a fame which lifted her out of his life . The dissatisfaction grew as she became absorbed in public functions . Mr. Forbes traces the widening of the rift between husband and wife with great skill in the first two acts . These are light comedy . In the third the mood becomes serious and we find that Mrs. Fair 's absence from home has set the husband to philandering and the daughter to intimacy with a gay set . Indeed , only through the joint efforts of husband and wife to save the girl from danger , is harmony again established . A true comedy , written with keen insight . Royalty , $ 35. 00 . Price , 75 cents . Nothing But the Truth Comedy in 3 acts . By James Montgomery . 5 males , 6 females . Costumes , modern . 2 interiors . Plays 2-1 / 2 hours . Is it possible to tell the absolute truth — even for twenty-four hours ? It is — at least Bob Bennett , hero or “ Nothing But the Truth ” , accomplished the feat . The bet he made with his business partners , and the trouble he got into is the subject of William Collier 's tremendous comedy hit . “ Nothing But the Truth ” can be whole-heartedly recommended as one of the most sprightly , amusing and popular comedies . Royalty , $ 25. 00 . Price , 60 cents . On the Hiring Line Comedy in 3 acts , by Harvey O'Higgins and Harriet Ford . 5 males , 4 females . 1 interior . Costumes , modern . Plays 2-1 / 4 hours . Sherman Fessenden , unable to induce servants to remain at his Jersey home , hits upon the expedient of engaging detectives as domestics . His second wife , an actress , weary of the country , has succeeded in discouraging every other cook and butler against remaining long , believing that she will convince her husband that country life is dead . So she is deeply disappointed when she finds she cannot discourage the new servants . The sleuths , believing they are called to report on those living with the Fessendens , warn Fessenden that his wife has been receiving love-notes from an actor friend , and that his daughter is planning to elope with a supposed thief . One sleuth causes an uproar making a mess of the situations he has witnessed . Fessenden , however , has learned a lesson and is willing to leave the servant problem to his wife . Enjoyed long runs in New York and Chicago . Royalty , $ 25. 00 . Price , 75 cents . SAMUEL FRENCH , 25 West 45th Street , New York City New and Explicit Descriptive Catalogue Mailed Free on Request Daddy Long-Legs A charming comedy in 4 acts , by Jean Webster . 6 males , 7 females , and 6 orphans , but by easy doubling of some characters , may be played by 4 males , 4 females and 3 orphans . The orphans appear only in the first act and may be played by small girls . 4 easy interiors . Costumes modern . Plays 2-1 / 2 hours . The New York Times wrote the following : “ If you will take your pencil and write down , one below the other , the words delightful , charming , sweet , beautiful and entertaining , and then draw a line and add them up , the answer will be ‘ Daddy Long-Legs ’ . To that result you might even add brilliant , pathetic and humorous , but the answer even then would be just what it was before — the play which Miss Jean Webster has made from her book , ‘ Daddy Long-Legs ’ . To attempt to describe the simplicity and beauty of ‘ Daddy Long-Legs ’ would be like attempting to describe the first breath of Spring after an exceedingly tiresome and hard Winter . ” Enjoyed a two-years ’ run in New York and was then toured for over three years . Royalty , $ 25. 00 . Price , 75 cents . To the Ladies A hilarious comedy in 3 acts , by George S. Kaufman and Marc Connelly . 11 males , 3 females . 3 interiors . Costumes , modern . Plays 2-1 / 2 hours . The authors of “ Dulcy ” have divulged a secret known to every woman — and to some men , though the men do n't admit it . The central figures are young Leonard Beebe and his wife Elsie , a little girl from Mobile . Leonard is the average young American clerk , the kind who read all the “ Success ” stories in the magazines and believe them . Elsie has determined to make him something more . She has her hands full — even has to make an after dinner speech for him — but she does it and the play shows how . Helen Hayes played Elsie and Otto Kruger impersonated Leonard in New York , where it ran a whole season . Here 's a clean and wholesome play , deliciously funny and altogether a diverting evening 's entertainment . Royalty , $ 25. 00 . Price , 75 cents . Three Live Ghosts Comedy in 3 acts by Frederick Isham and Max Marcin . 6 males , 4 females ( 2 policemen ) . 1 interior throughout . Costumes , modern .
