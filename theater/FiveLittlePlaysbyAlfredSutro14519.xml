      <head>THE MAN IN THE STALLS</head>
      <stage>The sitting-room of a little flat in Shaftesbury Avenue . At back is a door leading to the dining-room — it is open , and the dinner-table is in full view of the audience . To the extreme right is another door , leading to the hall .</stage>
      <stage>The place is pleasantly and prettily , though quite inexpensively , furnished . To the left , at angles with the distempered wall , is a baby-grand piano ; the fireplace , in which a fire is burning merrily , is on the same side , full centre . To the right of the door leading to the dining-room is a small side-table , on which there is a tray with decanter and glasses ; in front of this , a card-table , open , with two packs of cards on it , and chairs on each side . Another table , a round one , is in the centre of the room — to right and to left of it are comfortable armchairs . Against the right wall is a long sofa ; above it hang a few good , water-colours and engravings ; on the piano and the table there are flowers . A general appearance of refinement and comfort pervades the room ; no luxury , but evidence everywhere of good taste , and the countless feminine touches that make a room homelike and pleasant .</stage>
      <stage>When the curtain rises , HECTOR ALLEN , a youngish man of forty , with an attractive intellectual face , is seen standing by the dining-table in the inner room , draining his liqueur-glass , with WALTER COZENS to the right of him , lighting a cigarette . WALTER is a few years younger than his friend , moderately good-looking , with fine , curly brown hair and a splendid silky moustache . His morning-clothes are conspicuously well-cut — he is evidently something of a dandy ; HECTOR wears a rather shabby dress-suit , his boots are awkward , and his tie ready-made . BETTY , a handsome woman of thirty , wearing a very pretty tea-gown , is talking to the maid at the back of the dining-room .</stage>
      <stage>HECTOR puts down his glass and comes into the sitting-room , followed by WALTER . HECTOR is puffing at a short , stumpy little black cigar .</stage>
      <stage>HECTOR [ Talking as he comes through , continuing the conversation — he walks to the fireplace and stands with his back to it . ] I tell you , if I 'd known what it meant , I 'd never have taken the job ! Sounded so fine , to be reader of plays for the Duke 's Theatre — adviser to the great Mr. Honeyswill ! And then — when the old man said I was to go to all the first nights — why , I just chortled ! “ It 's the first nights that show you the grip of the thing — that teach you most ” — he said . Teach you ! As though there were anything to learn ! Oh my stars ! I tell you , it 's a dog 's life !</stage>
     </stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Sitting to left of the round table .</stage>I 'd change places with you , sonny .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
      <p>You would , eh ? That 's what they all say ! Four new plays this week , my lad — one yesterday , one to-day — another to-morrow , and the night after ! All day long I 'm reading plays — and I spend my nights seeing ‘ em ! D'you know I read about two thousand a year ? Divide two thousand by three hundred and sixty five . A dog 's life — that 's what it is !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p>Better than being a stockbroker 's clerk — you believe me !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
      <p>Is it ? I wish you could have a turn at it , my bonny boy ! Your hair 'd go grey , like mine ! And look here — what are the plays to-day ? They 're either so chock-full of intellect that they send you to sleep — or they reek of sentiment till you yearn for the smell of a cabbage !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p>Well , you 've the change , at any rate .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
      <p><stage>Snorting .</stage>Change ? By Jove , give me a Punch and Judy show on the sands — or performing dogs ! Plays — I 'm sick of ‘ em ! And look here — the one I 'm off to to-night . It 's adapted from the French — well , we know what that means . Husband , wife and mistress . Or wife , husband , lover . That 's what a French play means . And you make it English , and pass the Censor , by putting the lady in a mackintosh , and dumping in a curate !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Coming in , and closing the door leading to the dining-room .</stage>You ought to be going , Hector .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>She , stands listening for a moment , then goes through the other door into the hall .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
      <p><stage>Disregarding her , too intent on his theme .</stage>And I tell you , of the two , I prefer the home-made stodge . I 'm sick of the eternal triangle . They always do the same thing . Husband strikes attitudes — sometimes he strikes the lover . The lover never stands up to him — why should n't he ? He would — in real life .<stage>BETTY comes back , with his overcoat and muffler — she proceeds affectionately to wrap this round his neck , and helps him on with his coat , he talking all the time .</stage>He 'd say , look here , you go to Hell . That 's what he 'd say — well , there you 'd have a situation . But not one of the playwriting chaps dares do it . Why not , I ask you ? There you 'd have truth , something big . But no — they 're afraid — think the public wo n't like it . The husband 's got to down the lover — like a big tom-cat with a mouse — or the author 'd have to sell one of his motor-cars ! That 's just the fact of it !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <lg>
       <stage>Looking at the clock on the mantelpiece .</stage>
       <l>Twenty-five past ,</l>
       <l>Hector .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
      <p><stage>Cheerily .</stage>All right , my lass , I 'm off . By-bye , Walter — keep the old woman company for a bit . Good-bye , sweetheart .<stage>He kisses her .</stage>Do n't wait up . Now for the drama . Oh , the dog 's life !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He goes . BETTY waits till the hall door has banged , then she sits on the elbow of WALTER 'S chair , and rests her head on his shoulder .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Softly .</stage>Poor Hector !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Uncomfortably .</stage>Yes ...</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p>Does n't it make you feel dreadful when he talks like that ?<stage>She kisses him ; then puts her arms round his neck , draws his face to her , and kisses him again , on the cheek .</stage>Does n't it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>She nestles contentedly closer to him .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Trying to edge away .</stage>Well , it does . Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Dreamily .</stage>I — like it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p>Betty !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p>Yes , I like it . I do n't know why . I suppose I 'm frightfully wicked . Or the danger perhaps — I do n't know .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Making a futile effort to get up .</stage>Betty —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Tightening her arms around him .</stage>Stop there , and do n't move . How smooth your chin is — his scrapes . Why do n't husbands shave better ? Or is it that the forbidden chin is always smoother ? Poor old Hector ! If he could see us ! He has n't a suspicion . I think it 's lovely — really , I do . He leaves us here together , night after night , and imagines you 're teaching me bridge .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Restlessly .</stage>So I am . Where are the cards ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Caressing him .</stage>Silly , have you forgotten that this is Tuesday — Maggie 's night out ? She 's gone — I told her she need n't wait to clear away . We 've arranged master 's supper . Master ! You 're my master , are n't you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p>I do n't know what I am ...</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p>Oh yes you do — you 're my boy . Whom I love . There .<stage>She kisses him again , full on the lips .</stage>That was a nice one , was n't it ? Poor old Hector , sitting in his stall — thinks he 's so wonderful , knows such a lot ! Yes , Maggie 's out — with her young man , I suppose . The world 's full of women , with their young men — and husbands sitting in the stalls .... And I suppose that 's how it always has been , and always will be .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Shifting uneasily .</stage>Do n't , Betty — I do n't like it . I mean , he has such confidence in us .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p>Of course he has . And quite rightly . Are n't you his oldest friend ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>With something of a groan .</stage>I 've known him since I was seven .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p>The first man he introduced me to — his best man at the wedding — do you remember coming to see us during the honeymoon ? I liked you then .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Really shocked .</stage>Betty !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p>I did . You had a way of squeezing my hand .... And then when we came back here . You know it did n't take me long to discover —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Protesting .</stage>I scarcely saw you the first two or three years !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p>No — you were afraid . Oh I thought you so silly !<stage>He suddenly contrives to release himself — gets up , and moves to the card-table .</stage>Why , what 's the matter ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>At the table , with his back to her .</stage>I hate hearing you talk like this .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p>Silly boy !<stage>She rises , and goes to him ; he has taken a cigarette out of the box on the table , and stands there , with his head bent , tapping the cigarette against his hand .</stage>Women only talk “ like this , ” as you call it , to their lovers . They talk “ like that ” to their husbands — and that 's why the husbands never know . That 's why the husbands are always sitting in the stalls , looking on .<stage>She puts her arms round him again .</stage>Looking and not seeing .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>She approaches her lips to his — he almost fretfully unclasps her arms .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p>Betty — I want to say a — serious word ...</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Looking fondly at him .</stage>Well , is n't what I 'm saying serious ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p>I 'm thirty-eight .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p>Yes . I 'm only thirty . But I 'm not complaining .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p>Has it ever occurred to you —</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He stops .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p>What ?</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>WALTER looks at her — tries to speak , but cannot — then he breaks away , goes across the room to the fireplace and stands for a moment looking into the fire . She has remained where she was , her eyes following him wonderingly . Suddenly he stamps his foot violently .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p>Damn it ! DAMN it !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Moving towards him in alarm .</stage>What 's the matter ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>With a swift turn towards her .</stage>I 'm going to get married .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Stonily , stopping by the round table .</stage>You ...</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Savagely .</stage>Going to get married , yes . Married , married !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>She stands there and does n't stir — does n't speak or try to speak ; merely stands there , and looks at him , giving no sign . Her silence irritates him ; he becomes more and more violent , as though to give himself courage .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p>You 're wonderful , you women — you really are . Always contrive to make us seem brutes , or cowards ! I 've wanted to tell you this a dozen times — I 've not had the pluck . Well , to-day I must . Must , do you hear that ?... Oh , for Heaven 's sake , say something .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Still staring helplessly at him .</stage>You ...</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Feverishly .</stage>Yes , I , I ! Now it 's out , at least — it 's spoken ! I mean to get married , like other men — fooled , too , I dare say , like the others — at least I deserve it ! But I 'm tired , I tell you — tired —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p>Of me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p>Tired of the life I lead — the beastly , empty rooms — the meals at the Club . And I 'm thirty-eight — it 's now or never .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Slowly .</stage>And how about — me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p>You ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Passionately .</stage>Yes . Me . Me !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p>You did n't think this would last for ever ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Nodding her head .</stage>I did — yes — I did . Why should n't it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Working himself into a fury again .</stage>Why ? You ask that ? Why ? Oh yes , it 's all right for you — you 've your home and your husband — I 'm there as an — annexe . To be telephoned to , when I 'm wanted , at your beck and call , throw over everything , come when you whistle . And it 's not only that — I tell you it makes me feel — horrid . After all , he 's my — friend .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p>He has been that always . You did n't feel — horrid — before .... Who is she ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Shortly , as he turns back to the fire .</stage>That does n't matter .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p>Yes , it does . Who ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Fretfully .</stage>Oh , why should we —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p>I want to know — I 'm entitled to know .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Still with his back to her .</stage>Mary Gillingham .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p>Mary Gillingham !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Firmly , swinging round to her .</stage>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p>That child , that chit of a girl !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p>She 's twenty-three .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p>Whom I introduced you to — my own friend ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Grumbling .</stage>What has that to do with it ? And besides ...<stage>He suddenly changes his tone , noticing how calm she has become — he takes a step towards her , and stands by her side , at the back of the table , his voice becomes gentle and affectionate .</stage>But I say , really , you 're taking it awfully well — pluckily . I knew you would — I knew I was an ass to be so — afraid .... And look here , we 'll always be pals — the very best of pals . I 'll ... never forget — never . You may be quite sure ... of that . I want to get married — I do — have a home of my own , and so forth — but you 'll still be — just the one woman I really have loved — the one woman in my life — to whom I owe — everything .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <lg>
       <stage>With a mirthless laugh .</stage>
       <l>Do you tell all that — to Mary</l>
       <l>Gillingham ?</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>

      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Angrily , facing her .</stage>Become of you ! Do n't talk such nonsense . Because it is — really it is . You 'll be as you were . And Hector 's a splendid chap — and after all we 've been frightfully wrong — treating him infernally badly — despicably . Oh yes , we have — and you know it . Lord , there 've been nights when I have — but never mind that — that 's all over ! In future we can look him in the face without feeling guilty — we can —</p>

      <p>You can , because of this girl . Oh , I know , of course ! You 'll come here three or four times — then you 'll drop off — you 'll feel I 'm not quite the woman you want your wife to know .</p>

      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>With genuine feeling , as he impulsively steps towards her .</stage>Betty , Betty , what sort of cad do you take me for ? What sort of cad , or bounder ? Have n't I told you I 'd never forget — never ? And you think you 'll pass out of my life — that I want you to ? Why , good Heaven , I 'll be your best friend as long as I live . Friend — yes — what I always should have been — meant to be ! And Hector . Why , Betty , I tell you , merely talking to-night , as I 've done , has made me feel — different — sort of — lifted — a load . Because I 've always had it — somewhere deep down in me — when I 've thought of — him .</p>

      <p>That 's what a woman always says , when a man speaks the truth . Because it is the truth — and you know it . “ The way I squeezed your hand ! ” D'you think I meant to squeeze it — in a way ! Why , as there 's a Heaven above me , you were as sacred to me — as my own sister !</p>

      <p>Hector ! Quick , quick — the cards !</p>

Nothing serious . But the play 's postponed for a week . Bit of luck !</p>

      <p><stage>In abject panic .</stage>Hector —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
      <p><stage>Turning fiercely and scowling at her .</stage>If you speak to me I 'll brain you too . Just you go in there and fetch the things . D'you hear ? Go .<stage>She moves into the other room . HECTOR swings round to WALTER .</stage>As for you , you 're a scoundrel . A rogue , a thief , a liar , a traitor . Of the very worst kind , the blackest . Not an ordinary case of a husband and wife — I trusted you — you were my best friend . You spawn , you thing of the gutter , you foul-hearted , damnable slug !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>BETTY comes back , dragging her feet , carrying paper and envelopes and a stylograph — she puts them on the table .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
      <p>Not that stylograph — that 's mine — his dirty hands sha n't touch it — I could never use it again . Fetch your pen — yours — you belong to him , do n't you ? Go in and fetch it . D'you hear ?</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>BETTY goes into the inner room again .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
      <p>My wife . And you the man I 've done more for than for any one else in the world . The man I cared for , you low dog . Used my house — came here because it was dull at the Club — and took my wife ? I do n't know why I do n't kill you . I 've the right . But I wo n't . You shall pay for it , my fine fellow — you are going to pay — now .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>BETTY brings a pen and an inkstand ; she places them on the table ; HECTOR seizes them and pushes them in front of WALTER . BETTY slinks to the other side of the room , and stands by the sofa .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
      <p><stage>To WALTER .</stage>Now you write . You hear ? You write what I dictate . Word for word . What 's the old brute 's name ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p>Whose ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
      <p>Whose ! Her father , the sealing-wax man , old Gillingham ?</p>

      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Staring .</stage>Gillingham ?</p>

      <p>Gillingham . Yes . What is it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p>You want me to write to him ?</p>
     </sp>

      <p><stage>Nodding .</stage>To him . Who else ? A confession ? I 've had that . His name ?</p>

      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Dropping the pen and half rising .</stage>I wo n't —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
      <p><stage>Springing upon him in a mad fury , and forcing him back into the chair .</stage>You wo n't , you dog ! You dare say that — to me ! By Heaven , you will ! You 'll lick the dust off this floor , if I tell you ! You 'll go on your hands and knees , and crawl ! Sit down , you ! Sit down and take up your filthy pen . So .<stage>Thoroughly cowed , WALTER has taken up the pen again .</stage>And now — his name . Do n't make me ask you again , I tell you , do n't . What is it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p>Richard .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
      <p>Very well , Richard . So write that down . To Richard Gillingham . I have to-day proposed to your daughter , and she has accepted me . Got that ? She has accepted me . But I can n't marry her — can n't marry her — because I have seduced the wife of my friend Hector Allen —</p>

      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Appealingly , dropping his pen .</stage>Hector !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
      <p><stage>Frantically gripping WALTER by the throat , till he takes up his pen again .</stage>The wife of my friend Hector Allen — write it — and plainly , you hound , plainly — so — and because I am taking the woman away with me to-night .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p><stage>With a loud cry .</stage>Hector !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
      <p><stage>Over his shoulder , watching WALTER write .</stage>Silence , over there , you ! Hold your tongue ! Go into your room and put on your things — we 've done with you here ! Take what you want — I do n't care — you do n't show your face here again . And you —<stage>he taps his clenched hand against WALTER 'S arm</stage>write . What are you stopping for ? How far have you got ?<stage>He peers over WALTER 'S shoulder .</stage>Because — I — am — taking — the — woman — away — with — me — to-night .</p>

      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Beside herself , wringing her hands .</stage>Hector , Hector —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
      <p><stage>Savagely , as he makes a half-turn towards her .</stage>You still there ? Wait a bit . I 'll come to you , when I 've finished with him . If you have n't gone and put on your things , you shall go off without them . Into the street . You 'll find other women there like you .<stage>He turns back to WALTER .</stage>Here , you , have you written ?<stage>He looks over WALTER 'S shoulder .</stage>Go on — I 'm getting impatient . Go on , I tell you . I — am — taking — the —</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>WALTER is slowly writing down the words , HECTOR standing over him ; BETTY suddenly bursts into a peal of wild , uproarious laughter , and lets herself fall into a chair to the left of the card-table .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
      <p><stage>Madly .</stage>You !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He leaves WALTER , and almost springs at her .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Brimming with merriment .</stage>Oh , you old donkey ! How we have pulled your leg !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
      <p><stage>Staring at her , stopping dead short .</stage>You —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Through her laughter , choking .</stage>Hector , Hector ! Conventional situations ! The usual stodge ! The lover and husband ! You goose , you wonderful old goose !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>WALTER , with a mighty effort , has pulled himself together , and roars with laughter too . He jumps up . HECTOR is standing there blinking , paralysed .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Merrily , to BETTY .</stage>Oh really , you should n't . You 've given it away too soon !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p>Too soon ! He 'd have strangled us . Did you ever see such a tiger ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Chuckling hugely .</stage>He did n't give the lover much chance to stand up to him , did he ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p>And was n't he original ! Dog , hound , villain , traitor !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p>To say nothing of Jezebel ! Though , between ourselves , I think he meant Messalina !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p>And I was to go into the street . But he did let me fill my bag !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p>I think the playwrights come out on top , I do indeed .<stage>He goes to HECTOR , and stands to left of him .</stage>Hector , old chap , here 's the letter !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Going to the other side of HECTOR , and dropping a low curtsey .</stage>And please , Mr . Husband , was it to be a big bag , or a small bag , and might I have taken the silver teapot ?</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>HECTOR has been standing there stupid , dazed , dumbfounded , too bewildered for his mind to act or thoughts to come to him ; he suddenly bursts into a roar of Titanic , overwhelming laughter . He laughs , and laughs , staggers to the sofa , falls on it , rocks and roars till the tears roll down his cheeks . He sways from side to side , unable to control himself — his laughter is so colossal that the infection catches the others ; theirs becomes genuine too .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <lg>
       <stage>With difficulty , trying to control herself .</stage>
       <l>The letter ! Old</l>
       <l>Gillingham ! “ His name , scoundrel , his name ! ”</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Gurgling .</stage>With his hand at my throat ! Sit there , villain , and write !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p>“ I 'll deal with you presently ! Wait till I 've finished with him ! ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p>“ Into the street ! ” At least , they do usually say “ into the night ! ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
      <p><stage>Rubbing his eyes and panting for breath .</stage>Oh , you pair of blackguards ! Too bad — no , really too bad ! It was ! I fell in , I did ! Oh , Lord , oh , Lord , what a nightmare ! But it was n't right , really it was n't — no really ! My Lord , how I floundered — head and shoulders — swallowed it all ! Comes of reading that muck every day — never stopped to think ! I did n't ! Walter , old chap !<stage>He holds out his hand .</stage>Betty ! My poor Betty !<stage>He draws her towards him .</stage>The things I said to you !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Carelessly eluding the caress .</stage>At least admit that you 're rather hard on the playwriting people !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
      <p><stage>Getting up and shaking himself .</stage>Oh , they be blowed ! Well , you have had a game with me !<stage>He shakes himself again .</stage>Brrrrr ! Oh , my Lord ! What I went through !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p>It was a lark ! you should have seen yourself ! Your eyes starting out of your head ! You looked like a murderer !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
      <p>By Jove , and I felt it ! For two pins I 'd have —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p>And Mary Gillingham ! That 's the funniest part ! That you could have thought he was engaged — to her !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Involuntarily the smile dies away on WALTER 'S face ; he turns and stares at her ; she goes on calmly .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p>When she happens to be the one girl in this world he can n't stand !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>With a movement that he can n't control .</stage>Betty !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Turning smilingly to him .</stage>No harm in my telling Hector — he scarcely knows her !<stage>She swings round to HECTOR again .</stage>Why , Walter simply loathes the poor girl ! That 's what made it so funny !<stage>At the mere thought of it she bursts out laughing again , and goes on speaking through her laughter .</stage>And I tell you — if you ever hear he 's engaged to her — why , you can believe the rest of the story too !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
      <p><stage>Laughing heartily as he pats WALTER on the shoulder .</stage>Poor old Walter ! And , d'you know , I was quite pleased at the thought of his getting married ! I was !<stage>He turns to him .</stage>But it 's better , old chap , for us — we 'd have missed you — terribly !<stage>With another pat on WALTER 'S shoulder , he goes to the fire , and drops in the letter .</stage>Must n't leave that lying about !<stage>He turns .</stage>Well , by Jove , if any one had told me .... And drinking to him , and all !</p>

      <lg>
       <l>If you 'll fetch me that glass of Hock now , I will drink to him ,</l>
       <l>Hector . To Walter , the Bachelor !</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
      <p><stage>Beaming .</stage>So we will ! Good . I 'll get it .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He bustles into the dining-room .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Moving swiftly to WALTER .</stage>Well , now 's your time . One thing or the other .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Savagely .</stage>You fiend !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p>I 'll go and see her to-morrow — see her constantly —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p>Why are you doing this ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p>You 've ruined my life and his . At least , you sha n't be happy .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>And you imagine I 'll come back to you — that we 'll go on , you and</l>
       <l>I ?</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Scornfully .</stage>No — do n't be afraid ! You 've shown yourself to me to-day . That 's all done with — finished . His friend now — with the load off you — but never her husband . Never !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>HECTOR comes bustling back , with the bottle of Hock , and a wine-glass that he gives to BETTY — she holds it , and he fills it from the bottle .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
      <p>Here you are , my girl — and now , where 's my whiskey ?<stage>He trots round to the side table , finds his glass , and WALTER 'S — hands one to WALTER .</stage>Here , Wallie — yours must be the one that 's begun — I did n't have time to touch mine ! Here .<stage>WALTER takes it .</stage>And forgive me , old man , for thinking , even one minute —<stage>He wrings him by the hand .</stage>Here 's to you , old friend . And Betty , to you ! Oh , Lord , I just want this drink !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BETTY</speaker>
      <lg>
       <stage>In cold , clear tones , as she holds up her glass .</stage>
       <l>To Walter , the</l>
       <l>Bachelor !</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <stage>She drains her glass ; WALTER has his moment 's hesitation ; he drinks , and with tremendous effort succeeds in composing his face .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
      <p><stage>Gaily .</stage>To Walter , the Bachelor !<stage>He drinks his glass to the dregs and puts it down .</stage>And now — for a game .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WALTER</speaker>
      <p>I think I —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
      <p><stage>Coaxingly .</stage>Sit down , laddie — just one rubber . It 's quite early . Do . There 's a good chap .<stage>They all sit : HECTOR at back , BETTY to the left of him , WALTER to the right — he spreads out the cards — they draw for partners .</stage>As we are — you and Betty — I 've got the dummy .<stage>He shuffles the cards — BETTY cuts — he begins to deal .</stage>That 's how I like it — one on each side of me . Also I like having dummy . Now , Betty , play up . Oh , Lord , how good it is , how good ! A nightmare , I tell you — terrible ! And really you must forgive me for being such an ass . But the way you played up , both of you ! My little Betty — a Duse , that 's what she is — a real Duse !<stage>He gathers up his cards .</stage>And the gods are kind to me — I 've got a hand , I tell you ! I call NO TRUMPS !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He beams at them — they are placidly sorting their cards . He puts his hand down and proceeds to look at his dummy , as the curtain falls .</stage>

     <stage type="setting">
      <head>A MARRIAGE HAS BEEN ARRANGED ....</head>
      <stage>SCENE The conservatory of No . 300 Grosvenor Square . Hour , close on midnight . A ball is in progress , and dreamy waltz music is heard in the distance .</stage>
      <stage>LADY ALINE DE VAUX enters , leaning on the arm of MR. HARRISON CROCKSTEAD .</stage>
      <stage>LADY ALINE is a tall , exquisitely-gowned girl , of the conventional and much-admired type of beauty . Put her in any drawing-room in the world , and she would at once be recognised as a highborn Englishwoman . She has in her , in embryo , all those excellent qualities that go to make a great lady : the icy stare , the haughty movement of the shoulder , the disdainful arch of the lip ; she has also , but only an experienced observer would notice it , something of wistfulness , something that speaks of a sore and wounded heart — though it is sufficiently evident that this organ is kept under admirable control . A girl who has been placed in a position of life where artificiality rules , who has been taught to be artificial and has thoroughly learned her lesson ; yet one who would unhesitatingly know the proper thing to do did a camel bolt with her in the desert , or an eastern potentate invite her to become his two hundred and fifty-seventh wife . In a word , a lady of complete self-possession and magnificent control . MR. CROCKSTEAD is a big , burly man of forty or so , and of the kind to whom the ordinary West End butler would consider himself perfectly justified in declaring that her ladyship was not at home . And yet his evening clothes sit well on him ; and there is a certain air of command about the man that would have made the butler uncomfortable . That functionary would have excused himself by declaring that MR. CROCKSTEAD did n't look a gentleman . And perhaps he does n't . His walk is rather a slouch ; he has a way of keeping his hands in his pockets , and of jerking out his sentences ; a way , above all , of seeming perfectly indifferent to the comfort of the people he happens to be addressing . The impression he gives is one of power , not of refinement ; and the massive face , with its heavy lines , and eyes that are usually veiled , seems to give no clue whatever to the character of the man within .</stage>
      <stage>The couple break apart when they enter the room ; LADY ALINE is the least bit nervous , though she shows no trace of it ; MR. CROCKSTEAD absolutely imperturbable and undisturbed .</stage>
     </stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p><stage>Looking around .</stage>Ah — this is the place — very quiet , retired , romantic — et cetera . Music in the distance — all very appropriate and sentimental .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>She leaves him , and sits , quietly fanning herself ; he stands , looking at her . ] You seem perfectly calm , Lady Aline ?</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Sitting .</stage>Conservatories are not unusual appendages to a ball-room , Mr. Crockstead ; nor is this conservatory unlike other conservatories . CROCKSTEAD<stage>Turning to her .</stage>I wonder why women are always so evasive ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>With your permission we will not discuss the sex . You and I are too old to be cynical , and too young to be appreciative . And besides , it is a rule of mine , whenever I sit out a dance , that my partner shall avoid the subjects of women — and golf .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>You limit the area of conversation . But then , in this particular instance , I take it , we have not come here to talk ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Coldly .</stage>I beg your pardon !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p><stage>Sitting beside her .</stage>Lady Aline , they are dancing a cotillon in there , so we have half an hour before us . We shall not be disturbed , for the Duchess , your aunt , has considerately stationed her aged companion in the corridor , with instructions to ward off intruders .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Very surprised .</stage>Mr. Crockstead !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p><stage>Looking hard at her .</stage>Did n't you know ?<stage>ALINE turns aside , embarrassed .</stage>That 's right — of course you did . Do n't you know why I have brought you here ? That 's right ; of course you do . The Duchess , your aunt , and the Marchioness , your mother — observe how fondly my tongue trips out the titles — smiled sweetly on us as we left the ball-room . There will be a notice in the Morning Post to-morrow : “ A Marriage Has Been Arranged Between — ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Bewildered and offended .</stage>Mr. Crockstead ! This — this is —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p><stage>Always in the same quiet tone .</stage>Because I have not yet proposed , you mean ? Of course I intend to , Lady Aline . Only as I know that you will accept me —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p><stage>In icy tones , as she rises .</stage>Let us go back to the ball-room .</p>

      <p><stage>Quite undisturbed .</stage>Oh , please ! That wo n't help us , you know . Do sit down . I assure you I have never proposed before , so that naturally I am a trifle nervous . Of course I know that we are only supers really , without much of a speaking part ; but the spirit moves me to gag , in the absence of the stage-manager , who is , let us say , the Duchess —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>I have heard of the New Humour , Mr. Crockstead , though I confess I have never understood it . This may be an exquisite example —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>By no means . I am merely trying to do the right thing , though perhaps not the conventional one . Before making you the formal offer of my hand and fortune , which amounts to a little over three millions —</p>

       <stage>Fanning herself .</stage>
       <l>How people exaggerate ! Between six and seven ,</l>
       <l>I heard .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>Only three at present , but we must be patient . Before throwing myself at your feet , metaphorically , I am anxious that you should know something of the man whom you are about to marry .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>That is really most considerate !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>I have the advantage of you , you see , inasmuch as you have many dear friends , who have told me all about you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p><stage>With growing exasperation , but keeping very cool .</stage>Indeed ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>I am aware , for instance , that this is your ninth season —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Snapping her fan .</stage>You are remarkably well-informed .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>I have been told that again to-night , three times , by charming young women who vowed that they loved you . Now , as I have no dearest friends , it is unlikely that you will have heard anything equally definite concerning myself . I propose to enlighten you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Satirically .</stage>The story of your life — how thrilling !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>I trust you may find it so .<stage>He sits , and pauses for a moment , then begins , very quietly .</stage>Lady Aline , I am a self-made man , as the foolish phrase has it — a man whose early years were spent in savage and desolate places , where the devil had much to say ; a man in whom whatever there once had been of natural kindness was very soon kicked out . I was poor , and lonely , for thirty-two years : I have been rich , and lonely , for ten . My millions have been made honestly enough ; but poverty and wretchedness had left their mark on me , and you will find very few men with a good word to say for Harrison Crockstead . I have no polish , or culture , or tastes . Art wearies me , literature sends me to sleep —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>When you come to the chapter of your personal deficiencies , Mr. Crockstead , please remember that they are sufficiently evident for me to have already observed them .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p><stage>Without a trace of annoyance .</stage>That is true . I will pass , then , to more intimate matters . In a little township in Australia — a horrible place where there was gold — I met a woman whom I loved . She was what is technically known as a bad woman . She ran away with another man . I tracked them to Texas , and in a mining camp there I shot the man . I wanted to take the woman back , but she refused . That has been my solitary love affair ; and I shall never love any woman again as I loved her . I think that is all that I have to tell you . And now — will you marry me , Lady Aline ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Very steadily , facing him .</stage>Not if you were the last man in this world , Mr. Crockstead .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p><stage>With a pleasant smile .</stage>At least that is emphatic .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>See , I will give you confidence for confidence . This is , as you suggest , my ninth season . Living in an absurd milieu where marriage with a wealthy man is regarded as the one aim in life , I have , during the past few weeks , done all that lay in my power to wring a proposal from you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>I appreciate your sincerity .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>Perhaps the knowledge that other women were doing the same lent a little zest to the pursuit , which otherwise would have been very dreary ; for I confess that your personality did not — especially appeal to me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p><stage>Cheerfully .</stage>Thank you very much .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>Not at all . Indeed , this room being the Palace of Truth , I will admit that it was only by thinking hard of your three millions that I have been able to conceal the weariness I have felt in your society . And now will you marry me , Mr. Crockstead ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p><stage>Serenely .</stage>I fancy that 's what we 're here for , is n't it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Stamping her foot .</stage>I have , of course , been debarred from the disreputable amours on which you linger so fondly ; but I loved a soldier cousin of mine , and would have run away with him had my mother not packed me off in time . He went to India , and I stayed here ; but he is the only man I have loved or ever shall love . Further , let me tell you I am twenty-eight ; I have always been poor — I hate poverty , and it has soured me no less than you . Dress is the thing in life I care for most , vulgarity my chief abomination . And to be frank , I consider you the most vulgar person I have ever met . Will you still marry me , Mr. Crockstead ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p><stage>With undiminished cheerfulness .</stage>Why not ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>This is an outrage . Am I a horse , do you think , or a ballet-dancer ? Do you imagine I will sell myself to you for your three millions ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>Logic , my dear Lady Aline , is evidently not one of your more special possessions . For , had it not been for my — somewhat eccentric preliminaries — you would have accepted me , would you not ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Embarrassed .</stage>I — I —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>If I had said to you , timidly : “ Lady Aline , I love you : I am a simple , unsophisticated person ; will you marry me ? ” You would have answered , “ Yes , Harrison , I will . ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>It is a mercy to have escaped marrying a man with such a Christian name as Harrison .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>It has been in the family for generations , you know ; but it is a strange thing that I am always called Harrison , and that no one ever adopts the diminutive .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>That does not surprise me : we have no pet name for the East wind .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>The possession of millions , you see , Lady Aline , puts you into eternal quarantine . It is a kind of yellow fever , with the difference that people are perpetually anxious to catch your complaint . But we digress . To return to the question of our marriage —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>I beg your pardon .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>I presume that it is — arranged ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Haughtily .</stage>Mr. Crockstead , let me remind you that frankness has its limits : exceeding these , it is apt to degenerate into impertinence . Be good enough to conduct me to the ball-room .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>She moves to the door .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>You have five sisters , I believe , Lady Aline ?<stage>ALINE stops short .</stage>All younger than yourself , all marriageable , and all unmarried ?</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>ALINE hangs her head and is silent .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>Your father —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Fiercely .</stage>Not a word of my father !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>Your father is a gentleman . The breed is rare , and very fine when you get it . But he is exceedingly poor . People marry for money nowadays ; and your mother will be very unhappy if this marriage of ours falls through .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Moving a step towards him .</stage>Is it to oblige my mother , then , that you desire to marry me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>Well , no . But you see I must marry some one , in mere self-defence ; and honestly , I think you will do at least as well as any one else .<stage>ALINE bursts out laughing .</stage>That strikes you as funny ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>If you had the least grain of chivalrous feeling , you would realise that the man who could speak to a woman as you have spoken to me —</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>She pauses .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>Yes ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>I leave you to finish the sentence .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>Thank you . I will finish it my own way . I will say that when a woman deliberately tries to wring an offer of marriage from a man whom she does not love , she deserves to be spoken to as I have spoken to you , Lady Aline .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Scornfully .</stage>Love ! What has love to do with marriage ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>That remark rings hollow . You have been good enough to tell me of your cousin , whom you did love —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>Well ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>And with whom you would have eloped , had your mother not prevented you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>I most certainly should .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>So you see that at one period of your life you thought differently .— You were very fond of him ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>I have told you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p><stage>Meditatively .</stage>If I had been he , mother or no mother , money or no money , I would have carried you off . I fancy it must be pleasant to be loved by you , Lady Aline .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Dropping a mock curtsey , as she sits on the sofa .</stage>You do me too much honour .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p><stage>Still thoughtful , moving about the room .</stage>Next to being king , it is good to be maker of kings . Where is this cousin now ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>In America . But might I suggest that we have exhausted the subject ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>Do you remember your “ Arabian Nights , ” Lady Aline ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>Vaguely .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>You have at least not forgotten that sublime Caliph , Haroun</l>
       <l>Al-Raschid ?</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>Oh , no — but why ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>We millionaires are the Caliphs to-day ; and we command more faithful than ever bowed to them . And , like that old scoundrel Haroun , we may at times permit ourselves a respectable impulse . What is your cousin 's address ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>Again I ask — why ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>I will put him in a position to marry you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p><stage>In extreme surprise .</stage><stage>She rises .</stage>What !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>Oh , do n't be alarmed , I 'll manage it pleasantly . I 'll give him tips , shares , speculate for him , make him a director of one or two of my companies . He shall have an income of four thousand a year . You can live on that .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>You are not serious ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>Oh yes ; and though men may not like me , they always trust my word . You may .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>And why will you do this thing ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>Call it caprice — call it a mere vulgar desire to let my magnificence dazzle you — call it the less vulgar desire to know that my money has made you happy with the man you love .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>That is generous .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>I remember an old poem I learnt at school — which told how Frederick the Great coveted a mill that adjoined a favourite estate of his ; but the miller refused to sell . Frederick could have turned him out , of course — there was not very much public opinion in those days — but he respected the miller 's firmness , and left him in solid possession . And mark that , at that very same time , he annexed — in other words stole — the province of Silesia .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>Ah —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <lg>
       <stage>Moving to the fireplace .</stage>
       <l>“ Ce sont là jeux de Princes :</l>
       <l>Ils respectent un meunier ,</l>

     </sp>
     <stage>The music stops .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>You speak French ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>I am fond of it . It is the true and native language of insincerity .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>And yet you seem sincere .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>I am permitting myself that luxury to-night . I am uncorking , let us say , the one bottle of ‘ 47 port left in my cellar .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>You are not quite fair to yourself , perhaps .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>Do not let this action of mine cause you too suddenly to alter your opinion . The verdict you pronounced before was , on the whole , just .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>What verdict ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>I was the most unpleasant person you ever had met .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>That was an exaggeration .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>The most repulsive —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Quickly .</stage>I did not say that .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>And who prided himself on his repulsiveness . Very true , in the main , and yet consider ! My wealth dates back ten years ; till then I had known hunger , and every kind of sorrow and despair . I had stretched out longing arms to the world , but not a heart opened to me . And suddenly , when the taste of men 's cruelty was bitter in my mouth , capricious fortune snatched me from abject poverty and gave me delirious wealth . I was ploughing a barren field , and flung up a nugget . From that moment gold dogged my footsteps . I enriched the few friends I had — they turned howlingly from me because I did not give them more . I showered money on whoever sought it of me — they cursed me because it was mine to give . In my poverty there had been the bond of common sorrow between me and my fellows : in my wealth I stand alone , a modern Ishmael , with every man 's hand against me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Gently .</stage>Why do you tell me this ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>Because I am no longer asking you to marry me . Because you are the first person in all these years who has been truthful and frank with me . And because , perhaps , in the happiness that will , I trust , be yours , I want you to think kindly of me .<stage>She puts out her hand , he takes it .</stage>And now , shall we return to the ball-room ? The music has stopped ; they must be going to supper .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>What shall I say to the Marchioness , my mother , and the Duchess , my aunt ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>You will acquaint those noble ladies with the fact of your having refused me .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>They have both risen , and move up the room together .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>I shall be a nine days ’ wonder . And how do you propose to carry out your little scheme ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>I will take Saturday 's boat — you will give me a line to your cousin . I had better state the case plainly to him , perhaps ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>That demands consideration .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>And I will tell you what you shall do for me in return . Find me a wife ! ALINE . I ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>You . I beg it on my knees . I give you carte blanche . I undertake to propose , with my eyes shut , to the woman you shall select .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>And will you treat her to the — little preliminaries — with which you have favoured me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>No . I said those things to you because I liked you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>And you do n't intend to like the other one ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>I will marry her , I can trust you to find me a loyal and intelligent woman .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>In Society ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>For preference . She will be better versed in spending money than a governess , or country parson 's daughter .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>But why this voracity for marriage ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>Lady Aline , I am hunted , pestered , worried , persecuted . I have settled two breach of promise actions already , though Heaven knows I did no more than remark it was a fine day , or enquire after the lady 's health . If you do not help me , some energetic woman will capture me — I feel it — and bully me for the rest of my days . I raise a despairing cry to you — Find me a wife !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>Do you desire the lady to have any — special qualifications ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>No — the home-grown article will do . One thing , though — I should like her to be — merciful .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>I do n't understand .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>I have a vague desire to do something with my money : my wife might help me . I should like her to have pity .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>Pity ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>In the midst of her wealth I should wish her to be sorry for those who are poor .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>Yes . And , as regards the rest —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>The rest I leave to you , with absolute confidence . You will help me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>I will try . My choice is to be final ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>Absolutely .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>I have an intimate friend — I wonder whether she would do ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>Tell me about her .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>She and I made our debut the same season . Like myself she has hitherto been her mother 's despair .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>Because she has not yet —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>Married — yes . Oh , if men knew how hard the lot is of the portionless girl , who has to sit , and smile , and wait , with a very desolate heart — they would think less unkindly of her , perhaps —<stage>She smiles .</stage>But I am digressing , too .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>Tell me more of your friend .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>She is outwardly hard , and a trifle bitter , but I fancy sunshine would thaw her . There has not been much happiness in her life .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>Would she marry a man she did not love ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>If she did you would not respect her ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>I do n't say that . She will be your choice ; and therefore deserving of confidence . Is she handsome ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>Well — no .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p><stage>With a quick glance at her .</stage>That 's a pity . But we can n't have everything .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>No . There is one episode in her life that I feel she would like you to know —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>If you are not betraying a confidence —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Looking down .</stage>No . She loved a man , years ago , very dearly . They were too poor to marry , but they vowed to wait . Within six months she learned that he was engaged .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>Ah !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>To a fat and wealthy widow —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>The old story .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>Who was touring through India , and had been made love to by every unmarried officer in the regiment . She chose him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>India ?<stage>He moves towards her .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>I have an idea that I shall like your friend .<stage>He takes her hand in his .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>I shall be careful to tell her all that you said to me — at the beginning —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>It is quite possible that my remarks may not apply after all .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>But I believe myself from what I know of you both that — if she marries you — it will not be — altogether — for your money .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CROCKSTEAD</speaker>
      <p>Listen — they 're playing “ God Save the King . ” Will you be my wife , Aline ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALINE</speaker>
      <p>Yes — Harry .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He takes her in his arms and kisses her .</stage>

      <head>THE MAN ON THE KERB</head>
      <stage>SCENE : An underground room , bare of any furniture except two or three broken chairs , a tattered mattress on the stone floor and an old trunk . On a packing-chest are a few pots and pans and a kettle . A few sacks are spread over the floor , close to the empty grate ; the walls are discoloured , with plentiful signs of damp oozing through . Close to the door , at back , is a window , looking on to the area ; two of the panes are broken and stuffed with paper .</stage>
      <stage>On the mattress a child is sleeping , covered with a tattered old mantle ; MARY is bending over her , crooning a song . The woman is still quite young , and must have been very pretty ; but her cheeks are hollow and there are great circles round her eyes ; her face is very pale and bloodless . Her dress is painfully worn and shabby , but displays pathetic attempts at neatness . The only light in the room comes from the street lamp on the pavement above .</stage>
      <stage>JOE comes down the area steps , and enters . His clothes are of the familiar colourless , shapeless kind one sees at street corners ; he would be a pleasant-looking young fellow enough were it not that his face is abnormally lined , and pinched , and weather-beaten . He shambles in , with the intense weariness of a man who has for hours been forcing benumbed limbs to move ; he shakes himself , on the threshold , dog-fashion , to get rid of the rain . MARY first makes sure that the child is asleep , then rises eagerly and goes to him . Her face falls as she notes his air of dejection .</stage>
     </stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Wistfully .</stage>Nothing , Joe ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>Nothing . Not a farthing . Nothing .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>MARY turns away and checks a moan .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>Nothing at all . Same as yesterday — worse than yesterday — I did bring home a few coppers — And you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>A lady gave Minnie some food —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Heartily .</stage>Bless her for that !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>Took her into the pastrycook 's , Joe —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>And the kiddie had a tuck-out ? Thank God ! And you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>Minnie managed to hide a great big bun for me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>The lady did n't give you anything ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>Only a lecture , Joe , for bringing the child out on so bitter a day .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>With a sour laugh , as he sits on a chair .</stage>Ho , ho ! Always so ready with their lectures , are n't they ? “ Should n't beg , my man ! Never give to beggars in the street ! ” — Look at me , I said to one of them . Feel my arm . Tap my chest . I tell you I 'm starving , and they 're starving at home .— “ Never give to beggars in the street . ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Laying a hand on his arm .</stage>Oh , Joe , you 're wet !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>It 's been raining hard the last three hours — pouring . My stars , it 's cold . Could n't we raise a bit of fire , Mary ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>With what , Joe ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>After a look round , suddenly getting up , seizing a ricketty chair by the wall , breaking off the legs .</stage>With this ! Wonderful fine furniture they give you on the Hire System — so solid and substantial — as advertised .<stage>He breaks the flimsy thing up , as he speaks .</stage>And to think we paid for this muck , in the days we were human beings — paid about three times its value ! And to think of the poor devils , poor devils like us , who sweated their life-blood out to make it — and of the blood-sucking devils who sold it and got fat on it — and now back it goes to the devil it came from , and we can at least get warm for a minute .<stage>He crams the wood into the grate .</stage>Got any paper , Mary ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Taking an old newspaper from the trunk .</stage>Here , Joe .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>That will help to build up a fire .<stage>He glances at it , then lays it carefully underneath the wood . MARY gets lamp from table .</stage>The Daily Something or other — that tells the world what a happy people we are — how proud of belonging to an Empire on which the sun never sets . And I 'd sell Gibraltar to-night for a sausage with mashed potatoes ; and let Russia take India if some one would give me a clerkship at a pound a week .— There , in you go ! A match , Mary ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Standing above JOE , handing him one .</stage>Ok Joe , be careful — we 've only two left !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>I 'll be careful . Wait , though — I 'll see whether there 's a bit of tobacco still in my pipe .<stage>He fishes the pipe out of his pocket .</stage>A policeman who warned me away from the kerb gave me some tobacco . “ Must n't beg , ” he said . “ Got a pipe ? Well , here 's some tobacco . ” I believe he 'd have given me money . But it was the first kind word I had heard all day , and it choked me .— There 's just a bit left at the bottom .<stage>He bustles .</stage>Now , first the fire .<stage>He puts the match to the paper — it kindles .</stage>And then my pipe .<stage>The fire burns up ; he throws himself in front of it .</stage>Boo-o-oh , I 'm sizzling .... I got so wet that I felt the water running into my lungs — my feet did n't seem to belong to me — and as for my head and nose !<stage>Yawns .</stage>Well , smoke 's good — by the powers , I 'm getting warm — come closer to it , Mary . It 's a little after midnight now — and I left home , this fine , luxurious British home , just as soon as it was light . And I 've tramped the streets all day . Net result , a policeman gave me a pipeful of tobacco , I lunched off a bit of bread that I saw floating down the gutter — and I dined off the kitchen smell of the Café Royal . That 's my day .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Stroking his hand .</stage>Poor boy , poor boy !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>I stood for an hour in Leicester Square when the theatres emptied , thinking I might earn a copper , calling a cab , or something . There they were , all streaming out , happy and clean and warm — broughams and motor-cars — supper at the Savoy and the Carlton — and a hundred or two of us others in the gutter , hungry — looking at them . They went off to their supper — it was pouring , and I got soaked — and there I stood , dodging the policemen , dodging the horses ’ heads and the motors — and it was always — get away , you loafer , get away — get away — get away —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>We 've done nothing to deserve it , Joe —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>With sudden fury .</stage>Deserve it ! What have I ever done wrong ! Was n't my fault the firm went bankrupt and I could n't get another job . I 've a first-rate character — I 'm respectable — what 's the use ? I want to work — they wo n't let me !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>That illness of mine ate up all our savings . O Joe , I wish I had died !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>And left me alone ? That 's not kind of you , Mary . How about Mrs. Willis ? Is she worrying about the rent ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>Well , she 'd like to have it , of course — they 're so dreadfully poor themselves — but she says she wo n't turn us out . And I 'm going to-morrow to her daughter 's upstairs — she makes matchboxes , you know — and I do n't see why I should n't try — I could earn nearly a shilling a day .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>A shilling a day ! Princely !<stage>His pipe goes out . He takes a last puff at it , squints into it to make sure all the tobacco is gone , then lays it down with a sigh .</stage>I reckon I 'll try making ‘ em too . I went to the Vestry again , this morning , to see whether they 'd take me as sweeper — but they 've thirty names down , ahead of me . I 've tried chopping wood , but I can n't — I begin to cough the third stroke — there 's something wrong with me inside , somewhere . I 've tried every Institution on God 's earth — and there are others before me , and there is no vacancy , and I must n't beg , and I must n't worry the gentlemen . A shilling a day — can one earn as much as that ! Why , Mary , that will be fourteen shillings a week — an income ! We 'll do it !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>It 's not quite a shilling , Joe — you have to find your own paste and odds and ends . And of course it takes a few weeks to learn , before you begin to make any money .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Crestfallen .</stage>Does it though ? And what are we going to do , those few weeks ? I thought there was a catch in it , somewhere .<stage>He gets up and stretches himself .</stage>Well , here 's a free-born Englishman , able to conduct correspondence in three languages , bookkeeping by double entry , twelve years ’ experience — and all he 's allowed to do is to starve .<stage>He stretches himself again .</stage>But in spite of all temptations To belong to other nations —</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>With sudden passion . ] God ! I wish I were a Zulu !</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Edging to him .</stage>Joe —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Turning .</stage>Well ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>Joe , Joe , we 've tried very hard , have n't we ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>Tried ! Is there a job in this world we 'd refuse ? Is there anything we 'd turn up our nose at ? Is there any chance we 've neglected ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Stealing nervously to him and laying a hand on his arm .</stage>Joe —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Raising his head and looking at her .</stage>Yes — what is it ?<stage>She stands timidly with downcast eyes .</stage>Well ? Out with it , Mary !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Suddenly .</stage>It 's this , Joe .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>She goes feverishly to the mattress , and from underneath it she pulls out a big , fat purse which she hands him .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Staring .</stage>A purse !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Nodding .</stage>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>You —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>Found it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Looking at her .</stage>Found ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Awkwardly .</stage>In a way I did — yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>How ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>It came on to rain , Joe — and I went into a Tube Station — and was standing by a bookstall , showing Minnie the illustrated papers — and an old lady bought one — and she took out her purse — this purse — and paid for it — and laid the purse on the board while she fumbled to pick up her skirts — and then some one spoke to her — a friend , I suppose — and — there were lots of people standing about — I do n't know how it was — I was out in the street , with Minnie —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>You had the purse ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>Yes —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>No one followed you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>No one . I could n't run , as I had to carry Minnie .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>What made you do it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>I do n't know — something in me did it — She put the purse down just by the side of my hand — my fingers clutched it before I knew — and I was out in the street .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>How much is there in it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>I have n't looked , Joe .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Wondering .</stage>You have n't looked ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>No ; I did n't dare .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Sorrowfully .</stage>I did n't think we 'd come to this , Mary .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Desperately .</stage>We 've got to do something . Before we can earn any money at making matchboxes we 'll have to spend some weeks learning . And you 've not had a decent meal for a month — nor have I . If there 's money inside this purse you can get some clothes — and for me too — I need them ! It 's not as though the old lady would miss it — she 's rich enough — her cloak was real sable — and no one can find us out — they can n't tell one piece of money from the other . It 's heavy , Joe — I think there 's a lot inside .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Weighing it mechanically .</stage>Yes — it 's heavy —</p>
     </sp>

      <p><stage>Eagerly .</stage>Open it , Joe .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Turning to her again .</stage>Why did n't you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>I just thought I 'd wait — I 'd an idea something might have happened ; that some one might have stopped you in the street , some one with a heart — and that he 'd have come in with you to-night — and seen us — seen Minnie — and said — “ Well , here 's money — I 'll put you on your legs again ” — And then we 'd have given the purse back , Joe .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>As he still mechanically balances it in his hand .</stage>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>Ca n't go on like this , can we ? You 'll cough all night again , as you did yesterday — and the stuff they gave you at the Dispensary 's no good . If you had clothes , you might get some sort of a job perhaps — you know you had to give up trying because you were so shabby .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>They laugh at me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>With a glance at herself .</stage>And I 'm really ashamed to walk through the streets —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>I know — though I 'm getting used to it . Besides , there 's the kiddie . Let 's have a look at her .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>Be careful you do n't wake her , Joe !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>There 's a fire .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>She 'll be hungry .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>You said that she had some food ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>That was at three o'clock . And little things are n't like us — they want their regular meals . Night after night she has been hungry , and I 've had nothing to give her . That 's why I took the purse .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Still holding it mechanically and staring at it .</stage>Yes . And , after all , why not ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>We can get the poor little thing some warm clothes , some good food —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Under his breath .</stage>A thief 's daughter .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Covers his face with his hands .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>Joe !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>Not nice , is it ? Ca n't be helped , of course . And who cares ? For three months this game has gone on — we getting shabbier , wretcheder , hungrier — no one bothers — all they say is “ keep off the pavement . ” Let 's see what 's in the purse .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Eagerly .</stage>Yes , yes !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <lg>
       <stage>Lifting his head as he is on the point of opening the purse .</stage>
       <l>That 's the policeman passing .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Impatiently .</stage>Never mind that —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Turning to the purse again .</stage>First time in my life I 've been afraid when I heard the policeman .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He has his finger on the catch of the purse when he pauses for a moment — then acting on a sudden impulse , makes a dart for the door , opens it , and is out , and up the area steps .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>With a despairing cry .</stage>Joe !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>She flings herself on the mattress , and sobs silently , so as not to awaken , the child . JOE returns , hanging his head , dragging one foot before the other .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Still sobbing , but trying to control herself .</stage>Why did you do that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Humbly .</stage>I do n't know —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>You gave it to the policeman ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>What did you tell him ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>That you had found it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>Where ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>In a Tube Station . Picked it up because we were starving . That we had n't opened it . And that we lived here , in this cellar .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>With a little shake .</stage>I expect he 'll keep it himself !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Miserably .</stage>Perhaps .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>There is silence for a moment ; she has ceased to cry ; suddenly she raises herself violently on her elbow .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>You fool ! You fool !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p><stage>Pleading .</stage>Mary !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>With your stupid ideas of honesty ! What have they done for you , or me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Dropping his head again .</stage>It 's the kiddie , you know — her being a thief 's daughter —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>Is that worse than being the daughter of a pair of miserable beggars ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Under his breath .</stage>I suppose it is , somehow —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>You 'd rather she went hungry ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Despairingly .</stage>I do n't know how it was — hearing his tramp up there —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>You were afraid ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>I do n't want you taken to prison .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>With a wail .</stage>I 'll be taken to the graveyard soon , in a pauper 's coffin !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Starts suddenly .</stage>Suppose we did that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Staring .</stage>The workhouse ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>Why not , after all ? That 's what it will come to , sooner or later .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>They 'd separate us .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>At least you and the kiddie 'd have food .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>They 'd separate us . And I love you , Joe . My poor , poor Joe ! I love you .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>She nestles up to him and takes his hand .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Holding her hand in his , and bending over her .</stage>You forgive me for returning the purse ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Dropping her head on his shoulder .</stage>Forgive you ! You were right . It was the cold and the hunger maddened me . You were right !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <lg>
       <stage>Springing to his feet , with sudden passion . MARY staggers back .</stage>
       <l>I was n't right — I was a coward , a criminal — a vile and wicked fool .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Startled .</stage>Joe !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>I had money there — money in my hand — money that you need so badly , you , the woman I love with all my ragged soul — money that would have put food into the body of my little girl — money that was mine , that belonged to me — and I 've given it back , because of my rotten honesty ! What right have I to be honest ? They 've made a dog of me — what business had I to remember I was a man ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Following him and laying a hand on his arm .</stage>Hush , Joe — you 'll wake Minnie .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Turning and staring haggardly at her .</stage>I could have got clothes — a job , perhaps — we might have left this cellar . We could have gone out to-morrow and bought things — gone into shops — we might have had food , coal —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>Do n't , Joe — what 's the use ? And who knows — it may prove a blessing to us . You told the policeman where we lived ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>A blessing ! I 'll get up to-morrow , after having coughed out my lungs all night — and I 'll go into the streets and walk there from left to right and from right to left , standing at this corner and at that , peering into men 's faces , watching people go to their shops and their offices , people who are warm and comfortable — and so it will go on , till the end comes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <lg>
       <stage>Standing very close to him , almost in a whisper .</stage>
       <l>Why not now ,</l>
       <l>Joe ?</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>With a startled glance at her .</stage>The end ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>There 's no room for us in this world —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>If I 'd taken that money —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>It 's too late for that now . And I 'm glad you did n't — yes , I am — I 'm glad . We 'll go before God clean-handed . And we 'll say to Him we did n't steal , or do anything He did n't want us too . And we 'll tell Him we 've died because people would n't allow us to live .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>With a shudder .</stage>No . Not that — we 'll wait , Mary . Do n't speak of that .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Wistfully .</stage>You 've thought of it too ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>Thought of it ! Do n't , Mary , do n't ! It 's bad enough , in the night , when I lie there and think of to-morrow ! Something will happen — it must .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>What ? We have n't a friend in the world .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>I may meet some one I used to know .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>You 've met them before — they always refuse —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Passionately .</stage>I 've done nothing wrong — I have n't drunk or gambled — I can n't help being only a clerk , and unable to do heavy work ! I can n't help my lungs being weak ! I 've a wife and a child , like other people — and all we ask is to be allowed to live !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Pleading .</stage>Let 's give it up , Joe . Go away together , you 'd sleep without coughing . Sleep , that 's all . And God will be kinder than men .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Groaning .</stage>Do n't , Mary — do n't !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>Joe , I can n't stand it any longer — I can n't . Not only myself — but Minnie — Joe , it 's too much for me ! I can n't stand Minnie crying , and asking me for her breakfast , as she will in the morning . Joe , dear Joe , let there be no morning !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Completely overcome .</stage>Oh , Mary , Mary !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>It 's not your fault , dear — you 've done what you could . Not your fault they wo n't let you work — you 've tried hard enough . And no woman ever had a better husband than you 've been to me . I love you , dear Joe . And let 's do it — let 's make an end . And take Minnie with us .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Springing up .</stage>Mary , I 'll steal something to-morrow .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>And they 'd send you to prison . Besides , then God would be angry . Now we can go to Him and need not be ashamed . Let us , dear Joe — oh , do let us ! I 'm so tired !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>No .</p>

      <p>You 've seen them in there , have n't you ?</p>

      <p>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>You 've seen them standing at the window , staring at the world ? And they 'd take you away from me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p>That 's better than —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Firmly .</stage>I wo n't do it , Joe . I 've been a good wife to you — I 've been a good mother : and I love you , though I 'm ragged and have pawned all my clothes ; and I 'll strangle myself rather than go to the workhouse and be shut away from you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOE</speaker>
      <p><stage>With a loud cry .</stage>No ! I 'll make them give me something ; and if I have to kill , it sha n't be my wife and child ! To-morrow I 'll come home with food and money — to-morrow —</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>There is a sudden wail from the child ; JOE stops and stares at her ; MARY goes quickly to the mattress and soothes the little girl .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>Hush , dear , hush — no it 's not morning yet , not time for breakfast . Go to sleep again , dear . Yes , daddy 's come back , and things are going to be all right now — No , dear , you can n't be hungry , really — remember those beautiful cakes . Go to sleep , Minnie , dear . You 're cold ?<stage>She takes off her ragged shawl and wraps it round the child .</stage>There , dear , you wo n't be cold now . Go to sleep , Minnie —</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>The child 's wail dies away , as MARY soothes her back to sleep .</stage>
     <sp>

      <head>THE OPEN DOOR</head>
      <stage>SCENE : The drawing-room of LORD TORMINSTER 'S cottage by the sea . It is 2 a. m. of a fine July night ; the French windows are open on to the lawn . The room is dark ; in an armchair , SIR GEOFFREY TRANSOM , a man of forty , with a frank , pleasant face , is seated , deep in thought . Suddenly the door opens , and LADY TORMINSTER appears and switches on the light . She starts at seeing SIR GEOFFREY .</stage>

      <p>Oh !</p>

      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>What a start you gave me Why have n't you gone to bed ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>I 'm tired of going to bed . One always has to get up again , and it becomes monotonous . Why have n't you gone to sleep ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>I do n't know — it 's too hot , or something . I 've come for a book .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>Let me choose one for you .</p>

     <stage>He goes to the table .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>Why were you sitting in the dark ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>Because the light annoyed me . What sort of book will you have ? A red one or a green one ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>Is there a virtue in the colour of the binding ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>Why not ? They 're all the same inside . There are three hundred ways , they say , of cooking a potato — there are as many of dressing up a lie , and calling it a novel . But it 's always the same old lie . Here take this .<stage>He hands her a book .</stage>Popular Astronomy . That will send you to sleep .</p>

      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>

     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>Pooh ! You are more dressed than you were at dinner . That 's awfully rude , is n't it ? But then , you see , you 're not my hostess now — you 're a spirit , walking in the night . One can n't be polite to spirits . Sit down , oh shade , and let us converse .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Hesitating .</stage>I do n't know —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>The household have all retired ; and we will make this concession to Mrs. Grundy — we will leave the door open . There !<stage>He flings it open .</stage>The Open Door ! Centuries ago , when I was alive , I remember paragraphs with that heading .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Laughing .</stage>So you 're not alive now ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>Sir Geoffrey Transom ceased to be when he said good-night to Lady Torminster . Sir Geoffrey is upstairs asleep . So is her ladyship . We are their souls . Let us talk .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>You are in your whimsical mood .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>And you in your wrapper — peignoir — tea gown — it do n't matter what you call it . You look — jolly . Ridiculous word — I do n't mean that at all . You look — you . More you than I 've seen you for years . Sh — do n't interrupt . Shades never do that . By the way , do you know that the old lumber-room , my owner — my corporeal sheath — means to go away in the morning , before you are up ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>Sir Geoffrey ! What nonsense ! You 've promised to stay a month !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>I assure you I have been charged to invent fitting and appropriate lies to account for the ridiculous creature 's abrupt departure . The man Transom is a poor liar .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>You are making me giddy . Would you mind putting on your body ? I 've not been introduced to your soul .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Springing up with a flourish .</stage>How very remiss of me ! Permit me . Gertrude this is Geoffrey . You have often heard me speak of him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Rising .</stage>I think I 'll go to bed .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>Now that is preposterous . Jack , my dear old friend — the best and only friend I have in the world — is slumbering peacefully upstairs , and Jack 's wife is reluctant to talk to Jack 's old pal because the sun happens to be hidden on the other side of the globe . Lady Torminster , sit down . If you 're good you shall have a cigarette .</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>

       <stage>Sitting .</stage>
       <l>Well , just one . And when I 've finished it ,</l>
       <l>I 'll go .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>Agreed .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He hands her the box ; she takes a cigarette ; he strikes a match and holds it for her ; he then takes a cigarette himself , and lights it .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>And , while smoking it , remember Penelope 's web . For I 've heaps of things to tell you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>They 'll keep till to-morrow .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>That 's a fearful delusion . Nothing keeps . There is one law in the universe : NOW .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>I want to know what you mean by this nonsense about your going .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Puffing out smoke .</stage>Yes — I 'm off in the morning . It has occurred to me that I have n't been to China . Now that is a serious omission . How can I face my forefathers , and confess to them that I have n't seen the land where the Yellow Labour comes from ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>China has waited a long time — a month more or less will make no difference . They are a patient race .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>There is gipsy blood in my veins — I must wander — I 'm restless .... Not like Jack — he 's untroubled — he can sleep . Jack 's a fine sleeper , is n't he ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>Calm , serene , untroubled , with the conscience of a babe — one , two , three , he sleeps . He and I have had some rare times together . I 've been roped to him on the Andes — he shot a tiger that was about to scrunch me — I rubbed his nose when it was frost-bitten . He saved my life — I saved his nose . I always maintain that the balance of gratitude is on his side — for where would he have been without his nose ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>You are absurd .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>Would you have married him without a nose ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>I might have .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>Now you know you would n't . You 'd have been afraid of what people would say . And what would he have done when he became short-sighted , and had to wear glasses ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>My cigarette has gone out .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Jumping up and handing her the box .</stage>Take another . Never re-light a cigarette — it 's like dragging up the past . Here .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>I said only one .</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>

       <l>This is not the hour for inflexibility . The Medes and</l>
       <l>Persians have all gone to bed .</l>

     <stage>She takes the cigarette ; he lights it for her .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>Tell me why you mean to leave us . And remember — I sha n't let this one go out .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>My explanation will be handed to you with your cup of tea in the morning .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>And you will be gone ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>I shall be gone . There is a train at 7. 45 — which will be packed with husbands . I shall breakfast in town .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>Why ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>Well , one must breakfast somewhere . It 's a convention .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>Sir Geoffrey , I want you to tell me what this means .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>Give your decision , said the judge to the arbitrator , but never your reasons . I go , because I go . Besides , has one reasons ? Why do people die , or get married , or buy umbrellas ? Because of typhoid , love , or the rain ? Not at all . Is n't that so ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>I wish you 'd be serious .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>I 'm fearfully serious . When Jack shot that tiger he had to go so near the brute that he held his life in his hands . Do you know what was my chief impression as I lay there , with the ugly cat 's paw upon my chest , beginning to rip me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Shuddering .</stage>Horrible ! What ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>I resented his having eaten something that smelt like onions .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>A tiger !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>Onions may have been his undoing . That 's the beggar 's skin on the floor . But you should have seen me rub Jack 's nose !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Warningly .</stage>Sir Geoffrey , there 's very little cigarette left —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>There are lots more in the box — and dawn is a long way off . Hang it , Lady Torminster , do n't be in a hurry ! Do you hear the sea out there ? It 's breathing as regularly as old Jack . And do n't you think this is fine ? Here we are , we two , meeting just as we shall meet on the other side of the Never-Never Land . It 's a chance for a man to speak to a woman , and tell her things .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>What things !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>That 's just it — what things ? What have I to say , after all ? I am going to-morrow because I am a fantastic , capricious ass . Also because I 'm lonely .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>How will China help you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>They colour it green on the map — and there is such a lot of it !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>You should get married .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p><stage>With a sudden burst of passion .</stage>You say that — you !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He starts back , ashamed , and hangs his head . LADY TORMINSTER throws a quick glance at him , then looks ahead of her , puffing quietly at her cigarette .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Quietly .</stage>So that is why you are going ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p><stage>With a great sigh of relief .</stage>Now , that really is fine of you ! Every other woman in the world would have seized that chance for a melodramatic exit . “ Good-night , Sir Geoffrey ; I must go to my husband . ” “ Good-night , Lady Torminster . ” A clasp of the hand — a hot tear — mine — on your wrist . But you sit there . Splendid !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>I ask you again — is that truly why you are going ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>Well , yes , that 's the fact . I apologise humbly — it 's so conventional . Is n't it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>I suppose it 's difficult for human beings to invent new situations .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>You 've known it , of course , all the time ; you 've known it ever since Jack brought me to you , the day after you were engaged . And that 's nine years ago . It 's the usual kind of fatality .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>These things happen .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>Yes . Well , I thought I was cured . I 've been here five days , and I find I am not . So I go . That 's best , is n't it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>It 's so infernally stupid . You 're a beautiful woman , of course ; but there are heaps of beautiful women . You 've qualities — well , so have other women , too . I 'm only forty-one — and , as you say , why do n't I marry ? Simply because of you . Because you 've an uncomfortable knack of intruding between me and the other lady .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>That is a great misfortune .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>It 's most annoying . So I shall try China . I shall come back in two years — I shall be forty-three then — I shall come back , sound as a bell ; and I shall marry some healthy , pink-cheeked young woman , take a house next to yours , and in the fulness of time your eldest son shall fall in love with my daughter .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>Why not ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>I should n't have told you , of course ; but I 'm glad that I have . It clears the air . Now what excuse shall I make ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>A wire from town ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>Jack knows all about my affairs ; in fact , that 's why I take the early train , to avoid his questions .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>You find it impossible to stay out your time here ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>Quite . There are moments when I am unpleasantly volcanic .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>Then I tell you the best thing to do . Do n't take your trunks ; just go up with a bag . Leave a note that you 'll come back on Tuesday . Then write from town and say you 're prevented .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>That 's a good idea — yes , that 's much better .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>And , if you find that you really cannot come back —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>Exactly ; you 'll forward my goods and chattels . And old Jack will ascribe it all to my wayward mood ; he 'll think I have found it too dull down here . I 'm immensely obliged .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>With a smile .</stage>Remark that I 've not offered to be a sister to you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>You 've been superb . Oh , the good talk we 've had ! Do you know , I could almost wish old Jack to have heard what I said . I 'm so fond of him , that grand old fellow , that I 've been on the point of telling him , myself , more than once . For you know he will have me take you about , and it 's painful . Besides , I 've felt it almost disloyal to — keep this thing from him . You understand , do n't you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>He and I almost are one , you see . It 's not British to show any feeling , but really I — love him . And the devil comes along , and , of all women in the world , singles out Jack 's wife , and fills my heart with her . That 's the devil 's sense of humour .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>Perhaps he has read Bernard Shaw . But you must never let</l>
       <l>Jack know — never .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>I suppose not . He 's so direct , so single-minded , that the shock would be terrible . But I 'm not to blame . How could I help it ? Oh , all that cackle about being master of one 's fate !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>Two years in China —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>We 'll hope so . Of course , it did n't matter about my telling you , because you knew already .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Nodding</stage>Yes , I knew . Although —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>Oh , you 've done what you could ! I 've felt , in a hundred subtle ways , how you almost implored me — not to . Well , there it is . I 'll write that note at once .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He sits at the table and begins to write .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>I 'm sorry you are so lonely .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>That 's my fault , too — the fault of the ridiculous class to which we belong . I do n't do anything .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>Why not ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>What would you have me do ? Go into the House ? Thank you , I 've been there . You spend your time on the Terrace or in the smoke-room till a muffin-bell rings ; then you gravely walk into the lobby , where an energetic gentleman counts you as Polyphemus counted his sheep . Philanthropy ! Well , I 've tried that , but it 's not in my line . I 'm quite a respectable landlord , but a fellow can n't live all by himself in a great Elizabethan barrack . Town — the Season ? Christian mothers invite you to inspect their daughters ’ shoulders , with a view to purchase . I 'm tired of golf and polo ; I 'm tired of bridge . So I 'll try the good sea and the open plains ; sleep in a tent and watch the stars twinkle — the stars that make you afraid .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>Yes , I 'm afraid of the stars .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>Why ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>You remember the Persian poet ? “ I too have said to the stars and the wind , I will . But the wind and the stars have mocked me — they have laughed in my face .... ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p><stage>A little uncomfortable .</stage>Persian poets , like all poets , have a funny way of pretending that the stars take an interest in us . To me , it 's their chief charm that they 're so unconcerned . They are lonely , too .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Suddenly , violently .</stage>Do n't say that again — do n't — I can n't bear it !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Aghast .</stage>Gertrude !! !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>In a whisper .</stage>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He stares haggardly at her ; she does not move , but looks out , through the open window , into the night .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p><stage>With a deep breath .</stage>Well , I suppose we had better turn in —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>When do you go to China ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>I shall take the first boat .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>And you will come back —?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>In a year — or two — or three —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>We shall hear from you ?</p>

      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p><stage>With an effort of lightness .</stage>Certainly . And I will send you chests of tea — best family Souchong — and jars of ginger . Also little boxes that fit into each other . I am afraid that is all I know at present of Chinese manufactures .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Musing .</stage>You will be away so long ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>You told me to do something . I shall learn Chinese . I believe there are five hundred letters in the alphabet .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>As many as that !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>It is possible that I exaggerate . Well , Lady Torminster , I think I 'll say good-night .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He offers his hand , which she ignores . She smiles , and motions him back to his seat .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>The sun is still shining in the antipodes , my dear Geoffrey , and you are still Jack 's old friend , talking to Jack 's wife . Sit down , and do n't be foolish . You 'll be away for years ; it 's possible we may never meet again . It 's possible , too , that next time we do meet you may be married .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p><stage>With iron control .</stage>Who knows ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>Exactly — who knows ? So there 's no reason why we should n't look each other squarely in the face for once , and speak out what 's in us .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Sorrowfully .</stage>Oh , Lady Torminster , what is there to say ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Bending forward a little and smiling .</stage>How you resent my having told you !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p><stage>With a guilty start .</stage>Resent ! I !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>You do , and you know it . In your heart you are saying , “ All was going so well — she has spoiled it ! If she does love me she should n't have said it — Jack 's wife ! ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Sturdily .</stage>Well — Jack 's wife . Yes !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>Geoffrey , Jack bores me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Aghast .</stage>Lady Torminster !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Clapping her hands in glee .</stage>There ! I 've said it ! Oh , it 's such a relief ! I never have before , and I do n't suppose I ever shall again — for whom can I say it to but you ? Listen — I tell you — quite entre nous — he bores me shockingly !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p><stage>In positive distress .</stage>Lady Torminster ! I beg of you !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Cheerfully .</stage>The best fellow in all the world , and he bores me . A heart of gold , a model husband , a perfect father — and a bore , bore , bore ! There ! I assure you I feel better .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>I suppose there are moments when every woman says that of every man .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Fanning herself .</stage>My dear Geoffrey , please send for your soul ; it has wandered off somewhere , and I do n't like talking to copybooks .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Doggedly .</stage>You are talking to Jack 's friend .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>Jack 's friend — and mine — do n't forget that ! And could I say these things about Jack to any one else , and can n't you conceive what a joy it is to say them ? Besides , are n't we just now on the rim of the world — are n't we a little more than ourselves — are n't we almost on the other side of things ? If we ever meet again , we shall look curiously at each other , and wonder , was it all true ? As it is , I am scarcely sure that you are real . Everything is so still , so strange . Jack ! He is up there , of course , the dear boy , his big red face pressed on the pillow . Oh , Geoffrey , when Jack brought you to me , and I was engaged — if you only had n't been so loyal !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Grimly .</stage>Do you know what you are saying ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>I am saying the things a woman says once in a lifetime , and feels all her life . Oh , it was all so simple ! You loved me — you ... were blind because of Jack ... And I married Jack ... I must n't complain ... I am one of the hundreds of women who marry — Jacks .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>A better , finer man never lived .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>I dare say — in fact , I am sure . But you should see us when we are alone , sitting there night after night , with never a word to say to each other ! You tell me you 're tired of polo , and golf , and bridge . Well , how about me ? And need you be scowling so fiercely , and begrudge me my one little wail , you who are going away ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <lg>
       <stage>Angrily .</stage>
       <l>Yes , I am going away , and I shall marry a</l>
       <l>Chinese . I shall marry the first Chinese woman I meet .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>This is very sudden . Why ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>Because , at least , not knowing the language , she wo n't be able to say unkind things about me to my friends .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <lg>
       <stage>Her chin on her hand , looking squarely at him .</stage>
       <l>Geoffrey , is Jack a bore ?</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>He never bores me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>That 's because he shot your tiger , and you rubbed his nose . Besides , you talk about horses , and so on . And yet I heard him , for a solid hour , telling you about a rubber he lost at bridge through his partner making diamonds trumps when he should have made spades .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>He 's not clever , of course — and you are . But still ! Is cleverness everything ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>Have n't I told you he 's the very best fellow in all the world ? And do you think I 'm posing , pretending that I 'm misunderstood , and the rest ? You know me better . I am indulging , for once , in the luxury of absolute candour .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>You loved him —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>Of course I loved him — and I love him now .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Triumphantly .</stage>You see !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>If we women had had a hand in the making of the language , how many words there would be to express our feelings towards the men we are fond of ! Of course I love Jack . I 'm cruel to him sometimes ; and there comes a look into his eyes — he has dog 's eyes , you know — a faithful Newfoundland —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Very earnestly .</stage>I do n't think women quite realise what friendship means to a man .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>I am certain that men do n't realise what marriage means to a woman ! Dear funeral , am I not a good wife — shall I not remain a good wife , till the end of the chapter ? Because there is n't only Jack — there are Jack 's children .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>And is n't it wonderful , when you think of it — here are we two , Jack 's friend and his wife , alone on a desert island — and we have confessed our love for each other , and we are able to discuss it as calmly as though it were rheumatism !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p><stage>With a groan .</stage>If only I had n't induced you to stay !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>My dear friend , you did n't !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Amazed .</stage>I did n't ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>Why no — of course not . I knew you were going to-morrow .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>How ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>Oh , never mind how ! I knew . And I suspected you would be sitting up here to-night . So I came down , hoping to find you . I wanted this talk with you . And I extracted your confession — as though it had been a tooth .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>And why ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>Why ? Because it will be something to think of , in the dull days ahead . Because I knew that you loved me , and wanted to be told . Because your life lies before you , and mine is ended . Because I love you , and insisted that you should know . You leave me now , and I have no illusions . Paolo and Francesca are merely a poet 's dream . You will marry — of course you will marry — but this moment , at least , has been mine .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Stretching out yearning hands .</stage>This moment , and every moment , in past and future !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>Ah , the future ! Strange little syllables that hide so much ! I can see you , introducing your wife to me , a little shyly — I can see myself , shaking hands with her — and with you .... My boy is seven already — time travels fast .... But it 's good to know that you really have loved me , all these years ....</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>By day and by night — you , and only you !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>And I have loved you — ah , yes , I have loved you !... And , having said this to each other , we will not meet again — till you bring me your wife .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p>Ah — then !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>I have loved you , and I love you , for the fine , upright , loyal creature that you are . I love you for loving Jack ; and it is Jack 's great quality in my eyes that he has been able to inspire such love . And , my dear friend , let us not be ashamed , we two , but only very proud , and very happy . We shall go our ways , and do our duty ; but we shall never forget this talk we have had to-night .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Gently .</stage>I am beginning to understand ....</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p>You will be less lonely in future ... and I no longer afraid of the stars .... Brave heart — oh , brave little heart that I for a moment have held in my hands !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIR GEOFFREY</speaker>
      <p><stage>With a passionate movement towards her .</stage>Gertrude !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY TORMINSTER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Lifting a finger .</stage>No — stay where you are .... Those are the first rays of dawn — I must go .... Good-bye . We have no need to shake hands , you and I .... Ah , Geoffrey — good-bye !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>She goes swiftly , and closes the door . He bends his head , and remains standing , motionless , by the table .</stage>

      <docTitle><titlePart>THE BRACELET The dining-room in an upper middle-class house near the Park . It is furnished in the conventional modern style , soberly and without imagination . The room is on the ground floor , facing the street , the door is to the right , and leads into the hall . To the left of this door is a sideboard , glittering with silver . Three tall windows , at the back heavily curtained ; between them hang two or three family portraits . The table , on which there is the usual debris of a meal that is over — coffee-cups , liqueur-glasses , etc .— has been laid for four persons , and their four chairs are still around it . The fireplace , with its rather crude and ambitious mantelpiece , is in the centre of the left wall ; and uncomfortable-looking heavy armchairs are on each side of it . On the mantelpiece are a marble clock and a few bits of china . In the angle formed at the left side is a small Queen Anne writing-table , open . To the right of the room is a large sofa . The floor is heavily carpeted , and there are many rugs scattered about . When the curtain rises , the room is in darkness . WILLIAM , the footman , enters hurriedly and switches on the electric light . He rushes to the table , looks eagerly around , shifting cups and glasses , napkins , etc ., then goes on his hands and knees and searches on the carpet . After a moment , SMITHERS , the lady'shYpppHeNmaid , follows him . SMITHERS . [ Eagerly . ] Ca n't you find it ? WILLIAM . [ Sulkily . ] No . Not yet . Give me time . SMITHERS . [ Feeling along the table-cloth . ] Under one of those rugs , perhaps . WILLIAM . Well , I 'm looking . [ Motor-horn sounds sharply , off . ] All right , all right ! SMITHERS . [ With a jerk of the head . ] Missis is telling him to do it . WILLIAM . [ On all fours , crawling about . ] Very like her voice , too , when she 's angry . Drat the thing ! Where can it be ? [ He peers into the coal-scuttle . SMITHERS . No good looking in there , stupid . WILLIAM . They always say it 's the unlikeliest places — [ MARTIN , the butler , comes in . MARTIN . Come , come , have n't you found it ? WILLIAM . No , Mr. Martin . It ai n't here . MARTIN . [ Bustling about . ] Must be , must be . She says — WILLIAM . I can n't help what she says . It ai n't . MARTIN . [ Looking under the sofa . ] Just you hustle , young man , and do n't give me any back-answers . [ Having completed his examination of the sofa , he moves to the sideboard , and fusses round that . SMITHERS . [ Methodically shaking out each napkin . ] I tell you she 's cross . MARTIN . [ Hard at work , searching . ] Does n't mind disturbing us , in the midst of our supper ! WILLIAM . [ Who , all the time , has been on all fours searching . ] We 're dirt , that 's what we are — dirt . MARTIN . [ Reprovingly . ] William , I 've told you before — WILLIAM . Very sorry , Mr. Martin , but this is the first time I 've accepted an engagement at a stockbroker 's . [ He has been crawling round the curtains at the back , shaking them ; pulling hard at one of them he dislodges the lower part . ] Lor ! Now I 've done it ! SMITHERS . Clumsy ! MARTIN . [ Severely . ] That comes of too much talk Never mind the curtain — go on looking . [ WILLIAM drops on to his hands and knees again ; HARVEY WESTERN comes into the room , perturbed and restless . He is a well-preserved man of fifty . HARVEY . I say — not found it ? MARTIN . Not yet , sir . HARVEY . Nuisance . Must be here , you know . MARTIN . Is it a very valuable one , sir ? HARVEY . [ Who has gone to the table , and is turning things over . ] No , no , not particularly — but that 's not the point . [ He looks under the table . MARTIN . [ Still seeking . ] When did madam find that she 'd lost it , sir ? HARVEY . Oh , about five minutes after we 'd started And we 've turned over everything in the car . It 's certainly not there . [ He fusses around the table . MARTIN . Is madam quite sure she was wearing it , sir ? SMITHERS . [ Fretfully . ] Yes , yes , of course she was wearing it . I put it on her myself . MARTIN . Where did madam put her cloak on , sir ? SMITHERS . In here . I brought it in . MARTIN . You did n't notice whether — SMITHERS . No . Do n't you think if we moved all the rugs — [ She moves across the room and joins WILLIAM , who is still grovelling on the floor , and goes on her knees by his side . HARVEY . It must be here somewhere . [ They are all searching furiously — WILLIAM by the windows , peering into the spaces between the wall and the carpets , MARTIN at the sideboard , SMITHERS gathering the rugs together , all on their hands and knees , while HARVEY , bent double , is looking under the table . MRS. WESTERN comes in stonily , followed by the JUDGE and MRS. BANKET . MRS. WESTERN is a handsome woman of forty-five , with a rather stern , cold face ; the JUDGE , a somewhat corpulent , genial man of fifty-five ; and his wife , an amiable nullity , seven or eight years younger . They are all in evening-dress , the ladies in opera-cloaks . MRS. WESTERN . [ Pausing on the threshold . ] Well ! HARVEY . [ Rising and dusting himself . ] No trace of it . MRS. WESTERN . [ Looking around . ] A nice mess you 've made of the room ! MARTIN . You told us to look , Madam . JUDGE . [ Going to the fire and standing with his back to it . ] I 'm afraid we 'll be shockingly late , Alice . MRS. WESTERN . [ Firmly . ] I do n't go without my bracelet . [ She goes to the table , and proceeds to shift the cups and glasses . MRS. BANKET . [ Moving to the other side of the table , and doing the same . ] Quite right , dear — I would n't . [ They all search , except the JUDGE , who shrugs his shoulders placidly , then takes a cigarette from his case , and lights it . The three servants still are grovelling on the floor . MRS. WESTERN . I know I had it while I was drinking my coffee — JUDGE . My experience is , one should never look for things . They find themselves . MRS. WESTERN . [ Shortly . ] Nonsense . JUDGE . A fact . Or at least one should pretend to be looking for something else . My glasses now . When I lose them I declare loudly I can n't find my cigar-case . That disheartens the glasses — they return at once . MRS. BANKET . [ Reproachfully . ] Do n't be so irritating , Tom ! JUDGE . That 's all very well , but how about me ? I was asked here to dine . I 've dined — I 'm not complaining about the dinner . But now the curtain 's up — and here am I watching half-a-dozen people looking very hard for a thing that is n't there . MRS. BANKET . Tom , Tom , it 's those laughs you get in Court that make you so fond of talking . Do n't you see how you 're vexing your sister ? MRS. WESTERN . Oh , I 'm used to Tom . Harvey , I think you might be looking . HARVEY . My dear , I 've been turning round and round in this corner like a bird in a cage . MARTIN . [ Who all this time , like the other servants , has been crawling around the different articles of furniture in the room , suddenly rises to his feet and addresses his mistress firmly but respectfully . ] It 's not here , madam . [ The other servants also rise ; and stand , each in their corner . JUDGE . That , I imagine , is perfectly clear ; and I congratulate the witness on the manner in which he has given his evidence . [ He throws his cigarette into the fire and steps forward . ] Now , my dear Alice — MRS. WESTERN . [ Sitting doggedly in the chair in front of the table and proceeding to pull off her gloves . I do n't go without my bracelet . JUDGE . Heaven forbid that I should speak slightingly of a gift of Harvey 's — but really it is n't of such priceless value . MRS. WESTERN . That has nothing to do with it . MRS. BANKET . Of course not . Oh , these men ! HARVEY . [ Stepping forward . ] Tom 's right . Let 's go . Look here , I 'll get you another . MRS. WESTERN . [ Drily . ] Thanks — I want that one .— Smithers , and you , William , just look again in the hall . SMITHERS . Yes , m 'm . MRS. WESTERN . And then help the chauffeur — turn out everything in the car . SMITHERS . Yes , m 'm . MRS. WESTERN . Bring the rugs into the house , and shake them . SMITHERS . Yes , m 'm . [ She and WILLIAM go . JUDGE . [ Going hack to the fire . ] Sumptuary laws — that 's what we want . If women did n't wear bracelets , they could n't lose them . MRS. WESTERN . Martin , William is honest , is n't he ? HARVEY . [ Protesting . ] Oh , hang it , Alice ! MARTIN . Quite , madam — excellent character — a little flighty , but a most respectable young man . MRS. WESTERN . I 've seen him reading a sporting paper . JUDGE . A weakness , my dear Alice , common to the best of us , I do it myself sometimes , but I 'm willing to be searched . MRS. BANKET . O Tom , do be quiet ! MRS. WESTERN . [ To the JUDGE . ] You 're very unsympathetic . [ Turning to MARTIN again . ] None of the other servants came in after we left ? MARTIN . No , madam . MRS. WESTERN . You 're sure ? MARTIN . Quite sure , madam . They were all downstairs , having their supper . MRS. WESTERN . Most mysterious ! Incomprehensible ! JUDGE . [ Looking at his watch . ] Past nine ! We shall plunge into the play — like body-snatchers , looking for the corpse of the plot — and we shall never know what it was that the heroine did . MRS. WESTERN . [ Ignoring him , to MARTIN . ] Smithers I 'll answer for . MARTIN . Oh yes , madam . If I might make a suggestion — MRS. WESTERN . Well ? MARTIN . It could n't have fallen anywhere into your dress , madam ? MRS. WESTERN . Nonsense , how could it ? [ She gets up and shakes herself . ] Absurd . [ She sits again . MARTIN . Into your cloak ? MRS. WESTERN . Silk ! No . That 'll do , Martin . You might help the others outside . [ MARTIN goes . JUDGE . [ With a step forward . ] Now , admirable sister — MRS. WESTERN . Did n't it strike you that Martin 's manner was rather strange ? HARVEY . [ Fretfully . ] Really you must not suspect the servants ! MRS. WESTERN . [ Turning to him . ] Must not — must ! That 's scarcely the way to speak to me , Harvey . HARVEY . [ Deprecatingly . ] My dear — MRS. WESTERN . And I was n't suspecting — I was merely asking a question of my brother . JUDGE . Come , Alice , let 's go . MRS. WESTERN . [ Shaking her head . ] You three go . You 'll excuse me . JUDGE . [ Cheerfully . ] If you insist — MRS. BANKET . [ Coming forward . ] No , no . Do come , Alice ! MRS. WESTERN . I can n't — I 'm so puzzled . [ With a sudden idea . ] Oh ! HARVEY . [ Who is behind her to the left , between her and the JUDGE . ] What ? Have you found it ? MRS. WESTERN . No , no — of course not . But ring , please , will you ? HARVEY . Why ? MRS. WESTERN , I want you to ring . [ He presses the bell by the fireplace . ] I just remember Miss Farren came in while we were having coffee . HARVEY . [ Indignantly . ] Alice ! MRS. WESTERN . I asked her to write a card to Harrod 's — she 'll have written it in here . HARVEY . [ Angrily . ] I say — really ! MRS. WESTERN . [ Coldly . ] No need to snub me again — before our guests ! I need scarcely say I am not suspecting Miss Farren — but in justice to her — MRS. BANKET . But , Alice , she 'll have gone out — you told her she might — MRS. WESTERN . Only to her sister 's close by — and she may not have gone yet . Why do n't they answer the bell ? Ring again , Harvey . JUDGE . The poor things are still searching . HARVEY . [ Firmly . ] Alice , I protest , I do indeed — MRS. WESTERN . Do n't be so foolishly sentimental — it 's ridiculous at your age . The young woman is in my employ , as governess to my children . [ MARTIN comes in . ] Has Miss Farren gone out yet ? MARTIN . No , madam . I believe she 's in her room , dressing . MRS. WESTERN . Ask her to come . MARTIN . Yes , madam . [ He goes . JUDGE . [ Shaking his head . ] No sense of proportion , that 's the truth — they 've no sense of proportion . MRS. BANKET . Tom ! JUDGE . A fact , my dear — but you can n't help it . You 've every quality in the world but just that — you will always look through the wrong end of the telescope . MRS. BANKET . Really , Tom , this is n't the moment for your nonsense — and if you only knew how stupid you are when you try to be funny ! HARVEY . [ Going nervously to MRS . WESTERN . ] I say , I really do think — MRS. WESTERN . [ Roughly . ] I do n't care what you think . Leave me alone ! [ There is silence . The JUDGE , sitting by the fire , whistles loudly “ Waltz me around again , Willie ! ” HARVEY has gone moodily across the room and stands by the sideboard . MRS. BANKET is sitting behind the table . After a moment the door opens , and MISS FARREN comes in , with hat and cloak on , and goes straight to MRS. WESTERN . She is an extremely pretty girl of twenty . MISS FARREN . You want me , Mrs. Western ? MRS. WESTERN . Oh , Miss Farren , I 've lost my bracelet . MISS FARREN . Really ! I 'm so sorry ! Where ? MRS. WESTERN . I do n't know . You did n't see it , of course , after we 'd gone ? MISS FARREN . [ Shaking her head . ] No — and no one came in . I was writing the letter to Harrod 's . MRS. WESTERN . No one at all ? MISS FARREN . No — I 'm sure of that . And I 'd hardly got to my room when I heard the car come back . MRS. WESTERN . Well , thank you , Miss Farren . MISS FARREN . It 's very annoying . You 're sure it 's not in the car ? JUDGE . My dear Miss Farren , it 's not in the car , it 's not anywhere , and I 'm beginning to believe it never was at all . Come , Alice , let 's go . We sha n't see much of the play , but we can at least help the British drama by buying two programmes . MISS FARREN . [ With a light laugh — then turning to MRS. WESTERN again . ] Do you want me any more , Mrs. Western ? MRS. WESTERN . No , thanks . [ MISS FARREN turns to go — MRS. WESTERN , who has suddenly cast an eager glance at her , as though attracted by something , calls her back . ] Oh , Miss Farren ! MISS FARREN . [ Turning . ] Yes ? MRS. WESTERN . I wonder whether you 'd be so good as to shift this aigrette of mine — it 's hurting me . MISS FARREN . Certainly . [ She comes back to MRS. WESTERN , and stands by her side ; as she raises her arm MRS. WESTERN jumps up and seizes it by the wrist . MRS. WESTERN . My bracelet ! [ Keeping a tight hold of MISS FARREN 'S wrist , she holds it at arm 's length . There is a general cry of amazement — the JUDGE and his wife start to their feet — HARVEY rushes eagerly towards her . JUDGE . Alice ! MRS. BANKET . Oh ! HARVEY . No , no — [ These three exclamations are simultaneous . MRS. WESTERN . There it is ! She took it ! JUDGE . Are you sure ? HARVEY . [ Breathless and urgent . ] Alice — MISS FARREN . [ Recovering from her shock and bewilderment . ] Mrs. Western , it is n't — MRS. WESTERN . [ Sternly , still holding the girl by the wrist . ] You dare to pretend — HARVEY . [ Who is now at the back of his wife 's chair , looking closely at the bracelet . ] Let me look , let me look .... I say , Alice , you 're wrong . It 's not yours at all . The setting 's different . MRS. WESTERN . [ Angrily . ] What do you mean , different ? You think I do n't know my own bracelet ? Are you mad ? I say it 's mine — and it is ! JUDGE . [ Stepping forward . ] Alice , be careful — MRS. WESTERN . Careful ! You 're as bad as he ! Of course the thing 's mine — I 've been wearing it for weeks — and you think I can make a mistake ? She found it , and took it . MISS FARREN . [ Very distressed . ] No , no , Mrs. Western , really ! It is n't yours ! I assure you ! HARVEY . Alice , I declare to you — MRS. WESTERN . [ Roughly . ] Be quiet and go away . This is no business of yours . HARVEY . [ Eagerly . ] But it is ! It was I who bought the wretched thing — well , I am prepared to swear that this is n't the one ! MRS. WESTERN . [ A little shaken , looking at it again . ] You 're prepared to .... [ She lifts her head . ] How can you talk such utter nonsense ? There is not the least doubt — not the least ! JUDGE . [ Stopping HARVEY , who is about to protest violently . ] Alice , mind what you 're saying . You 'll get yourself into trouble . If Harvey says — MRS. BANKET . [ Contemptuously . ] He 's saying it to shield her , that 's all . HARVEY . [ Indignantly . ] I 'm not . It 's not true . But you must n't bring such an accusation . It 's monstrous . And I wo n't allow — MRS. WESTERN . [ Drawing herself up . ] You — wo n't — allow ! The girl takes my bracelet — and you wo n't allow ! Miss FARREN . [ Trying to free herself . ] Mrs. Western , I have n't , I have n't ! JUDGE . [ Impressively . ] Alice , will you listen to me ? MRS. WESTERN . No , I wo n't ! This does n't concern you , or any one , but me and this girl ! Look at her — she knows ! MISS FARREN . Mrs. Western , you 're hurting my arm .... MRS. WESTERN . Come now — confess ! I wo n't be hard on you if you confess — [ She wrenches off the bracelet , and releases the girl , who staggers back , nursing her wrist . HARVEY . [ Almost beside himself , stamping his foot . ] Alice , Alice , will you hear — MISS FARREN . Oh , you have hurt me ! And you 've no right — to say such things .... HARVEY . No , you have n't , you have n't ! MRS. WESTERN . Besides , a bracelet like that ! [ She holds it up . To MISS FARREN . ] You wo n't confess ? Very well , then . I 'll send for a policeman . HARVEY . [ Doggedly . ] The bracelet is hers . MRS. WESTERN . [ Jeeringly . ] Turquoise and emeralds ! Hers ! A coincidence , perhaps . Very likely . I 'll give her in charge at once . HARVEY . The bracelet is hers , I tell you . MRS. WESTERN . [ Turning furiously on him . ] You dare to say that ? HARVEY . [ Steadily . ] Yes . Because I myself — gave it to her . [ There is a moment 's almost stupefied silence ; HARVEY and ALICE are face to face . MISS FARREN to the left of her , MRS. BANKET is still at the back , the JUDGE by the fire . MRS. WESTERN breaks the silence . MRS. WESTERN . [ Sternly . ] You — gave — it — her ? HARVEY . [ Steadily . ] Yes . MRS. WESTERN . You ask me to believe that you gave a bracelet to — this person — my children 's governess ? HARVEY . I did . MRS. WESTERN . An exact copy of the one you gave me ?</titlePart></docTitle>

     <set>
      <p>HARVEY . I 've told you — it 's not an exact copy — there 's a difference in the setting . MRS. BANKET . Nonsense , nonsense , it can n't be — he 's just saying this — JUDGE . Fanny , do n't interfere . HARVEY . I 'm saying what 's true . MRS. WESTERN . I refuse to believe it . It 's incredible . You 've not sunk so low as that . It 's a lie . HARVEY . [ Indignantly . ] Alice ! MRS. WESTERN . Yes , a lie . A trumped-up story . The girl has taken it — MISS FARREN . I have not ! MRS. WESTERN . You can tell that to the magistrate — [ She turns to HARVEY ] and you too , if you like . [ She moves to the bell . JUDGE . [ Putting out a hand to stop her . ] Alice — MRS. WESTERN . Leave me alone , Tom . I know what I 'm doing . I 'll send for a policeman . HARVEY . [ Imploringly . ] Alice , Alice — MRS. WESTERN . [ Pausing , with her hand on the bell . ] I 'll let the girl off , if you 'll tell me the truth . HARVEY . I have told you the truth . MRS. WESTERN . You persist in this silly falsehood ? HARVEY . It is n't — I tell you it is n't ! MRS. WESTERN . Very well , then . [ She presses the bell . At that moment the door bursts open , and MARTIN comes in triumphantly , with the bracelet on a salver . SMITHERS and WILLIAM are behind him , but do not pass beyond the threshold . MARTIN . [ Eagerly . ] Ma'am , ma'am , we 've found the — [ MRS. WESTERN has turned towards him , still holding the other bracelet in her hand . MARTIN catches sight of it , and stops dead short , staring bewilderedly at it . MRS. WESTERN . [ Calmly . ] Where did you find it ? [ She takes the bracelet off the salver and lays it on the table . MARTIN . [ With a great effort . ] It had fallen into the pocket of the car — there was a hole in the pocket — it had worked its way right down into the body . MRS. WESTERN . Very well . Thank you . [ MARTIN goes ; the other servants have already slunk off . There is a moment 's silence . MRS. WESTERN suddenly flings the bracelet she has in her hand in MISS FARREN 'S direction . MRS. WESTERN . [ Contemptuously . ] Here . I return you your property . And now pack up your things and leave the house . HARVEY . [ Who has stepped forward and picked up the bracelet , standing between MRS. WESTERN and MISS FARREN . ] No . MRS. WESTERN . [ Staring at him . ] What ? HARVEY . [ Violently . ] I say , No ! MRS. WESTERN . I have told the girl to leave my house . HARVEY . My house — mine ! And she shall stay in it ! Or , at least , when she goes , it shall be without the slightest stain or suspicion — MRS. WESTERN . [ Scornfully . ] I am not accusing her of theft . HARVEY . But you are insinuating — I declare solemnly before you all — JUDGE . [ Interposing . ] Harvey , one moment .... I am sure that Miss Farren would rather go to her room .... MISS FARREN . Yes . HARVEY . By all means . Here , take your bracelet . [ He gives it to her . ] But you do n't leave this house — you understand that ? I am master here . [ MISS FARREN goes quietly . JUDGE . Now just listen to me , both of you . Be calm — all this excitement wo n't help . Harvey , you too . You and Alice will have your explanation — MRS. WESTERN . If the girl does n't go to-night — HARVEY . I tell you again she shall not ! And there 's no need . I was a fool to give her that bracelet — she did n't want to take it — MRS. BANKET . Why did you ? HARVEY . I had given Alice one on her birthday . MRS. WESTERN . Well ? HARVEY . And so I got her one . MRS. WESTERN . Why ? HARVEY . Because — [ He stops , very embarrassed . ] MRS. WESTERN . Well ? HARVEY . Because — oh , because — well , she admired it — and she liked pretty things too .... MRS. WESTERN . I do n't think you need say anything more . MRS. BANKET . No . He need n't . It 's clear enough ! HARVEY . [ Eagerly . ] Look here , on my honour — I am fond of her , of course , in a way — but I 'm old enough to be her father — and I swear to you all — I 've seen her about , of course , a good deal — and I gave her that thing — but beyond that , nothing , nothing ! MRS. WESTERN . [ Sitting , and with a shrug of the shoulder . ] A ridiculous fairy tale ! JUDGE . My dear Alice , take my advice , and believe your husband . MRS. WESTERN . You too ! MRS. BANKET . All alike , when there 's a pretty face ! JUDGE . Let her find another situation , by all means .... But to turn a girl out , at a moment 's notice ! You could n't . MRS. WESTERN . [ Turning to the JUDGE . ] You are really suggesting that I should sleep under the same roof with — JUDGE . [ Almost sternly . ] You are condemning , without the slightest evidence . And condemning , remember , an utterly defenceless creature . This girl has a claim on you : were your suspicions justified , she-would still have a claim . MRS. WESTERN . Indeed ! MRS. BANKET . The nonsense he talks ! It 's really too silly ! JUDGE . You are extraordinary , you women ! You exact such rigid morality from the governess and the housemaid ! You 're full of excuses when it 's one of yourselves ! MRS. BANKET . [ Indignantly . ] Tom ! JUDGE . Well , that 's true — we all know it ! And here — I believe every word Harvey has said . MRS. WESTERN . [ Scarcely believing her ears . ] You do ! JUDGE . Because he is a man of honour , and men of honour have their code . Their children 's governess ... is safe . You will do well to believe it , too . Now , Fanny , we 'll go . Be sensible , Alice — I tell you again , Harvey 's right ; the girl must not be — summarily dismissed : it would be an act of cruel injustice . Good-bye . [ He offers to kiss her — she turns away . ] As you like . Good-bye , Harvey , old man . HARVEY . Good-bye , Tom . [ They shake hands . ] And thank you . MRS. BANKET . [ Kissing MRS . WESTERN . ] My poor , dear Alice ! MRS. WESTERN . Good-bye , Fanny . I 'm sorry that our party to-night — MRS. BANKET . Oh , that does n't matter ! Poor thing ! I promise you that Tom shall have a good talking to ! [ She is too angry with HARVEY to say good-bye to him : she and the JUDGE go . The moment the door closes , HARVEY begins , feverishly and passionately . HARVEY . Now just listen . I 'm going to speak to you — I 'm going to say things — things that have been in my heart , in my life , for years . I 'm not going to spare you , I 'm going to tell you the truth , and the truth , and the truth ! MRS. WESTERN . [ Calmly , looking ironically at him . ] If it 's the same kind of truth you 've been giving us to-night — HARVEY . We 've been married ten years . Oh , I know , we were neither of us very young . But anyhow the last five have been nothing but misery for me . Misery — do you hear that ? You sitting there , calm and collected — not caring one damn for me — MRS. WESTERN . [ Quietly . ] That 's not true . HARVEY . It is , and you know it . The mother of my children ! Satisfied with that . Never a word of kindness , or sympathy . And as for — affection ! MRS. WESTERN . We 're not sweethearts — we 're middle-aged people . HARVEY . Well , I need something more . And , look here , I 'll tell you . This girl has made life worth living . That 's all . I 'd come home at night dog-tired , all day in the City — sick of it , Stock Exchange , office , and the mud and the grime and the worry — there were you , with a nod , ah , Harvey , good evening — and you 'd scarcely look up from your Committee Report or your Blue-book , or damned pamphlet or other — MRS. WESTERN . [ Contemptuously . ] You are one of the men who want their wife to be a mere sort of doll . HARVEY . [ More and more vehemently . ] I want my wife to care for me ! I want her to smile when I come in , and be glad — I want her to love me ! You do n't ! By the Lord , I 've sneaked upstairs , gone in and had a peep at the children — well , they 'd be asleep . I tell you I 've been hungry , hungry , for a word , for a look ! And there , in the schoolroom , was this girl . I 've played it low down , I know — she 's fond of me . But I could n't help it — I was lonely — that 's what it was . I 've gone up there night after night . You did n't know where I was — and you did n't care . In my study , you thought — the cold , chilly box that you call my study — glad to have me out of the way . Well , there I was , with this girl . It was something to look forward to , in the cab , coming home . It was something to catch hold of , when things went wrong , in that dreary grind of money-making . Her eyes lit up when they saw me . She 'd ask me about things — if I coughed , she 'd fuss me — she had pretty ways , and was pleased , oh , pleased beyond words , if I brought her home something — MRS. WESTERN . So this is n't the first time ! HARVEY . [ With a snarl . ] No , of course not ! She admired that bracelet of yours — by Jove , I said to myself , I 'll get her one like it ! Whatever I brought home to you you 'd scarcely say thank you — and usually it went into the drawer — I 'd such shocking bad taste ! She 'd beam ! Well , as ill-luck would have it , you took a fancy to this one . I told her she must n't wear hers — MRS. WESTERN . [ Calmly and cuttingly . ] Conspiring behind my back . HARVEY . [ Raging . ] Oh , if you knew what has gone on behind your back ! Not when I was with her — when I was alone ! The things I 've said about you — to myself ! When I thought of this miserable life that had to be dragged on here , thought of your superior smile , your damnable cruelty — MRS. WESTERN . [ Genuinely surprised . ] Cruelty ! Why ? HARVEY . What else ? I 'd go up to you timidly — bah , why talk of it ? To you I 've been the machine that made money — money to pay for the house , and the car , and the dressmakers ’ bills — a machine that had to be fed — and when you 'd done that , you 'd done all . Well , there was this girl — MRS. WESTERN . You had your children . HARVEY . A boy of seven and a girl of five — in bed when I came home — and your children much more than mine — I 'm a stranger to them ! And anyhow , I wanted something more — something human , alive — that only a woman can give . And she gave it . Nothing between us , I swear — but just that . As Tom says , I 've not been such a cur — and you ought to know me well enough , after all these years !... But there is the truth — she 's fond of me : she is , it 's a fact . And I needed that fondness — it has kept me going . And now — do you think I 'll let her be thrust out into the street ? [ As he says these last words he drops into a chair , facing her , and looks fiercely and doggedly at her . MRS. WESTERN . [ Calmly . ] Stop now , and listen to me . I 've let you rattle on . Will you hear me for one moment ? HARVEY . Go on . MRS. WESTERN . All those things you 've said about me — [ With a shrug . ] Well , what 's the use ? I suppose we 're like most married people when they come to our age . I 've interests of my own , that do n't appeal to you — HARVEY . Blue-books and Committees ! MRS. WESTERN . I do useful work — oh yes , you may sneer — you always have sneered ! If a woman tries to do something sensible with her life , instead of cuddling and kissing you all day , she 's cold and cruel . We 've drifted apart — well , your fault as much as mine . More , perhaps — but it 's no good going into that — no good making reproaches . That 's how things are — we must make the best of them . Wait , let me finish . About this girl . Granted that what you say is true — and I 'm inclined to believe it — HARVEY . [ Genuinely grateful . ] At least thank you for that ! MRS. WESTERN . Or at any rate it 's better policy to believe it , for every one 's sake — HARVEY . [ Bitterly . ] That 's right — that 's more like you ! MRS. WESTERN . We gain nothing by abusing each other . And I did n't interrupt you . Let 's look facts in the face . Here we are , we two — tied . HARVEY . [ With a groan . ] Yes . MRS. WESTERN . With our two children . If it were n't for them .... Well , we 've got to remain together . Now there 's this girl . It 's quite evident , after what you 've said , that she can n't stop here — HARVEY . [ Jumping to his feet . ] She shall ! MRS. WESTERN . [ Fretfully . ] Oh , do be a man , and drop this mawkish sentiment ! You say she 's fond of you — you 've made her fond of you . Was this a very pretty thing — for a man of your age to do ? HARVEY . [ Sullenly , as he drops back into his chair . ] Never mind my age . MRS. WESTERN . Very well then — for a married man ? HARVEY . An unhappy man . MRS. WESTERN . Even granting that — though if you 're unhappy it 's your own fault — I 've always been urging you to go on the County Council — What 's to become of the girl , if she stops here ? HARVEY . [ Desperately . ] I do n't know — but I can n't let her go — I tell you I can n't ! MRS. WESTERN . [ Scarcely able to conceal her disgust . ] Oh , if you knew how painful it is to hear you whining like this ! It 's pitiable , really ! In the girl 's own interest — how can she stop ? HARVEY . She must . I can n't let her be turned out . It would break her heart . MRS. WESTERN . [ Turning right round , and staring at him . ] What ? HARVEY . [ Doggedly . ] Yes — it would . She 's very fond of me , that 's the truth . I know that I 've been to blame — but it 's too late for that now . She 's romantic , of course — what you 'd call sentimental . I dare say I 've played on her feelings — she saw I was lonely . She has a side that you 've never suspected — a tender , sensitive side — she has ideals .... Well , do you realise what it would mean , with a girl like that ? No one knows her as I do . I 'm quite startled sometimes , to find how fond she is of me . Oh , have some sympathy ! It 's difficult , I know — it 's terribly difficult . But she loves me — that 's the truth — and a young girl 's love — why , she might throw herself into the river ! Oh yes , you smile — but she might ! What do you know of life , with your Blue-books ? Anyhow , I dare n't risk it . By-and-by — there 's no hurry , is there ? And I put it to you — be merciful ! You 're not the ordinary woman — you have a brain — you 're not conventional . Do n't act like the others . Do n't drive this girl out of the house . It would end in tragedy . Believe it ! MRS. WESTERN . You can n't really expect me to keep a girl here , as governess to my children , who , as you say , is in love with you . HARVEY . [ Pleading . ] I expect you — I 'm asking you — to help her — and me . MRS. WESTERN . [ Shaking her head . ] That 's too much . We wo n't turn her out to-night — I 'll give her a reference , and all that — HARVEY . [ Springing to his feet again . ] Alice , I can n't let her go ! MRS. WESTERN . [ Conciliatorily . ] Ask Tom , ask any one — HARVEY . [ More and more passionately . ] I tell you , I can n't let her go ! MRS. WESTERN . Be sensible , Harvey — you must realise yourself there 's no alternative — HARVEY . [ With a violent and uncontrollable outburst . ] I vow and declare to you — if she goes , I go too ! And the consequences will be on your head ! [ MRS. WESTERN has also risen — they stand face to face , looking at each other — and for a moment there is silence . The door opens , and MISS FARREN comes in , dressed as before . She walks straight to MRS. WESTERN . MISS FARREN . Mrs. Western , my things are packed , and on the cab — HARVEY . [ Wildly . ] My poor child , you 're not to go — I told you . MISS FARREN . [ With a demure glance at him , stopping him as he is moving towards her . ] Of course I must — I can n't stay here — that 's not possible . My sister will take me in for to-night . MRS. WESTERN . Miss Farren , my husband has explained to me — I withdraw all — MISS FARREN . [ Carelessly . ] Oh , that 's all right — though thank you all the same . And it really does n't matter much . I was going to give notice to-morrow anyway — HARVEY . [ Starting violently . ] What ! MISS FARREN . Well , I put it off as long as I could , Mr. Western , because ... But the fact is I 'm going on the stage — musical comedy — HARVEY . [ Breathless , staggering back . ] You — are — going — MISS FARREN . I 've accepted an engagement — oh , I 'm only to be a show-girl at first — but they believe I 'll do well . They 've been wanting me some time . And my fiancé has persuaded me . HARVEY . [ Collapsing utterly , dropping into the chair by the fire . ] Your — MISS FARREN . [ Gravely . ] My fiancé — yes . He 's one of the comic men there . MRS. WESTERN . [ Who has been watching them both with an unmoved face . ] I 'll write a cheque for your salary , Miss Farren . [ She goes to the desk at back . MISS FARREN . [ Coquettishly , to HARVEY . ] I ought to have told you , I know , Mr. Western . But it was so dull here — and you 've been most awfully good to me . I can never be sufficiently grateful . HARVEY . [ With difficulty , his face turned away . ] Do n't mention it . And I hope you 'll be happy . MISS FARREN . [ Lightly . ] Thank you . I mean to try ! [ MRS. WESTERN returns with a cheque which she hands to MISS FARREN . MRS. WESTERN . Here , Miss Farren . MISS FARREN . [ Putting it into her bag . ] Thank you so much . Good-bye . MRS. WESTERN . If you should ever need a reference , do n't be afraid to — MISS FARREN . Oh , thanks , no more governessing for me . Good-bye ! [ She trips out , without another glance at HARVEY , who sits huddled by the fire . MRS. WESTERN moves slowly to the door . At the threshold she pauses , turns , and looks at HARVEY . MRS. WESTERN . I 'll take care that the next governess — shall be quite as pretty as this one , Harvey . [ She opens the door and goes . HARVEY does n't stir .</p>
