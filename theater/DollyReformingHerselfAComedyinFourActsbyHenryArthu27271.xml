    <docTitle><titlePart>“ This new play , by Mr. Henry Arthur Jones , at The Haymarket , is surely as good a comedy as he has ever written . I should say , in evaluating Mr. Jones , that his greatest asset is his humor . We are grateful that Mr. Jones has that comfortable gift which prevents him from dancing on us — that gift of humor whereby he is content to take us just as we are . No playwright is more joyously observant than Mr. Jones ; and none observes more accurately , in the milieu that he has chosen . Other playwrights may create more salient and memorable figures . But none of them creates figures so lifelike as Mr. Jones . Nor is any one of them so fine a craftsman . We are not made conscious of it while the play is in progress . From the very outset , we are aware merely of certain ladies and gentlemen behaving with apparent freedom and naturalness . It is only when the play is over that we notice the art of it . The verisimilitude of “ Dolly Reforming Herself ” is all the more admirable because the play is founded on a philosophic question , and in the whole course of it there is not a scene , not a character ( not even the butler 's character ) , that is not strictly and logically relevant to this question . The whole fabric is wrought in a tight and formal pattern , yet the effect of it is as life itself . The question in point is “ Can we cure ourselves of our bad habits ? ” and the answer is worked not through a story , but simply through the behavior of a few people in a country-house . The central scene of the play , however , is the scene between Dolly and her husband . The whole scene is delightful , worked out with the finest sense of dramatic rhythm : a truly great comic scene , of which Mr. Jones may well be proud . ” Mr. Max Beerbohm — The Saturday Review .</titlePart></docTitle>

   <head>ACT I .</head>
   <stage>SCENE : Drawing-room at HARRY TELFER 'S , The Gables , Crookbury Green , Surrey . A well-furnished room in a modern red brick country house . At the back , a little to the right , is a door leading into the hall . All along the right side is a glass partition , showing a conservatory which is entered by glass doors , one up stage , the other down . On the left side is a large fireplace . At the back , in the centre , is a handsome writing-desk with a shut down flap lid . Above the fireplace , facing the audience is a large sofa . To the right of sofa , and below it in the left centre of the room is a small table , and near to it an easy chair . Right centre down stage is a larger table .</stage>
   <stage>TIME : The afternoon of 1ST January , 1907 .</stage>
   <stage>Discover at writing-table , back to audience , DOLLY TELFER , a bright little woman about thirty , busied with bills and papers . Bending over her , back to audience , is her father , MATT BARRON , a pleasant-looking , easy-going cynic of sixty . HARRY TELFER , DOLLY 'S husband , an ordinary good-natured , weakish , impulsive Englishman about thirty-five , is standing with his back to the fire . Sitting on sofa , reading a scientific book , is PROFESSOR STURGESS , a hard , dry , narrow , fattish scientific man about forty-five . At the table , right , reading a French novel , is RENIE STURGESS , the Professor 's wife , a tall , dark , handsome woman about thirty .</stage>
   <stage>Harry . No , I can n't say that I pay very much attention to sermons as a rule , but Pilcher gave us a regular downright , no-mistake-about-it , rouser at the Watch-night Service last night .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . [ Turning round . ] I wonder what precise difference this rousing sermon will make in the conduct of any person who heard it .</stage>
   <stage>Harry . Well , it 's going to make a lot of difference in my conduct . At least , I wo n't say a lot of difference , because I do n't call myself a very bad sort of fellow , do you ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . N-o — No ——</stage>
   <stage>Harry . At any rate I 'm a thundering good husband , ai n't I , Dolly ? [ DOLLY takes no notice . ] And I 've got no flagrant vices . But I 've got a heap of — well a heap of selfish little habits , such as temper , and so on , and for the coming year I 'm going to knock them all off .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . That will be a score for Pilcher — that is , if you do knock them off .</stage>
   <stage>Harry . Oh , I 'm thoroughly resolved ! I promised Dolly last night , did n't I , Dolly ? [ DOLLY takes no notice . ] Dolly too ! Dolly was awfully impressed by the sermon , were n't you , Dolly ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . [ Looking round at DOLLY 'S back . ] Dolly was awfully impressed ?</stage>
   <stage>Harry . Yes . Before we went to bed she gave me her word , that if I 'd give her a little help , she 'd pay off all her bills , and live within her allowance for the future , did n't you , Dolly ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Well , that will be another score for Pilcher — that is , if Dolly does live within her allowance .</stage>
   <stage>Harry . Oh , Dolly means it this time , do n't you Dolly ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Turns round on her stool , bills in hand . ] I think it 's disgraceful !</stage>
   <stage>Matt . What ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . These tradespeople ! [ Comes down to MATT . ] I 'm almost sure I 've paid this bill once — if not twice . Then there 's a mistake of thirty shillings in the addition — you 're good at figures , Dad . Do add that up for me . My head is so muddled .</stage>
   <stage>[ Giving the bill to MATT .</stage>
   <stage>Harry . Are n't you glad , Doll , that you made that resolution not to have any more bills ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . It will be heavenly ! To go about all day with the blessed thought that I do n't owe a farthing to anybody . It 's awful !</stage>
   <stage>[ Crunching a bill in her hand , and throwing it on to writing-table .</stage>
   <stage>Harry . Cheer up , little woman ! You do n't owe such a very alarming amount , do you ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Oh no ! Oh no ! And if you 'll only help me as you promised ——</stage>
   <stage>Harry . We 'll go thoroughly into it by-and-by . In fact I did mean to give you a pleasant little Christmas surprise , and pay off all your debts .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Oh , you angel ! But why did n't you do it ?</stage>
   <stage>Harry . I 've done it so often ! You remember the last time ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Making a wry face . ] Yes , I remember the last time .</stage>
   <stage>Harry . And here we are again !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Oh , do n't talk like a clown !</stage>
   <stage>Harry . But , my dear Dolly , here we are again .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Well , I have n't got the money sense ! I simply have n't got it ! I was born without it !</stage>
   <stage>Matt . [ Hands her the bill . ] The addition is quite correct .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Taking the bill . ] You 're sure ? Then I 'm convinced I 've paid it ! [ Looking at bill . ] Yes ! Thirty-four , seven , six . Professor Sturgess ——</stage>
   <stage>Prof. [ Looks up from his book ] Yes ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . You understand all about psychology and the way our brains work .</stage>
   <stage>Prof . I 've given my entire life to their study , but I cannot claim that I understand them .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . But would n't you say ——</stage>
   <stage>Prof. What ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . I 'm morally certain I 've paid this bill .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Have you got the receipt ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . No ! I must have mislaid it .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . When , and where did you pay it ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . I cannot recall the exact circumstances . And now ——</stage>
   <stage>Matt . And now ——?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Fulks and Garner have sent me a most impertinent note requesting immediate payment .</stage>
   <stage>Prof. What is the particular brain process that you wish me to explain ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . How do you account for my having the most vivid impression that I 've paid it — so vivid that I cannot shake it off ?</stage>
   <stage>Prof. Well — a ——</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Is n't it an instance of that obscure operation of the feminine mind whereby the merest wish becomes an accomplished fact ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . My dear Dad , I actually remember the exact amount : thirty-four , seven , six . Thirty-four , seven , six . I shall never enter Fulks and Garnet 's shop again !</stage>
   <stage>Enter CRIDDLE . [ Announces . ] Captain Wentworth !</stage>
   <stage>Enter CAPTAIN LUCAS WENTWORTH , a good-looking smart young army man about thirty . He is in riding-clothes . Exit CRIDDLE . At CAPTAIN WENTWORTH 'S entrance RENIE shows keen interest , throws him a secret glance as he goes to shake hands with DOLLY .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Ah , Lu ! What , over again ! Happy New Year once more !</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Same to you . [ Shaking hands . ] Happy New Year , everybody ! Good afternoon , Harry !</stage>
   <stage>[ Nodding to HARRY .</stage>
   <stage>Harry . Ditto , Lu .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Ah , Uncle Matt ! Happy New Year !</stage>
   <stage>[ Shaking hands .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Happy New Year , Lucas !</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Good afternoon , Mrs. Sturgess .</stage>
   <stage>[ Shaking hands with RENIE .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Good afternoon .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . None the worse for your outing last night , I hope ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Oh no , I 'm sure Mr. Pilcher 's sermon ought to make us all very much better .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . May I introduce you to Professor Sturgess — my cousin Captain Wentworth .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . How d'ye do ?</stage>
   <stage>Prof. How d'ye do ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . So you came over to the Watch-night Service , I hear ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Yes ! I 'd nothing much better to do , and Dolly was cracking up this new parson of yours , so I thought I 'd jog over and sample him .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . A dozen miles over here at midnight ; an hour 's service in a cold church ; and a dozen miles back to Aldershot , in the sleet and snow . I hope the sermon thoroughly braced you up !</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . It did . It made me feel just as good as I knew how to be .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Here 's another score for Pilcher !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Dad , I think it 's shocking bad taste of you to keep on sneering at Mr. Pilcher !</stage>
   <stage>Matt . I 'm not sneering . I 'm only curious to follow up this wonderful sermon , and trace its results on all of you .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Well , you can see its results . [ LUCAS has got near to RENIE , stands with his back to her , takes out a letter from his coat-tail pocket , holds it out for her to take . She takes it , pops it in her novel , and goes on reading . He moves away from her . ] Take only our own family . Harry and I both have turned over a new leaf . Renie , you said Mr. Pilcher had set you thinking deeply ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Yes , dear , very deeply .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Lu , you said the sermon had done you a lot of good .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Heaps ! I wo n't say I 'm going to set up for a saint straight off , because — well — I 'm not so sure I could bring it off , even if I tried ——</stage>
   <stage>Matt . That 's what holds me back , my wretched nervous fear that I should n't bring it off . Still , in justice to Pilcher , I hope you 're not going to let his sermon be wasted .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Oh , no ! My first spare five minutes I 'm going to brisk about , and do a bit of New Year 's tidying up .</stage>
   <stage>[ He is standing over RENIE , who has opened his letter in her novel ; he again exchanges a secret look of understanding with her , and makes a sign to her to go into the conservatory .</stage>
   <stage>Enter CRIDDLE .</stage>
   <stage>Criddle . [ Announcing . ] Mr. Pilcher !</stage>
   <stage>Enter the REVEREND JAMES PILCHER , a big , strong , bright , genial , manly , hearty English parson about forty . Exit CRIDDLE .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . How d'ye do ? [ Shaking hands .</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . How d'ye do ? Happy New Year , once more ! Happy New Year , Mr. Barron !</stage>
   <stage>Matt . [ Shaking hands . ] A happy New Year .</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . How do again , Telfer ?</stage>
   <stage>Harry . How are you ?</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . Good morning , Mrs. Sturgess .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Good morning .</stage>
   <stage>[ At PILCHER 'S entrance she has hidden her French novel behind her in the chair . In shaking hands with PILCHER it drops on to the floor and LUCAS 'S letter drops out . LUCAS goes to pick it up , MR. PILCHER is before him , picks up the novel and letter and hands them to RENIE . In taking them she shows some confusion .</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . [ Genially . ] Improving the New Year by getting a thorough knowledge of Parisian life and manners , I see .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . [ Confused . ] No !— I had begun the book a week ago and so I thought — a — I 'd better finish it .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Good morning , Mr. Pilcher .</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . [ Shaking hands . ] Good morning .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Rattling good sermon you gave us last night .</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . I 'm glad you thought it worth coming so far to hear .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Not at all . Jolly well worth coming for , eh , Mrs. Sturgess ?</stage>
   <stage>[ With a sly little look and shake of the head at RENIE .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . I thoroughly enjoyed it !</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . [ A little surprised . ] Enjoyed it ! Now I meant to make you all very uncomfortable !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Oh , you gave us a good shaking up , and we deserved it ! I do n't think you 've met Professor Sturgess ?</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . [ Advancing to PROFESSOR . ] No , but I 've read his book , “ Man , the Automaton . ”</stage>
   <stage>Prof . [ Bowing . ] Not with disapproval , I trust ?</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . [ Shaking hands very cordially . ] With the most profound disapproval , with boundless , uncompromising dissent and antagonism !</stage>
   <stage>Prof . I 'm sorry !</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . Why , you deny that man has any vestige of free will .</stage>
   <stage>Prof . Certainly . The longer I live , the more I 'm convinced that free will is a purely subjective illusion .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Do you mean that when I will to do a certain thing I can n't do it ? Oh , that 's absurd . For instance , I will to go and touch that chair ! [ She goes and touches it . ] There ! [ Triumphantly . ] I 've done it ! That shows I 've got free will . [ The PROFESSOR shakes his head . ] Well , then how did I do it ?</stage>
   <stage>Prof . I affirm that your willing to touch that chair or not to touch it , your actual touching it , or not touching it ; your possession or non-possession of a criminal impulse ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . I have n't any criminal impulses ——</stage>
   <stage>Prof. [ Shakes his head and goes on . ] Your yielding to that criminal impulse or your not yielding to it — all these states of consciousness are entirely dependent upon the condition , quantity and arrangement of certain atoms in the gray matter of your brain . You think , you will , you act according as that gray matter works . You did not cause or make that condition of the atoms of your gray matter , therefore you are not responsible for thinking or acting in this way or that , seeing that your thoughts , and your actions , and that direction of your impulses which you call your will , are all precisely determined and regulated by the condition and arrangement of these minute atoms of your gray matter !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Has at first listened with great attention , but has grown bewildered as the PROFESSOR goes on . ] I do n't care anything about my gray matter ! I 've quite made up my mind I wo n't have any more bills !</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . [ Turning to RENIE . ] Does Mrs. Sturgess agree with the Professor 's doctrine ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . No , indeed ! To say that we 're mere machines — it 's horrid .</stage>
   <stage>Prof . The question is not whether it 's horrid , but whether it 's true .</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . What do you think , Mr. Barron ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . It 's a very nutty and knotty problem . I 'm watching to see Dolly and Harry solve it !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . See us solve it ! How ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . You and Harry heard a most thrilling , soul-stirring sermon last night .</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . You had good hearsay accounts of my sermon ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Excellent ! I should have heard it myself , but I 've reached an age when it would be dangerous to give up any of my old and cherished bad habits . So in place of going to church and selfishly reforming myself , I shall have to be content with watching Dolly and Harry reform themselves .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Do n't take any notice of him , Mr. Pilcher , he 's the most cynical , hardened reprobate ! I have to blush for him a hundred times a day .</stage>
   <stage>[ RENIE strolls casually into conservatory by lower door . LUCAS casually follows her .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . And in order to settle once and for all this vexed question of free will and moral responsibility , I 'll bet you , Harry , a simple fiver , and I 'll bet you Dolly , a new Parisian hat , and half a dozen pairs of gloves that you wo n't live up to your good resolutions , and that on next New Year 's Day you 'll neither of you be one ha'penny the better for all the wise counsels Mr. Pilcher gave you last night .</stage>
   <stage>Harry . A fiver ! Done !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . I 'll take you , too ! In fact , I 'll double it ; two new Parisian hats , and a dozen pairs of gloves !</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Done , my dear !</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . I hope I sha'n ' t be accused of talking shop if I venture to recall that betting was one of the bad habits I especially warned my congregation against , last night !</stage>
   <stage>Harry . By Jove , yes — I 'd forgotten all about that ! Of course , if you wish us to cry off ——</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . Well , not exactly . I might perhaps suggest an alternative plan which was tried with great success in my late parish ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . What was that ?</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . A very capital good fellow — an auctioneer and land surveyor , my churchwarden in fact , by name Jobling — found that in spite of constant good resolutions , certain small vices were gradually creeping upon him . There was an occasional outburst of temper to his clerks , an occasional half glass too much ; and on one lamentable market day , he actually discovered himself using bad language to Mrs. Jobling ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Looking at HARRY . ] Oh ! Ah !</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Jobling 's gray matter can n't have been in good working order .</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . We corrected that ! We got his gray matter under control .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . How ?</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . My Christmas Blanket Club happened to be on the road to bankruptcy . By the way , our Blanket Club here is in low water . Well , I gave Jobling a small box with a hole at the top sufficiently large to admit half a crown . And I suggested that whenever he was betrayed into one of these little slips , he should fine himself for the benefit of my Blanket Club ——</stage>
   <stage>Harry . Good business ! Dolly , where 's that collecting-box they sent us from the Hospital for Incurables ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . In the cupboard in the next room .</stage>
   <stage>Harry . Right-o ! No time like the present ! [ Exit . ]</stage>
   <stage>Matt . And how did you get out of this dilemma ?</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . Dilemma ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Did your Blanket Club remain in bankruptcy , or what must have been an even more distressing alternative to you , did Jobling continue to use bad language to his wife ?</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . We struck a happy medium . My Blanket Club balance was considerably augmented , and Jobling 's behaviour considerably improved under the stress of the fines .</stage>
   <stage>Re-enter HARRY with an old , dusty collecting-box on which is printed in large letters , “ County Hospital for Incurables . ”</stage>
   <stage>Harry . [ Placing the box on the table . ] There ! My name 's Jobling for the present ! By Jove ! that was a very neat idea of yours .</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . Ah , by the way , I did n't give you Jobling 's tariff ——</stage>
   <stage>Harry . Tariff ?</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . Jobling 's tariff for a mild little profanity like “ By Jove , ” was a mere sixpence .</stage>
   <stage>Harry . Oh ! [ Feels in his pocket .</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . Of course you need n't adopt Jobling 's scale .</stage>
   <stage>Harry . Oh yes ! I 'll toe the mark ! [ Takes six pence out of his pocket and puts it in his box . ] I 'm determined I 'll cure myself of all these bad little tricks ——</stage>
   <stage>Matt . [ To DOLLY , pointing to the money-box . ] Are you going to contribute ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Snappishly . ] Perhaps , when I 've paid off my bills .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . [ To PILCHER . ] Will you kindly let my daughter have your lowest tariff for ladies ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Oh , please do n't be in such a hurry . What about your own contribution ? Mr. Pilcher , I hope you do n't intend to let my father escape .</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . I understood Mr. Barron was prepared to risk a five-pound note that you and Mr. Telfer will not carry your New Year resolutions into practice ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . With the almost certain chance of drawing a five-pound note from Harry and a new hat from Dolly .</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . I 'm afraid I can n't hold out those inducements . But I can offer you the very pleasing alternatives of chuckling over your daughter 's and Mr. Telfer 's lapses , or of contributing five pounds to an excellent charity !</stage>
   <stage>Matt . H 'm ! Well I 'll do my best to oblige you , Mr. Pilcher ! Let me see !</stage>
   <stage>[ Looking round , his eye falls on RENIE and LUCAS who , at the beginning of the above conversation have gone into conservatory at lower door , and now come out again at upper door . She has a hot-house flower in her hand , and they are eagerly absorbed in their conversation . The PROFESSOR talking to HARRY and not noticing .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . [ Becoming aware that MATT is watching them . ] Yes , that arrangement of the stamens is quite unusual . It 's what the gardener calls a “ sport ” ——</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . [ Examining the flower . ] Jolly good sport , too !</stage>
   <stage>Matt . I 'm not sure that we have n't even better sport here ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . [ Coming to him . ] Sport ? What sport ? can we join ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . That 's just what I was going to propose . There are four of you here , who heard Mr. Pilcher 's excellent discourse last night . And you are all determined to turn over a new leaf this year . Is n't that so ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Yes !</stage>
   <stage>Harry . I know I am .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Mrs. Sturgess ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Yes , indeed !</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Lucas , you ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Yes , Uncle .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . On the first of January next , I am prepared to put a sovereign in that money-box for every one of you who can honestly declare that he has broken himself or herself of his bad habits during the year .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . I say , not all our bad habits ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . H 'm . I do n't wish to be exacting — I 've no doubt each of you has his own little failing or weakness . Well , come to me and say on your honour that you 've conquered this or that pet special weakness — and in goes my sovereign .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . You do n't really mean it ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Indeed I do . I hope you wo n't stand out and — spoil sport , eh ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Oh , I do n't mind coming in — just for the lark of the thing .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Then you all agree ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Oh yes .</stage>
   <stage>Harry . Certainly .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Mrs. Sturgess ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . We do n't know where we may be next Christmas .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . You 'll be here with us . I invite you on the spot . You accept ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Yes , delighted , if my husband ——</stage>
   <stage>Prof . Very pleased .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Well , Mr. Pilcher , I think I 've made your Blanket Club a very handsome offer .</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . Very handsome . [ Taking out watch . ] I hope our friends will cordially respond , for the sake of my Blanket Club .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . You 'll stay for a cup of tea ?</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . I 've heaps of New Year 's calls to make . I 'm afraid I must be going ; good afternoon , Professor !</stage>
   <stage>Prof. Good afternoon .</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . Good afternoon , Telfer .</stage>
   <stage>Harry . Good afternoon .</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . Good-bye , Mrs. Sturgess .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Good-bye . So many thanks for your eloquent sermon .</stage>
   <stage>[ Shaking hands .</stage>
   <stage>Pitcher . Now , was I eloquent ? I suppose I was , since I 've produced such an invigorating New Year atmosphere .</stage>
   <stage>[ RENIE moves her French novel .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . And brought Lucas over from Aldershot in the snow !</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Rather ! I shall come again next year .</stage>
   <stage>[ Shaking hands .</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . Do . And then we shall be able to estimate the effect of my eloquence .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . [ Tapping the money-box . ] We shall !</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . Good-bye , Mrs. Telfer .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Good-bye . [ Rings bell .</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . Good-bye , Mr. Barron .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Good-bye .</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . You might be inclined to risk a sovereign on yourself for the Blanket Club ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . I dare n't . I can n't trust my gray matter — I should make a dreadful fiasco .</stage>
   <stage>[ CRIDDLE appears at door .</stage>
   <stage>Pilcher . Mrs. Telfer , I leave him in your hands .</stage>
   <stage>[ Exit PILCHER . CRIDDLE closes the door after him .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Dolly , I do n't mind having that new Parisian hat on with you .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Done ! I do n't mind how much I punish you .</stage>
   <stage>Prof. [ Taking out his watch . ] Half past three , my dear .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . I do n't think I 'll go out this afternoon .</stage>
   <stage>Prof. Oh , you 'd better take your little constitutional . You missed it yesterday . I 'm sure your restlessness is due to your not taking regular exercise .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Which way are you going ? [ Yawning .</stage>
   <stage>Prof. My usual round , up to the White House and back by the fish-pond .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Perhaps I 'll join you at the fish-pond .</stage>
   <stage>Prof. [ To MATT . ] Nothing like living by rule and measure .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . I should n't wonder . I 've never tried it .</stage>
   <stage>Prof . I ascribe my constant good health and contentment to my unvarying routine of work and diet and exercise . [ Exit .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Then where do my constant good health and contentment come from ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Dolly , I left my evening kit here . Could you put me up for the night ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Delighted ! You 'll make up our rubber .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Right !</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Not going to ride back to Aldershot again to-night ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Not to-night , thank you .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Just a shade too bracing , eh ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Just a shade ! Dolly , I have n't seen your new fish-pond . Is anybody going to meet the Professor ?</stage>
   <stage>[ Glancing at RENIE .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . I am . [ Linking his arm in LUCAS 'S . ] We 'll get into an unvarying routine of exercise for the next hour . Come along !</stage>
   <stage>[ Takes LUCAS off as he is exchanging a look with RENIE . RENIE makes to follow them , stops at door , turns back a little , stops , takes out LUCAS 'S letter from her French novel , goes to fire and reads it . Meanwhile the following scene takes place between DOLLY and HARRY .</stage>
   <stage>Harry . [ To DOLLY . ] Now , Dolly , we can go through your bills .</stage>
   <stage>[ Going to her writing-desk .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Yes . Had n't I better sort them out first ?</stage>
   <stage>Harry . [ Taking up bills . ] Oh , I 'll help you sort them out ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Take care ! You 'll muddle all my papers . [ Taking bills out of his hands , and closing down the writing-desk . ] I want to have a little talk with Renie — you 'd better join them at the fish-pond .</stage>
   <stage>Harry . Well , so long as you do get them sorted , and squared up . What about after tea ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . All right . After tea .</stage>
   <stage>Harry . After tea . We 'll have a nice cosy half-hour , all to ourselves , and sweep them all out of our minds .</stage>
   <stage>[ With a gesture .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Nods cheerfully . ] Yes , a nice cosy half-hour and sweep them all out of our minds . [ With his gesture . Exit HARRY briskly . She repeats his gesture . ] Sweep them all out of our minds . [ Opening desk and regarding bills with dismay . ] Oh , do n't I wish I could ! Oh , Renie !</stage>
   <stage>[ RENIE is busy with her letter at the fire .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . [ Puts letter into pocket . ] What is it ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Has taken up one or two bills . ] These bills ! These awful bills ! These vampires !</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Yes , dear ! I suppose it 's rather dreadful , but it must be sweet to have a dear , kind husband who 'll pay them all off .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Harry ? He made a dreadful fuss last time . And then I did n't show him all .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Well , dear , after all , it 's only bills ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Only bills ! Only ? Well , I 'm going to show him every one this time . And what a lesson it shall be to me ! That 's why I 'm so grateful to Mr. Pilcher .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Why ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Yesterday afternoon I thought I 'd screw up my courage to go through the bills just to see where I was . My dear , I was paralysed ! I had the most appalling time ! Well , Mr. Pilcher 's sermon came just in the nick of time . I thought “ what an idiot I must be to endure all this misery just for want of a little resolution . ”</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Mr. Pilcher 's sermon came just in the nick of time for me too .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Did it ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . I had an awful afternoon yesterday !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . You ?! You have n't any bills ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . No ! [ Sighs . ] I almost wish I had .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Wish you had ? !</stage>
   <stage>Renie . I almost envy you the delicious experience of having to confess ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Yes dear , you always were fond of scenes , but I 'm not !</stage>
   <stage>Renie . And then the heavenly feeling of being forgiven , and taken in the arms of the man you love !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Yes , that part of it is all right . It 's what comes before ——</stage>
   <stage>[ With a little shudder .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . After all , your husband is n't a machine . He is a human being !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Oh , Harry 's a perfect dear in most things , but he has got a temper !</stage>
   <stage>Renie . My husband never even swears at me ! Oh , Dolly , you are lucky !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Hum !</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Oh , Dolly —— [ Sighs and goes away .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Is anything the matter ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . No dear . Nothing , except — oh , life is so hard ! so hard !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Renie , if you 're in trouble ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Thank you , dear . I knew you 'd help me .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Yes , so long as it is n't money . And even then I 'd help you , only I can n't .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . It is n't money .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Then what is it ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . [ Looking at DOLLY curiously . ] I wonder if you would understand .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . I 'll do my best .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . It 's such a strange story . [ Moving away , DOLLY makes a little dubious grimace behind her back . RENIE suddenly comes up to DOLLY very effusively . ] Dolly , I will trust you . You know I thoroughly admire and honour my husband .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ A little startled . ] Ye-es .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . You know that nothing could ever induce me to wrong him for a moment ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . No ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Nothing could be further from my thoughts .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . No — but is there anybody — Renie , who is it ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Give me your sacred promise you 'll never breathe a word to any living soul ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Not a word — who is it ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Not even to your husband ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Not even to my husband .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Nor to him ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Him ? No , of course not . Who is it ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Well , dear , you know what my life has been . Few women have met with so little real sympathy as I . Few women have suffered ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . No , dear . Who is it ? Do I know him ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Your cousin Lucas has a deep and sincere admiration for me .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Lu !? Lu !? Of course ! I might have known he 'd never ride a dozen miles in the snow for a sermon ! It 's disgraceful of him !</stage>
   <stage>Renie . No , dear , he 's not to blame . We are neither of us to blame .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Contemptuously . ] Oh ! Why you have n't known him a month , have you ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . I met him for the first time in this room three weeks ago last Thursday afternoon .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . It 's a great pity the Professor did n't come down with you .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . That would have made no difference . It had to be !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . What had to be ? Renie , how far has this gone ? You 've been meeting him alone ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Once or twice .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . You 've slipped away every afternoon this week .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . However often I may have met him , he has offered me nothing but the most chivalrous attention . He has always respected me ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Well then , he must n't respect you any more . It must be stopped .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Dolly , I did n't expect you to take up this attitude .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . You do n't suppose I 'm going to have this sort of thing in my own house , do you ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . What sort of thing ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Do you remember the awful row I got into at school when your boy 's love letter was discovered in the Banbury cakes you 'd persuaded me to take in for you ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . But you received Banbury cakes of your own !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Not since I 've been married . Of course before your marriage your outrageous flirting did n't much matter ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Outrageous flirting ?— If I seemed to flirt ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Seemed ? !</stage>
   <stage>Renie . It was only in the vain hope of meeting with one who could offer me the perfect homage that I have always felt would one day be mine .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Well , he must n't offer it here ! I shall tell him so very plainly . He 'd better not stay to dinner .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . There is no reason Captain Wentworth should not stay to dinner . He has given me the one absolutely blameless unselfish devotion of his life . I 've accepted it on that distinct understanding . I 've trusted you with my secret , a secret honourable alike to Captain Wentworth and myself . You 've promised not to breathe a word to any living soul . You surely do n't mean to break your word ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . I do n't mean to stand the racket of your Banbury cakes .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . I did n't expect you to be so unsympathetic . You promised to help me !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Help you ! How did you expect me to help you ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . My husband has to go to Edinburgh next week to give a course of lectures there .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Well ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . He wants me to go with him . Dearest , it would be perfectly sweet of you to ask me to stay on another fortnight here .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Makes a little movement of indignant surprise . ] I see !</stage>
   <stage>Renie . There could be no possible harm in it now that you know our attachment is quite innocent and that you can look after me every moment . Dearest , you might oblige me in a tiny little matter like this .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ After a pause . ] I 'll think it over ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Thank you so much .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Renie , you said Mr. Pilcher 's sermon came just in the nick of time ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . So it did .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . You do n't call this the “ nick of time ” ? !</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Yes , indeed . I went to church in a perfect fever . I did n't know what to do . Well , as I listened to Mr. Pilcher everything became quite clear to me . I resolved I would accept Captain Wentworth 's pure unselfish devotion and make it a lever to raise all my ideals and aspirations !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . But there was n't anything in Mr. Pilcher 's sermon about ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Oh yes , there was a lot about ideals and aspirations .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Yes , but not the sort of aspirations you have for Lucas . I suppose you know he makes love to every woman he comes across ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . He told me he had been led into one or two unworthy attachments .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Yes ! That 's quite right . So he has ! One or two !</stage>
   <stage>Renie . That was before he met me .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Yes , and this will be before he meets the next lady .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . [ Looks at DOLLY severely . ] My dear Dolly , with your light frivolous nature it is impossible for you to understand a pure and exalted attachment like ours . Listen ! [ Taking out a letter . ] This will show you his fine nature , his fine feelings — “ From the first moment I saw you —— ”</stage>
   <stage>MATT enters .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . [ Putting letter in pocket . ] Well , have you had a pleasant walk ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Very pleasant — and instructive . The Professor asked me to remind you that he 's waiting for you at the fish-pond .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . I 'd better go . I shall get a little lecture all to myself if I do n't . [ Going off , to DOLLY . ] Thank you , dear , so much for your kind invitation to stay on !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Do n't mention it !</stage>
   <stage>Renie . I shall try to manage it . [ Exit .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Yes , I 'm sure you will .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Mrs. Sturgess going to stay on ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . She wants me to invite her . But I wo n't if I can help it . [ Goes to him suddenly . ] Dad !</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Well ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . That wretched Lucas !</stage>
   <stage>Matt . What about him ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . No , I 've promised her not to breathe a word . So you must guess . [ Pause . ] Have you guessed ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . [ After a pause . ] Yes . Well , I — [ Begins to chuckle . ] So Lucas is up to his old games !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . My own guest ! Under my own roof ! It 's too horrid of him .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . [ Chuckling . ] It is ! It 's too bad ! The rascal .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Oh , it 's more than half her fault ! It 's just like her !</stage>
   <stage>[ MATT suddenly bursts from a chuckle into a roar .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . What are you laughing at ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . I 've just left —— [ Chuckling . ] I 've just left the Professor down at the fish-pond explaining to Lucas all about his gray matter , and —— [ Roars .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . I do n't see anything to laugh at .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Twelve miles in the snow —— I say , Doll , we 're making a splendid start for the New Year !</stage>
   <stage>[ Laughing .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Dad ! Will you please leave off ? [ Shaking his shoulder . ] Will you be serious ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Yes , my dear !! [ Pulling himself together and straightening his features . ] Yes , I will . After all , it 's a serious matter .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . It 's very serious for me , in a neighbourhood like this !</stage>
   <stage>Matt . It 's serious for me , as I was Lucas 's guardian . And it 's serious for him . If he goes and plays the fool , it may spoil his career — the young ass !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Very well , then , will you please treat it seriously and set to work and help me ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . How far have matters gone ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Oh , there 's no real harm done at present .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . How do you know ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Oh , Lucas is writing her silly letters and she 's talking about his pure and exalted devotion , and making it a lever to raise all her ideals and aspirations .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . [ Shakes his head . ] That looks bad ! That looks very dangerous for her .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Oh , no ; she knows how to take care of herself . But it 's dangerous for me !</stage>
   <stage>Matt . How , dangerous for you ? !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . If there 's the least bit of scandal she 'll contrive to drag me into it ! I know her so well .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . [ Walking about , cogitating . ] Yes , and we must n't let Lucas make a mess of it .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . What can we do ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . When I was over at Aldershot last week Sir John said something about giving Lucas an A. D. C. in India . I 'll drive over to-morrow and ask Sir John to pack Lucas out of the country for a year or two !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . That 's a good idea . But it may take some time ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . A week or so , perhaps more .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . But if they find out they 're going to be parted , it is just this next week when there will be all the danger .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . That 's true .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . They ought to be parted to-night .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . They ought ! They ought ! Not a doubt about it ! Not a shadow of doubt ! They ought to be parted to-night !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Dad ! I believe I can frighten Renie out of it .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Frighten her ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . I 'll try ! And you must take Lucas in hand ——</stage>
   <stage>Matt . H 'm ! Is n't Harry the right person ——?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . No , I sha'n ' t tell Harry . Harry would only get into a temper and muddle it . No , you must get Lucas to take himself off .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Take himself off !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . I wo n't have him here . You can tell him so . Be very severe with him .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . [ Dubious . ] H 'm !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Take a very high tone .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . I 'm not sure that taking a high tone is quite in my line .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Then please try it . Dad , you do realize how very serious this is , do n't you ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Yes , of course . Very well , I 'll tackle Lucas . We 'll see what a high tone will do with him . Heigho ! Sad ! Sad !! Sad !!!— Sad ! Sad !! Sad !! !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Hush !</stage>
   <stage>LUCAS and HARRY enter . LUCAS looks round for RENIE . DOLLY and MATT talk in whispers as if settling a plan . HARRY goes up to the collecting-box , takes out his knife and begins to scrape off the label .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ In a very severe tone to LUCAS , who is peeping into conservatory . ] Are you looking for anything ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . I was wondering whether there was any tea going .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Same severe tone . ] The tea is not in the conservatory .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . No , but I thought it might be getting on to the time ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Same tone . ] The tea will be served in due course .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . [ Surprised at her tone . ] Is anything the matter ?</stage>
   <stage>[ DOLLY looks at him severely , says nothing , turns to MATT . LUCAS looks puzzled , goes away , and again looks furtively into conservatory for RENIE .</stage>
   <stage>Harry . [ Scraping away at the collecting-box . ] Do n't forget , Doll — our cosy half hour after tea ——</stage>
   <stage>[ Nodding at the writing-desk .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . I wo n't forget .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . [ Has come up behind HARRY , touches the arm he is scraping with . ] Hospital for Incurables ! I should n't scrape that off at present .</stage>
   <p>CURTAIN .</p>
   <stage>( Four or five hours pass between Acts I and II . )</stage>
   <p>ACT II .</p>
   <stage>SCENE : The same , on the same evening , after dinner . The sofa is now brought down below the fireplace , and fronts the audience a little diagonally , its right end being farthest up stage . The small table with the hospital box , and the easy chair are above the sofa , a little to the right of it .</stage>
   <stage>Enter RENIE , much distressed and agitated . DOLLY follows quickly , closes the door cautiously and mysteriously .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . But I do n't understand . Captain Wentworth and I have been so little together ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Well , my dear , there it is ! My father is the last man to pry into other people 's affairs , but you see it has been forced upon his notice . And from the tone he took ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . What tone ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . He was very severe .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . [ Alarmed . ] But what did he say he had seen ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . He would n't go into particulars . He seemed very much upset ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Upset ? !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Perhaps I ought to say shocked .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Shocked ? !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . And when my father is shocked it must be something very glaring ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . [ More and more alarmed . ] But there has n't been anything glaring ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Well , dear , of course , you know .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . But I cannot imagine —— [ Suddenly . ] It must have been that day at the stile !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Perhaps . What happened ? No , I do n't wish to hear ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Captain Wentworth assisted me over the stile ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Well ?——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . That 's all . He may have taken a little longer about it than was quite necessary , and I may have leaned a little heavier than the circumstances required . But it was all done in perfectly good taste .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Shakes her head . ] It can n't have been the stile .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Then what ——? [ Cudgels her brains . ] The dairy !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Very likely . Was that very — no , do n't tell me ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . There 's nothing to tell . The woman at the farm , Mrs .——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Biggs ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Biggs , asked me to go over her model dairy .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Did she ask Lucas ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . He came . Mrs. Biggs insisted on our tasting her mince pies ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Mince pies —? Yes ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . While she went to get one ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Get one ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . She was n't out of the dairy ten seconds ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . No — and then ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Captain Wentworth —— a ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Respected you !</stage>
   <stage>Renie . [ Firing up . ] He is always most respectful ! In the most delicate , exquisitely chivalrous way , he implored me for one first and only kiss , and just as I was refusing him , somebody passed the dairy windows ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . My father often strolls that way ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . But I was quite cold and correct —— [ Very anxiously . ] Dolly , tell me exactly what Mr. Barron said ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . At first he was going to speak to you himself , but I said , “ No , that 's my duty ! I 'm her oldest friend ; I 'll talk to her ! ”</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Ye — es ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . So , at last he consented , and said : “ Very well . Be very firm with her , because this sort of thing taking place under my very nose and under my daughter 's roof is what I cannot , and will not , tolerate for one moment ! ”</stage>
   <stage>Renie . He must have passed the dairy windows !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Yes .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . And jumped to a wrong conclusion .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Yes . And that is n't the worst ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . [ Freshly alarmed . ] Not the worst ? !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Now , do n't be alarmed , dear ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . About what ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Did n't you notice something strange in your husband 's manner at dinner ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . No . What makes you think ——?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . My dear , if my father noticed it , why not your husband ? Suppose all this time the Professor has been quietly , stealthily watching you and Lucas .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . [ Alarmed . ] Dolly !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . And waiting his time ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Oh , Dolly !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Did n't you notice how he insisted on your going to the fish-pond ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Yes , he did !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Did n't it strike you there was something in that ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . No , and he has n't said anything ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Of course not . Naturally he would hide his suspicions from you till the right moment .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Right moment ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Now , dear , you see how serious things are . You must n't run any more risks . This must be broken off to-night .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . To-night ? !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Now , what can I do to help you ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . You might tell Mr. Barron there was nothing in the dairy windows .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Of course I 'll tell him , but if he saw ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . But there was nothing . Absolutely nothing ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . No , dear . What else can I do ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Could you find out exactly how much he has seen and heard , and — a — pump him a little ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . I do n't like pumping people — still — What else ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . [ Breaking down . ] Oh , Dolly , this blow could not have fallen at a more cruel moment .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . No , dear .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . It came just when I had lost all the illusions of girlhood , when all my woman 's nature began to cry out ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Yes — [ Suddenly . ] Hark ! [ Listens . ] Hush !</stage>
   <stage>[ Creeps up to door , listens , opens it , looks out , closes it again .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . What was it ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Hush ! Voices ! I thought it might be Lucas and the Professor quarrelling .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . I really do n't think my husband suspects ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . No , I daresay it 's only my imagination .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . And if he did — Dolly , is there one man living , except my husband , who would condemn me for being the object of a noble , single-hearted devotion like Captain Wentworth 's ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . No , dear , perhaps not . But , you see , as husbands they take quite a different view of things from what they do merely as men .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Tell me candidly , Dolly , you see nothing wrong in it , do you ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Well , dear , when you say wrong ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . But I assure you there is n't — nothing could be further from my thoughts .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . No , dear — still , people are so full of prejudice — now what can I do ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . [ Clasping DOLLY 'S hand warmly . ] Oh , Dolly , you can help me so much .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ A little alarmed . ] Can I ? Tell me ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . If Lucas and I are parted —— [ Breaks down . ] I can n't bear it ! I can n't bear it !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Try , dear ! Try !</stage>
   <stage>Renie . [ Sobbing . ] I will . And if at any time I long to hear how he bears our separation , you wo n't mind receiving a letter , and sending it on to me ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . I 'm afraid I could n't do that , dear . You see , I 'm so careless , and if I left the letter about , and Harry found it — no , dear ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . You wo n't help me ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Yes , dear , I 'll do anything in my power ! [ Suddenly . ] I 'll tell you what I can do !</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Yes ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . My father is telling Lucas he must leave to-night . Well , I can spare you all the pain and misery of saying “ Good-bye , ” and take one last message to him .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . [ Curtly . ] No , thank you . It 's most unkind of you to send him away like this . I must see him alone before he goes .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Shakes her head . ] My father insists , and suppose Lucas feels that he owes it to your reputation to go quietly ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Without seeing me ? !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . And suppose the Professor is really watching you ——</stage>
   <stage>[ RENIE shows great perplexity . DOLLY is watching her .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . If you do n't see Lucas , what message shall I take him ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Tell him how proud I am of his noble , unselfish devotion ; tell him I shall always look upon it as the one supreme happiness of my life to have known him ——</stage>
   <stage>The PROFESSOR and MATTHEW enter . The PROFESSOR has diagrams and illustrations in his hand . Following the PROFESSOR and MATT are HARRY and LUCAS . LUCAS , after a little time , comes up to DOLLY and RENIE , who are seated on sofa . The PROFESSOR is speaking to MATT as he enters , and is showing him an illustration .</stage>
   <stage>Prof. [ In his hard , metallic voice . ] Observe that woman 's facial angle — [ pointing ] the peculiar curve of the lip , and the irregular formation of the nose .</stage>
   <stage>[ Describing a little upward curve on the paper with his thumb .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . I have seen sweeter things in ladies ’ lips and noses .</stage>
   <stage>[ Describing the same little upward curve with his thumb on the paper .</stage>
   <stage>Prof. Can you be surprised at her history ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Who was she ?</stage>
   <stage>Prof. Jane Sweetman , the notorious trigamist . Looking at that woman 's cranium I maintain it was impossible for her to avoid ——</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Committing trigamy ?</stage>
   <stage>Prof. Well , some species of grave moral delinquency .</stage>
   <stage>[ DOLLY clutches RENIE 'S wrist significantly . The PROFESSOR hands the illustration to HARRY , who examines it . MATT moves away a step and unobtrusively feels his own nose and forehead .</stage>
   <stage>Harry . [ Has examined the illustration . ] By Jove , yes — anybody can see she was bound to come a moral cropper , eh ?</stage>
   <figure>
    <p>He hands the illustration to DOLLY , who passes it to RENIE , with a very significant glance , pointing out something on the paper . LUCAS leans over the back of the sofa between RENIE and DOLLY to look at the illustration . As he leans on the back of the sofa , DOLLY draws herself up very indignantly , gives him a severe look ; moves a little away from him , sits and looks very severely in front of her . He cannot understand her attitude , draws back a little and looks puzzled .</p>
   </figure>
   <stage>Prof. [ Bringing out another illustration , offering it to MATT . ] Now look at this .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . [ Taking illustration . ] Somebody 's brains !</stage>
   <stage>Prof. Tell me if you notice anything peculiar .</stage>
   <stage>[ HARRY leans over MATT 'S shoulder , and looks at the illustration . LUCAS again leans over the sofa , between DOLLY and RENIE . DOLLY again moves a little further away from him with another indignant look . LUCAS is again puzzled , but bends and looks over the illustration in RENIE 'S hands .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . So that 's Jane Sweetman ! Well , if Jane was bound to come a moral cropper , I 'm very glad I was n't bound to come a moral cropper with Jane , eh , Dolly ? [ Very pleasantly .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Very severely . ] I should scarcely have thought you troubled whom you came a moral cropper with !</stage>
   <stage>[ Looks at him severely , goes up to writing-desk , seats herself and writes letter . He feels himself snubbed , and moves a step or two back , stands and looks puzzled . PROFESSOR has been critically regarding MATT and HARRY , who have been looking at the illustration .</stage>
   <stage>Prof. Well , does anything strike you ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . No . [ Holding it out . ] Looks rather pulpy — rather — a — squashy ——</stage>
   <stage>Prof . Exactly ! Observe the soft , almost watery condition of that gray matter . What is the inevitable consequence ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . I could n't quite say — whom did that gray matter belong to ?</stage>
   <stage>Prof. Harriet Poy .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . I do n't remember Harriet ——</stage>
   <stage>Prof . The Pyromaniac . At the age of four set fire to her mother 's bed . At twelve was found saturating blankets with petroleum ; at sixteen fired three hayricks , for which she was sentenced to six months ’ imprisonment .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Poor Harriet ! But of course if her gray matter went and got watery ——</stage>
   <stage>Prof. Just so ! I maintain that with her gray matter in that condition it was a stupid crime to send her to prison .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Looking round from desk . ] But what are we to do with people whose gray matter goes wrong ?</stage>
   <stage>Prof . I propose to deal with that question at Edinburgh . [ To MATT . ] You might , perhaps , care to run down to Edinburgh for my lectures ——</stage>
   <stage>Matt . I should love it above all things ; but the fact is , I 'm so thoroughly of your opinion ——</stage>
   <stage>Prof. Are you ?! I 'm delighted I 've convinced you .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Completely . All my life I 've been doing things I should never have dreamed of doing if my gray matter had done its duty and not got watery .</stage>
   <stage>Harry . [ Begins . ] Yes , when you come to think of all the rotten things you find yourself doing , you feel , by Jove ——</stage>
   <stage>[ Suddenly recalls that he has said “ by Jove , ” and being near the collection-box , he quietly pulls sixpence out of his pocket and drops it in .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Bravo , Harry ! [ Patting him .</stage>
   <stage>Harry . Oh , I mean it !— Professor , is n't it time for our hundred up ?</stage>
   <stage>Prof. [ Taking out watch . ] In two minutes .</stage>
   <stage>Harry . I 'll go and get the balls out and chalk the cues . [ Going up to door . ] Doll , [ taps the writing-desk ] you put it off after tea — by-and-by , you know !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ She has finished letter , has risen , and closed writing-desk . ] By-and-by .</stage>
   <stage>Harry . Before we go to bed — do n't forget .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Oh , I sha'n ' t forget .</stage>
   <stage>[ Makes a wry face . Exit HARRY .</stage>
   <stage>Prof. Renie , you were complaining of headache . It would be wise to take a short stroll in the cool air .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Oh , very well .</stage>
   <stage>Prof. Wrap up thoroughly . Ten minutes , not longer .</stage>
   <stage>[ Exit . DOLLY , unseen by RENIE and LUCAS , slips the note she has been writing into MATT 'S hands . He takes it down stage , right , and reads it . RENIE and LUCAS have been talking , apart ; they move towards the door to get out , but DOLLY is standing in the way of their exit .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Oh , Renie ! I 'll put on my things , and come with you .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . But Captain Wentworth has offered ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . I 've a splitting headache — I must get a little air . And Dad wants to have a talk with Lucas , do n't you ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . If he can spare five minutes .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Wo n't by-and-by be just as convenient ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Facing LUCAS , speaking firmly . ] No , by-and-by will not be just as convenient . Now , Renie , we 'll leave them together .</stage>
   <stage>[ Gets RENIE off , turns , looks daggers at LUCAS , goes off after RENIE , closes door in his face . He opens it , and goes after her .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . I say , Doll , what 's up ? [ Follows her off . ] What 's the matter ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . [ Reading DOLLY 'S note . ] “ Be very severe with him . Make a great point of the dairy windows . He 'll understand . ” Dairy windows ?</stage>
   <stage>[ Puts the note in his pocket , as LUCAS re-enters , puzzled and disappointed .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . I can n't think what 's the matter with Dolly . She has done nothing but snub me all the evening .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . [ Looking at him sternly . ] So I should imagine !</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . [ Startled by his manner . ] I say , have I done anything ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Done anything ! I 'm a man of the world ! nobody can accuse me of being strait-laced , and therefore I suppose you think you can come here and set at defiance all the —— it 's disgraceful !</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Would you mind telling me what you 're hinting at ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . I 'm not hinting ! I 'm going to speak out very plainly , and I tell you that I look upon your conduct as something atrocious !</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . I say , Uncle , what 's all this about ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . What 's it about ? What 's it about ? It 's about the dairy windows !</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Then it was you — phew !— so it was you ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Well , after the dairy windows , can you stand there and tell me you are n't thoroughly , completely , heartily ashamed of yourself ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Well , I suppose I am . But , after all , it was n't so very bad ——</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Not bad ? !</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Well , not so d — ee — d awful .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . [ Regards him for a few moments . ] Well , I 'm astonished ! If you do n't consider your behaviour d — ee — d awful , will you please find me some word that will describe it ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . You know you 're putting a much worse construction on this than the necessities of the case demand .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . What ? !</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . I 've nothing to reproach myself with . Mrs. Biggs was n't out of the dairy three minutes , and you were hanging about the windows all the time .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . I was hanging about the windows ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Yes , and I must say that when you saw two people engaged in an interesting conversation the least you could do was to pass on and take no notice .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . “ Interesting conversation ” ? !</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Well , what did you call it ? If it comes to that , what do you accuse me of ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Well , here you are , on the first day of the year , after listening to a most eloquent sermon , after making a solemn resolution to give up all your bad habits ——</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Excuse me , I expressly stated that I did n't mean to give up all my bad habits . And I do n't call this a bad habit .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . You do n't call making love to a married woman a bad habit ? !</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Of course in one sense it is a bad habit . But it is n't a bad habit in the sense that other bad habits are bad habits . Look at all the decent chaps who 've been led into it !</stage>
   <stage>Matt . That does n't excuse you . And if you think that I 'm going to countenance your conduct , you are very much mistaken in your estimate of my character .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . [ Very quietly . ] May I ask you one simple question ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Well ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . When you were my age , if you found yourself alone in a dairy with a good-looking woman , and she was good for a dozen kisses or so , would n't you have taken advantage of it ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . No !</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Not at my age ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . No — no ——</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Well , what would you have done ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . I should have summoned all my resolution ——</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Oh , that be hanged ! Come , Uncle , no humbug ! Man to man !</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Well , I do n't say that at your age I might not have been tempted — and of course we must all go through a certain amount of experience , or how should we be able to advise you youngsters ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . I say , no confounded nonsense — your uncle Archie ——</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Dear old chap !</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . What use did you make of his advice ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Well , I remember his talking to me very seriously — I suppose I was about your age — did I ever tell you , Lucas , [ taking LUCAS 'S arm affectionately ] about a very remarkable auburn-haired girl , Madge Seaforth ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . No .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . And my racing her across Salisbury Plain at night ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . No .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Forty-eight miles one glorious May night ! I let her beat me ! God bless her ! I let her beat me ! And just as the sun rose we caught sight of Salisbury spire .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Sounds rather jolly !</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Jolly ? And the bacon and eggs we got through for breakfast ! Jolly ? It was romance ! It was poetry ! Ah ! Lu , my boy , you may say what you like , there 's nothing like it on this side heaven . I told you about Mrs. Satterwaite dressing up as a widow and selling her husband ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . No ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Well , I bet the little hussy a fiver . Oh , Satterwaite richly deserved all he got — I can see Satterwaite 's face now , and hers , as she stepped out of the cupboard , with the wickedest twinkle in the wickedest black eye ! Ho ! Ho ! Heigho ! Sad ! Sad !! Sad !!!— Sad ! Sad !! Sad !!! Come , come , Lucas ! This wo n't do ! This will never do ! Now to get back to this business of yours ——</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Well ——</stage>
   <stage>Matt . When I was your guardian I let you have a pretty good fling ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . You did !</stage>
   <stage>Matt . The pace was rather scorching ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Rather !</stage>
   <stage>Matt . I never pulled you up ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . No , and I 'm grateful .</stage>
   <stage>[ Shaking hands very cordially .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . That 's all right . Now , old chap , you 've got to pull up !</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Pull up ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Short . This Mrs. Sturgess — Dolly says there 's a lot of nonsense going on , gushing letters and so on ,— damned silly thing writing letters , Lu ——</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Yes , I know .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Well , what do you do it for ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . I do n't know .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . You 're seeing her every day . If you must carry on this tomfoolery , why not do it by word of mouth ? Why write it down , to show what an ass you 've been ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . I 'm sure I do n't know .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Do you know why you 're carrying on with her at all ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Well , naturally a chap — naturally ——</stage>
   <stage>Matt . You 're either in love with her , or you are n't ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . I can n't say I 'm exactly in love with her ——</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Then why are you making love to her ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Well , she 's a jolly good-looking woman , and naturally a chap — naturally — I do n't know that I ai n't a bit in love with her .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Well , it does n't much matter . If you are n't in love with her you 're a fool to risk a scandal . If you are in love you 'll most likely do some silly jackass thing that will knock your career on the head , eh ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Well , when you look at it that way ——</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Look at it that way ! Anyhow , she 's a married woman , and you 're here as a guest — it is n't the right thing to do , is it ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . No , it is n't .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Very well , then , do n't do it . Do n't do it ! Cut it ! You will ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . I 've got to , I suppose .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Yes , you 've got to . You can tell Doll I gave it to you hot and strong , and you 're going to clear out , and not see Mrs. Sturgess again ——</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Not see her again ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Is n't that what you mean to do ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Yes , I suppose . I say , what did you see at the dairy windows ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . I did n't see anything at all !</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Nothing at all ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . I was n't there !</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Then how ——?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Dolly put me up to it . [ Laughs at him .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Dolly ?</stage>
   <stage>DOLLY enters with a cloak which she throws on sofa .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Ah , Doll ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Looking severely at LUCAS . ] Have you spoken to him ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Yes , very seriously , extra seriously , and he 's going to do the right thing and clear out , are n't you , Lucas ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . [ A little unwillingly . ] Yes .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . [ Clapping him on the shoulder . ] Good chap ! Good chap !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Still a little severe . ] I 'm pleased to hear it . [ To LUCAS . ] You 've behaved in a most scandalous ——</stage>
   <stage>Matt . He has . I 've told him all that . [ Winks at DOLLY to keep her quiet . ] And he sees it quite plainly , do n't you ?</stage>
   <stage>[ Winks at LUCAS to prompt him .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Then it 's quite broken off ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Quite ! Is n't it , Lu ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Yes , I suppose . I should like to say ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Yes ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . That nothing has taken place which , if rightly looked at , could reflect discredit either upon the lady , or , I hope , upon myself . And secondly , whatever fault there may have been , is entirely mine .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . That 's satisfactory ! It always ought to be the man 's fault . Heaven forbid it should ever be theirs . Good chap ! Good chap ! [ Patting him . ] Dolly , he 's behaving splendidly . Now , Lu , good-night .</stage>
   <stage>[ DOLLY rings bell .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . [ Surprised . ] Good-night ? !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Good-night , and good-bye ! [ Holding out her hand .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . You are n't going to turn me out to-night !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . You said it was quite broken off .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Yes , but —— [ turns to MATT with appealing gesture . ] Uncle , you did n't mean to pack me off like this ——</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Yes , my boy ! Remember the occasion . First day of the New Year . Take time by the forelock . Off you go !</stage>
   <stage>[ Taking him by the shoulder and trying to get him off .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . [ Resisting . ] Oh no ! I do n't see it in that light at all .</stage>
   <stage>[ Sinks comfortably into arm-chair .</stage>
   <stage>CRIDDLE appears at door .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Criddle , please have Captain Wentworth 's portmanteau taken to the billiard-room .</stage>
   <stage>Criddle . Yes , ma'am .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . He wishes to change there , and please send to the Red Lion and ask them to have Captain Wentworth 's horse saddled .</stage>
   <stage>Criddle . Yes , ma'am . [ Going .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Criddle , what 's the weather like ?</stage>
   <stage>Criddle . It 's a bit colder , sir . Looks as if we were going to have another heavy fall of snow .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . I do n't think I 'll go to-night , Criddle . If I want the gee saddled , I 'll go and tell them myself .</stage>
   <stage>Criddle . Yes , sir . [ Exit .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . [ In arm-chair . ] I say , Dolly , you do n't really expect me to go careering over that heath at this ungodly hour ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . You can n't stay here . Renie is very much upset ; she has had hysterics . So I 've put her in the spare room .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Well , you can give me a shake-down somewhere — in the billiard-room .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Shakes her head . ] I can n't ask the servants to make up impossible beds in impossible places at this ungodly hour .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . I call this beastly unfair of you , Doll .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Unfair ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Just as I 'd summoned up all my resolution to do the right thing , and avoid ructions for your sake , you pounce down on me , and order me off the premises , and ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Getting angry . ] If you do n't behave yourself and go off quietly , I shall have to order you off the premises .</stage>
   <stage>[ Makes an appeal by gesture to MATT to get him off .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Now , my hero ! [ Lifting him out of the arm-chair . ] Buckle on your armor ! Sally forth ! Once more unto the breach !</stage>
   <stage>[ With some difficulty he raises LUCAS out of the chair .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Well , I 'll go and have a look at the weather . [ Goes sulkily up to door . ] Mind you , if you turn me out I wo n't be responsible if there 's a flare up ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Very well , so long as we do n't have a flare-up here . Oh !</stage>
   <stage>[ Rings the bell again .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . [ Goes off , sulky , muttering . ] Of all the — turning me out — beastly infernal nuisance !</stage>
   <stage>[ Exit grumbling , leaving door open .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . It would serve them both right if there was to be a flare-up — only I 'm sure she 'd drag me into it somehow . [ CRIDDLE appears at door . ] Please send and ask them at the Red Lion to saddle Captain Wentworth 's horse and send it here at once .</stage>
   <stage>Criddle . Yes , ma'am . [ Exit .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Lucas is going to behave as badly over this as he did over the governess . Dad ——!</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Well ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Of course , Lucas is in the army , but surely he — he is n't a fair sample ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Oh no , oh no ! Lucas is very exceptional — quite exceptional .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . I thought so ! They can n't all be ——</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Oh no ! I 'm glad to say ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . I 'm determined he shall go to-night .</stage>
   <stage>LUCAS re-enters .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . I say , Dolly , I wish you 'd come and look at the weather .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . What for ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . There 's a great black cloud — it 's going to come down !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Enraged . ] I do n't care if the heavens come down ! You 're going back to Aldershot to-night .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . But I tell you —— [ Appeals to MATT . ] It 's simply impossible for me to ride across that heath ——</stage>
   <stage>Matt . But you rode across it last night in a howling snowstorm ——</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Yes , I did ! Last night ! And never again , thank you ! No ! I do n't mind shaking down anywhere to oblige ——</stage>
   <stage>[ He is about to drop again into the arm-chair , but MATT gently pushes him aside and drops into the chair himself .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . [ Going to sofa . ] Anywhere to oblige !</stage>
   <stage>[ Drops comfortably on to sofa .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Comes up to him finally . ] Lucas , this is abominable ! I suppose you think because we treated you so leniently over that wretched governess ——</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Well , I thought you were pretty deuced hard down on us ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . What ?! Oh ! [ Appeals to MATT .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . I did n't mind your slanging me , but you might have had a little consideration for her feelings , because , after all , she was one of your own sex !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . My own sex ! The minx !</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . And an orphan !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Orphan ! [ To MATT . ] Go and speak to him ! Go and speak to him !</stage>
   <stage>[ MATT rises and goes to LUCAS . DOLLY sits down in despair .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Come , Lu . You 're not playing the game ! You promised to take yourself off .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . [ Comfortably seated . ] Well , I will take myself off , only let me take myself off in my own way .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . It 's useless your staying ! Renie wo n't see you again .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Wo n't she ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . No . She gave me a last message for you ——</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Did she ? Why did n't you give it to me ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . If I tell you , will you take yourself off ?</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Yes , of course . What was her last message ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . She said “ She should always value your noble devotion , and be proud that she had known you ; but you must see how hopeless it was , and that she trusted you would go away at once and leave her to respect you , as you had always respected her ! ”</stage>
   <stage>Matt . A very pretty , touching little adieu ! Does her great credit . Now , Lu ! Cut it ! Come , my boy !</stage>
   <stage>[ Lifts him up off sofa . LUCAS gets up very reluctantly .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Well , if I must go — good-night !</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Good-night . [ Shaking hands . ] I may see you to-morrow afternoon .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Where ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . I 'm driving over to Aldershot to see Sir John . I shall look you up ——</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . I may not be there in the afternoon ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Lucas , you 're coming over here ——</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . No — no ; I 'm not . You should n't suspect me .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . It wo n't be the least use your coming ——</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . I know that . Well , good-bye , Doll ——</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Good-bye . [ Shaking hands .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . [ Is going up to door slowly and reluctantly , turns . ] I suppose if I were to give you my solemn promise I would n't see her , I could n't shake down on that sofa .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Sternly and decisively . ] No !</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . [ Goes a few more steps towards door , turns . ] I suppose I could n't see Mrs. Sturgess ? [ DOLLY looks indignant . ] Only to say good-bye .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . No ! She was nearly undressed when I left her . She 's asleep by now !</stage>
   <stage>Enter RENIE fully dressed , looking very interesting and tearful . Throughout the scene she preserves the air of a martyr .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Indignantly . ] Renie , you promised me you would n't come downstairs again !</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Yes , dear , but I felt I could n't rest under your father 's unjust suspicion . [ Goes up to MATT , seizes his hand sympathetically . ] Dolly tells me you have been watching the friendship that all unconsciously has sprung up between Captain Wentworth and myself ——</stage>
   <stage>Matt . [ Uncomfortable . ] Not exactly watching ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . I feel you may have seen , or guessed something , that has given you a wrong impression .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . No , no ! I assure you ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . If you have , I beg you to speak out and give us a chance of defending ourselves . Tell us exactly what you have seen , and what you suspect ——</stage>
   <stage>Matt . My dear Mrs. Sturgess , I have n't seen anything , and I do n't suspect anything .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . You really mean that ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Yes — yes ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . [ Clasping his hand eagerly . ] Thank you so much . Friendship between a man and a woman is so misunderstood .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . It is .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Yes , Lucas had a friendship with a governess here which we all misunderstood — till afterwards .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . I say , Dolly , do n't you ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Now that there is no chance of your misjudging our friendship , I do n't mind saying —— [ Shows signs of breaking down . ] You wo n't misunderstand me ? [ Clinging to his hand .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . No , no !</stage>
   <stage>Renie . My life has not been altogether a happy one .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . I 'm sure it has n't !</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Under other circumstances — let that pass ! [ Wrings MATT 'S hands . ] Thank you , thank you ! [ Goes to LUCAS . ] Captain Wentworth , I shall always be proud to have known you .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . I 've told him all that !</stage>
   <stage>[ MATT hushes DOLLY with a gesture .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . I shall always cherish the memory of our friendship , but it might be misunderstood , and so [ breaking down , but bearing up with an effort ] , you will behave like the gallant gentleman I know you to be , and say good-bye to me for ever !</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Nobly spoken ! Very nobly spoken indeed !</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Well , if you insist ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . I do ! Good-bye for ever !</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Good-bye . [ They have a long hand-shake .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Good-bye .</stage>
   <stage>[ Tears herself away from him and tragically throws herself on sofa . LUCAS follows her up .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . I say , Mrs. Sturgess ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . [ Face buried in hands , moans out . ] Go , go ! In pity 's name do n't make it harder for me !</stage>
   <stage>Matt . In pity 's name do n't make it harder for her .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Looking off at door . ] They 'll be coming out of the billiard-room directly .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Now , Lucas ——</stage>
   <stage>CRIDDLE appears at door .</stage>
   <stage>Criddle . Your horse is waiting for you , sir .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . My horse ? !</stage>
   <stage>Criddle . Yes , sir , just outside .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . What on earth do they mean ? A valuable horse like that — just clipped — standing about on a night like this — who told them ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . I did . The horse is waiting to take you back to Aldershot .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . I can n't go back to Aldershot in this kit . [ Pointing to his dress-clothes . ] Tell them to take it back to the Red Lion !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . And Criddle , give the man Captain Wentworth 's portmanteau to take to the Red Lion at the same time .</stage>
   <stage>Criddle . Yes , ma'am . [ Exit .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . [ Grumbling . ] Well , of all —— Good-bye , Mrs. Sturgess .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . You 've said good-bye ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . [ Still tragic on sofa . ] Farewell — for ever !</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Good-night , Dolly !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Farewell — for a good long time . [ Shaking hands .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Good-night , Uncle .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Good-night , Lucas . [ Shaking hands .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . [ Turns at door . ] Happen to have your cigar-case handy ?</stage>
   <stage>[ MATT takes out cigar-case , offers it .</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Could you spare two ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Certainly !</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . I 've got a jolly long ride , I 'll take three if you do n't mind .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Do !</stage>
   <stage>Lucas . Thank'ee . Well , good-night , everybody .</stage>
   <stage>[ MATT gets LUCAS off , closes door after him .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . [ Rouses herself from sofa . ] Has he gone ? Is it all over ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . I hope so . [ Goes and rings bell twice .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . [ Goes to MATT impulsively — and seizes his hand . ] At least this bitter experience has gained me one true friend .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . [ Embarrassed . ] Yes ——</stage>
   <stage>Renie . [ Wrings his hand in gratitude . ] Thank you so much ——</stage>
   <stage>[ He gets away from her and shows relief ; takes out cigar and prepares to light it .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . [ Standing in the middle of the room , pitying herself . ] That 's where we get the worst of it , we women who have hearts ! We must feel , we must show our feelings , and then we get trampled down in the fight . Oh , Dolly , how I envy you your nature !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Very chilly . ] Are you going into the spare room , dear ?</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Anywhere ! Anywhere ! Yes , the spare room !</stage>
   <stage>PETERS , DOLLY 'S maid , appears at door .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Peters , will you bank up the fire in the spare room and make everything comfortable for Mrs. Sturgess ?</stage>
   <stage>Peters . Yes , ma'am . [ Exit .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . [ Still in the middle of the room , pitying herself . ] So my poor little tragedy is ended ! [ To MATT .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Yes . Well , let 's be thankful no bones are broken !</stage>
   <stage>Renie . No bones , but how about hearts ? Well , I must bear it . [ With a weary smile . ] Must n't I ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . I 'm afraid you must .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Good-night ! [ Wrings his hand with gratitude . ] Good-night !</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Good-night .</stage>
   <stage>[ Gets away from her , and busies himself with his cigar , lights it .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Good-night , Dolly !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . I 'll come up with you , and stay till you 're quite comfortable .</stage>
   <stage>Renie . Shall I ever be comfortable again ? Will things ever be the same ? I wonder !</stage>
   <stage>[ Goes off mournfully and tragically at back with a prolonged sigh . MATT has seated himself on sofa and taken up paper .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Calls his attention to RENIE 'S exit and makes a furious gesture after her . ] I know she 'll be here next Christmas ! [ Marches down enraged to MATT and repeats in an angry , aggrieved way , emphasizing each word . ] I know that woman will be here next Christmas !</stage>
   <stage>Matt . [ Seated comfortably with his cigar and paper ] I daresay she will ——</stage>
   <stage>[ DOLLY marches indignantly and decisively to door and exit .</stage>
   <p>CURTAIN .</p>
   <stage>( Half an hour passes between Acts II and III . )</stage>
   <p>ACT III .</p>
   <stage>SCENE : The same . Discover MATT in the same seat and attitude , with paper and cigar . DOLLY enters .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Well ? ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . I 've had an awful time with her ——</stage>
   <stage>Matt . How ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Seated . ] First she had another fit of hysterics — then she longed to go out into the night air to cool her fevered brow — then she moaned out something about her noble Lucas ——</stage>
   <stage>Matt . And now ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . I 've persuaded her to let Peters undress her . I 've got her off my hands at last .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . That 's a comfort .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Dad !</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Yes .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . I wo n't have her here next Christmas .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . No , I would n't .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Repeats in a slow , aggrieved , enraged way , emphasizing each syllable . ] Whatever happens , I will not have that woman in my house next Christmas . You hear that ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Yes . You wo n't have her here next Christmas !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . I mean it , this time . And I wo n't have Lucas here again for a very long time .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . I would n't .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Seated beside him . ] Dad , please put away that paper . You 're going over to Aldershot to-morrow to try to get Lucas exchanged ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . I 'll try .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Where can you get him sent ?</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Gibraltar — India — South Africa — according as an appointment happens to be vacant .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . The further the better , and the longer .</stage>
   <stage>PETERS appears at door .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Well , Peters , have you made Mrs. Sturgess comfortable ?</stage>
   <stage>Peters . I 'm trying to , ma'am .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Is she in bed yet ?</stage>
   <stage>Peters . No , ma'am .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Not in bed !</stage>
   <stage>Peters . No , ma'am , but she seems rather quieter .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . She let you undress her , I suppose ?</stage>
   <stage>Peters . I 'm just going to , ma'am . She says her brain is still throbbing .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Throbbing !</stage>
   <stage>Peters . And could you lend her your hop-pillow ?</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . You 'll find it in my wardrobe .</stage>
   <stage>Peters . Yes , ma'am .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Peters , pat up the hop-pillow for her , and insist on undressing her ——</stage>
   <stage>Peters . Yes , ma'am . [ Going .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Do n't leave her till you 've seen her comfortably in bed .</stage>
   <stage>Peters . No , ma'am .</stage>
   <stage>[ Exit . A gust of wind and a little rattle of hail on the conservatory window .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Whew ! The New Year means business !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . And so do I , as Lucas will find out .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . He is finding it out , on that heath !</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Yes ! [ With a little laugh . ] Ha ! ha ! [ A louder gust and rattle of hail . ] Listen ! Listen ! Ha ! And he might have been here playing a comfortable rubber by the fire — if he 'd simply behaved himself !</stage>
   <stage>Matt . If he 'd “ simply behaved ” himself ! What we all miss through not “ simply behaving ” ourselves .</stage>
   <stage>[ Another gust .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . [ Laughs . ] Ah ! He 's catching it ! I shall insist on Renie driving out with me to-morrow afternoon .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . Yes .</stage>
   <stage>Dolly . Then she can n't meet Lucas . That will be another sell for him — [ Another furious gust and rattle . ] Listen ! Ha ! ha ! I wonder how far Lucas has got !</stage>
   <stage>[ A noise of something being knocked over in the conservatory , which is lighted .</stage>
   <stage>Matt . [ Goes to the conservatory door , looks in ; is startled . ] Hillo ! hillo ! What ? !</stage>

     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>I did n't like the look of the weather ! I did n't like the look of it at all ! So I got them to give me a shake-down at the Red Lion ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p><stage>Indignantly .</stage>Shake-down at the Red Lion !</p>

     <p>Yes , on their sofa ! You need n't look so black ! I asked you first , to let me have a shake-down here — on that sofa ——</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>But why have you come back here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>Well , I must have dropped those cigars uncle Matt gave me . I put them carefully in my side pocket , and when I got down to the Red Lion , lo and behold , they were n't there !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>You could have got a cigar at the Red Lion ——</p>

     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p><stage>Turns to MATT for sympathy .</stage>I could have got a cigar at the Red Lion !<stage>To DOLLY .</stage>No , thank you ! So I thought I 'd just stroll up here in the hope ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>In the hope of seeing Mrs. Sturgess ! But she 's safely in bed this time , and there 's no possible chance of your seeing her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>In the hope of getting Harry to give me a decent smoke . Well , I came into the Hall and not wishing to rile you by my hated presence — I slipped into the conservatory ——</p>

     <p>No , not unless the weather takes a turn . No , Dolly said that as the spare room was occupied , would I mind getting a shake-down at the Red Lion . So I did , and as I 've got nothing to smoke , may I cadge a cigar ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Sounds just the thing for a New Year 's drink , to brace up good resolutions . Come along ! I 'll have a regular night-cap of it .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p><stage>Very solemnly and severely .</stage>My darling , remember what Pilcher said about procrastination . And remember our resolutions last night . If we break them on the first night of the year , where shall we be on the thirty-first of December ?</p>

     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>I 'm horribly fagged .</p>

     <p>No , dear — at least a little sometimes .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>No , dear , I can n't let you accuse yourself . I was quite in the wrong .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>You wo n't grumble at that , for when I first put it on , you stood and looked at me and said , “ I want to know how it is , Doll , that the moment a dress gets on to your shoulders , it seems to brisk up , and be as cocky and proud of itself —— ”</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Again attempting to embrace him .</stage>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>It 's a trimming — a lot of little touches — a sort of — a — a — a —<stage>making a little descriptive gesture</stage>a suggestion — a motif ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>And Mr. John Spearman 's motif is that I should pay him five hundred and fifty-six pounds . Well , I do n't like Mr. John Spearman 's motifs , and I 'm not going to fall in with them .<stage>Puts the bill on the table rather angrily , takes up another , reads .</stage>“ Artistic lingerie ! ” I wonder why all these people call themselves artists ! “ Underwear of daintiness and distinction . ”</p>

     <p>Well , you 've always praised ——</p>

     <p>Yes . In future , I 'm going to be very careful what articles of your dress I praise . “ Three pairs of blue silk garters , forty-five shillings . ”<stage>She has settled herself in the armchair , looking a little sulky and obstinate , leaning back and pettishly swinging one leg over the other .</stage>What have you got to say to that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Garters are necessary .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>Yes , but why three ? And why blue silk ? Why do n't you speak ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>The garters can speak for themselves !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>Very well . Garters that can speak for themselves can pay for themselves !<stage>Dashes the bill on the table , takes up another .

     <p>Well , if you will smoke those horrid strong things you can n't wonder I have to disinfect the house for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>Disinfect the house for me ! You 'll very soon disinfect the house of me !<stage>Glances through the remaining bills , groans , puts them on the table , and walks about in despair . DOLLY rises and is going off .</stage>Where are you going ?</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>My dear Harry , it will be quite useless for me to try to explain in your present state ——</p>

     <p>You 're not shouting ? !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>No , and if I am , is n't it enough to make a man shout when his wife —— MATT appears at the door in his dressing-gown and slippers .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Excuse my interrupting . But you know my room is just above this , and if you could manage to pitch your voices in rather a softer key ——</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>By Jove , I 'd forgotten ! We were getting a little noisy . I 'm awfully sorry .</p>

     <p>Now , my darling , we shall best arrive at an understanding if we avoid all temper , and discuss it in a calm , business-like way .</p>

     <p><stage>A little frightened .</stage>Ye-es ——</p>

     <p>Very well then , bring up your chair , and let us go into it , figure by figure , item by item , and see how we stand .</p>

     <p>As all what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>I can n't discuss it while you keep me at a distance !<stage>Suddenly rushes at him , seats herself on his knee , puts his arm round her waist , kisses him .</stage>There ! now I feel I can discuss it thoroughly .</p>

     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>I began to get quite frightened of you , Mr. Jobling .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>Jobling ?</p>

     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>You got so angry — and shouted ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>Well , there was no reason for that , especially as getting out of temper is the one thing I 'm quite resolved to conquer this New Year ——</p>

     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>One dozen pairs best silk hose , with clocks ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Yes — how much does that come to ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>Eleven pounds two ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>It does seem rather a high price , but ——</p>

     <p>You 're wearing them about the house ?</p>

     <p>I can n't go about the house without stockings . And I put them on for your especial benefit .<stage>He utters a contemptuous exclamation .</stage>They 're a lovely quality ——</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>I daresay .<stage>Turning away .</stage>I 'm not going to admire your stockings , or your ostrich ruffles , or your blue silk garters , or your motifs , or anything that is yours ! It 's too expensive !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p><stage>Dress an inch higher , looking down at her stockings .</stage>It 's the clocks you have to pay for ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>I beg your pardon , it 's the clocks I have n't got to pay for ! And do n't mean to — if I can help it . Idiotic thing to go and put clocks on stockings —<stage>muttering</stage>damned silly idiotic ——</p>

     <p>Ah !<stage>Goes to table , brings the hospital box and puts it in front of him .</stage>Double fine this time .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>What for ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Naughty swear word , and getting out of temper .</p>

     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>You did n't get out of temper ?! ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>Not at all . I 'm quite calm .<stage>Sulkily puts a shilling in the box .</stage>There !<stage>Seats himself at table .</stage>Now we 'll go quietly and methodically through the remainder ——<stage>Taking up a bill , looks at it , exclaims .</stage>Good heavens !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Good heavens what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p><stage>In a low exhausted tone with groans .</stage>Good heavens ! Good heavens ! It 's absolutely useless — Good heavens !</p>

    </sp>

     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p><stage>Points to bill .</stage>Four more hats ! Nine on the other bill — four more here . Thirteen hats .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>No , one was a toque .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>But can you explain ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Yes . You said yourself that Madame Récamier was horribly expensive , so I left her and went to Jacquelin 's — just to save your pocket ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>Never save my pocket again , please .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Very well , I wo n't .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>No , I daresay you wo n't , but I shall ! I shall draw the strings very tightly in future . Save my pocket !<stage>He is walking about distractedly .</stage><stage>Groans .</stage>Save my pocket .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Now , Harry , it 's useless to take it in this way — you knew when you married me I had n't got the money sense ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p><stage>Groans .</stage>I had n't got any sense at all !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Very likely not . But try and have a little now . What have I done ? Run a little into debt , solely to please you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>Yes ; well , now run out of it , and I shall be better pleased still .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>After all , running into debt is a positive virtue beside the things that some wives do !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>Oh , it 's a positive virtue , is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>A husband is very lucky when his wife spends most of her time running up a few bills . It keeps her out of mischief . I 'm sure you ought to feel very glad that I 'm a little extravagant !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I am ! I am ! I 'm delighted !</p>

     <p>Harry , you do n't mean that ? Oh , that 's absurd with our income !</p>

    <stage>She bursts into tears . He turns round and shows symptoms of relenting towards her , but steels himself and turns to the bills . She bursts into renewed tears . He goes on figuring .</stage>

    <stage>He turns and looks at her , is about to yield , but resists , turns away from her , settles resolutely to his figures .</stage>

     <p>And on the first night of the New Year , too ! Just as we were going to be so happy ! Harry !<stage>Holds out her arms appealingly .</stage>Harry !<stage>HARRY suddenly turns round and clasps her .</stage>How could you be so unkind to me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>Was I ? I did n't mean to be . Now ! Dry your tears , and help me reckon this up ——</p>

     <p>Ye-es .</p>

     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>At once , my darling — it 's getting late .</p>

     <p>Yes .<stage>Goes up to desk .</stage>You wo n't reproach me ?</p>

     <p>No , I 'm hanged if we ever shall !</p>

     <p>Oh , you will ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>Then I shall not be seen in the same street with you .</p>

     <p>What 's that to do with your bills ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>A great deal . That night at dinner she told you her dress allowance was a hundred and twenty a year , and you said you wished she 'd give me a few lessons in economy .</p>

     <p>I did not .</p>

     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>You did not ! I heard every word of your conversation , and you distinctly asked her to give me , your wife , a few lessons in economy .</p>

     <p>I 'll swear I did n't !</p>

     <p>That 's the one !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>I should call her a trifle lanky , Harry .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>A trifle ? Well , never mind ! You remember that dinner party ——</p>

     <p>You remember how she waited for a lull in the talk , and then she said with that silly , simpering , appealing look ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>Miss Smithson 's look is not silly or simpering .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Well , it 's appealing , is n't it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a little chuckle .</stage>Oh , yes , it 's appealing .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>She said with a very marked glance at me , “ My dress allowance is a hundred and twenty a year , and I do n't understand how any reasonable woman can wish for more ! ” What do you think of that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Well , if she did say that , and if she glanced at you , it ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Yes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>It was n't very nice of her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Nice ? It was an insult ! A direct , intentional , abominable insult , was n't it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes , decidedly , under the circumstances ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>And Harry ought to have resented it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>At his own dinner table he could n't , could he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Yes ! At least , if he could n't resent it , he ought to have shown that he resented it . Instead of that , he actually asked her to give me a few lessons in economy !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>I did not !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Pardon me , you did ! Me ! his wife ! Lessons in economy !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>And a thundering good thing if she had given you a few before you ran up these bills !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Dashes his hand on to the bills .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>There ! You hear ? !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Come , Harry , you ought n't to have asked another woman to give your wife lessons in economy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>I did n't !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Dad ! You were there ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Yes , but I do n't quite remember ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>You do n't remember ?! Surely you can remember a simple thing like that when your own daughter tells you it was so !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Now , Harry , what did you really say to Miss Smithson ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>I said she might give some women a lesson in economy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Not meaning Dolly ?</p>
    </sp>

     <p>No-o .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Then whom did he mean ? Lessons in economy ? Whom could he mean if he did n't mean me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>Just so !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Ah ! There ! You see , he owns it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>No , no , I 'm sure he does n't mean it ! Did you , Harry ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Winking at HARRY .</stage>
    <sp>

    <stage>SCENE : The same .</stage>
    <stage>TIME : Afternoon of January 1st , 1908 .</stage>
    <stage>Enter LUCAS , followed by CRIDDLE . LUCAS has his left collar-bone broken , and his arm is strapped across his breast ; his coat is buttoned loosely over the arm , the left sleeve hanging down .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>They 've gone to meet me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Criddle</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>By the road ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Criddle</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>That 's how I 've missed them . My car broke down the other side of the clump , and so I walked over the fields .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Criddle</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir . I beg pardon , I hope the arm is n't serious .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>No , Criddle . Just serious enough to get me a couple of months ’ leave , so that I could spend the New Year in England .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Criddle</speaker>
     <p>You had it very hot in India , I suppose , sir ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>Blazing !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Criddle</speaker>
     <p>We 've got the same old weather here , you see , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>Same old weather ! Had any visitors for Christmas , Criddle ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Criddle</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Barron , of course , and Professor and Mrs. Sturgess .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>Same old visitors — same visitors , I should say . Mr. Pilcher still Vicar here , I suppose ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Criddle</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir . He gave us a wonderful sermon at the old year 's service last night .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>Same old sermon !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Criddle</speaker>
     <p>No , sir . Not exactly the same sermon , though it had similar points to last year . Ah ! You came over for the old year 's service last year ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>Yes , and a rattling good sermon it was !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Criddle</speaker>
     <p>Very powerful and persuading , was n't it , sir ? It even touched me up a bit .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>In what way , Criddle ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Criddle</speaker>
     <p>I used to have my ten bob on any horse as I fancied , but I never put a farthing on anything — not even on Sulky Susan for the Oaks .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>You did n't ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Criddle</speaker>
     <p>No , and thank God , in a manner of speaking , that I did n't , for she never pulled it off . I owe that to Mr. Pilcher . No , I never touched a thing till the Leger . That reminds me ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>What , Criddle ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Criddle</speaker>
     <p>Why , last year , after Mr. Pilcher 's sermon , the master had a collecting box , and when he found himself going a bit off the straight he used to put in a shilling or half-a-crown for Mr. Pilcher 's blanket fund ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>Yes , of course ! And Uncle Matt promised him a sovereign for each of us if we had carried out our good resolutions . Is that coming off , Criddle ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Criddle</speaker>
     <p>I expect it is , sir . Mr. Pilcher is coming here this afternoon , and the master told me to be sure and find the box before he gets here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>Find the box ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Criddle</speaker>
     <p>Nobody has seen anything of it for some months . Excuse me , sir , I must look for it .<stage>Exit CRIDDLE .</stage>LUCAS takes out letter from an unsealed envelope , glances through it , sits at table , takes out pencil , adds a short note , puts letter in envelope , seals it up , puts it in his tail pocket , goes to conservatory , looks in . RENIE enters at door behind him . She starts , as he turns round .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a whisper .</stage>You 're here already ?</p>

     <p>Your wound ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>Much better . Nearly well .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p>I 'm so glad ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>I 'm not . I shall have to cut it back to India directly . Why did n't you answer my last letter ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p>I did — and tore it up .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>Tore it up ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p>What 's the use ? I told you last year we could never be anything to each other !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>But you did n't mean it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He seizes her hand and kisses it several times .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Feebly attempting to withdraw it .</stage>Yes — yes , I did . Hush !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p><stage>Shows her the letter .</stage>I want you to read this .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p><stage>Heard through the door which is open a few inches .</stage>Have you found the box , Criddle ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Criddle</speaker>
     <p>No , sir . I 've hunted everywhere .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Have another look . We must have it ready for Mr. Pilcher .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT enters</speaker>
     <p>Meantime RENIE has crept to upper conservatory door and gone off signing to LUCAS to keep silence . He has taken the letter out of his pocket and held it up for her to see , putting it back before MATT enters .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Ah , Lucas . So you 've got here . Happy New Year !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>

     <p>How 's the arm ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>Splendid — nearly well . Dolly and Harry all right ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>First rate . They 'll be here directly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>The Sturgesses are here again , Criddle tells me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Ye-es .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>Gray matter still going strong ?</p>

     <p>Booming .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>How 's Mrs. Sturgess ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>As usual , a little inclined to flop about and play act ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>Yes . Jolly good-looking woman though , eh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Very . Lucas ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>Well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>You 're quite cured , eh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>Cured ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Of your infatuation for her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>Infatuation ? Well , I admired her , and perhaps it was lucky I was ordered out to India ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>I managed that for you , my boy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>You did ! ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Sir John wanted a smart A. D. C ., so I drove over to Aldershot , urged your claims , and got you the appointment .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>So that was why I was packed off . It was you who ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Are n't you thankful I did ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>Yes , much obliged to you , much obliged !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>So you ought to be . And so 's the lady .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>Is she ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Yes . When we got your wire yesterday saying you 'd motor down to-day , Dolly had a long talk with her , and the result was she thanked Dolly and me for getting you out of the way and saving her from you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>Did she ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Yes , for twenty minutes . She kissed Dolly , and I think she would have kissed me , only I did n't feel myself quite worthy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>Oh , so that 's all settled !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>That 's all settled . At least , let 's hope so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>What do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Well , you wo n't come ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>What ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Why , the same old game !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>You must be judging me by yourself , when you were young .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>My dear boy , that 's just what I am doing . Lucas , there 's not going to be any repetition ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>No — no .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Because it is n't the right thing to do , is it ?</p>

     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Very well then , do n't do it !</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sorry your visit will be so short . CRIDDLE enters triumphantly with the hospital box which is very mouldy and dusty — he has also duster in his hand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Criddle</speaker>
     <p>I 've found him , sir —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Rather mouldy , eh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Where did you find him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Criddle</speaker>
     <p>In the wine-cellar , of all places ! I was getting out a bottle of the sixty-eight port for New Year 's night , and happening to put my hand behind , there he was !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p><stage>Has a sudden gesture of remembrance .</stage>Yes , I remember !</p>
    </sp>

     <p>What should incurables be doing in the wine-cellar ?<stage>Holds out his hand to CRIDDLE for the box . CRIDDLE , who has been holding it carefully , gives it to MATT . Exit CRIDDLE . MATT gives the box a shake . It rattles as if half full of coins . He shakes it again , more violently ; it rattles again .</stage>Internal organs sound healthy . How did he get into the wine-cellar , Harry ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>Well , Dolly and I had been having a little tiff one morning — nothing serious ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>No . When was that ?</p>

     <p>March , was n't it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>May , I think ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>No , it was n't that one — Well , never mind , I got so riled at Dolly always poking this box in front of me whenever I happened to — so I thought the wine-cellar would be the safest place for it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gives it another rattle .</stage>Well , here he is , turned up just at the right moment ! And here you all are , Dolly , Harry , Lucas , Mrs. Sturgess — all clamouring for me to redeem my promise and put in a sovereign for each of you . CRIDDLE appears at door announcing MR. PILCHER . PILCHER enters with four oblong brown paper parcels of equal size . Exit CRIDDLE .</p>

     <p>It was a bona fide bargain on my side , but if you wish to avoid any awkward little exposures , or if Mr. Pilcher will kindly waive his claims to my contributions ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pilcher</speaker>
     <p>I 'm afraid I can n't . I have come here for the express purpose of bearing away my trophy — Ah !<stage>Seeing box on table , takes it , gives it a shake ; his features assume a pleasant smile .</stage>It seems to have proved a very wholesome household regulator .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>Yes , by Jove ! It had n't been in the house twenty-four hours before I put in a sovereign .</p>

     <p>A sovereign ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>The first night of last year Dolly and I had a little tiff — nothing serious — and so the next morning I made it up and — did n't I , Dolly ?——</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>You did ! And paid my bills like a lamb , you dear !</p>

     <p>Not at all . We were just about to settle the question Mr. Barron raised last New Year 's day ——</p>

     <p>Oh , yes ; I remember ! Curiously enough I have only this morning received the proofs of my new volume , “ Free Will , the Illusion . ”</p>

    <stage>Showing the proofs to PILCHER .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pilcher</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pilcher</speaker>
     <p>I should like to look through those sheets , but ——</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Glancing at MATT .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p>You shall ! I have put the whole argument into the concrete case of Sarah Mumford ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pilcher</speaker>
     <p>Sarah Mumford ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p>The baby farmer ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Sarah 's gray matter gone watery ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p>Not watery , but she had a yellow effusion ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>I suppose that 's just as bad ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p>Quite .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>What did they do with her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p>They hanged her . They then discovered extensive lesions and this yellow effusion ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Pity they did n't discover that before they hanged her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p>My exact point ! Where is the justice of punishing a woman whose gray matter functions perversely ? It is nothing short of a crime .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>But she had suffocated five dear little babies ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>How could she avoid suffocating babies if she had a yellow effusion in her brain ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p>Precisely my argument ——</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Puts his proofs into MATT 'S hands . Points out a passage . MATT , a little embarrassed , takes them , looks through them .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p>The point I wish to establish is this . While we all allow that extensive or recognizable diseases of , or injuries to , the brain , free a man from responsibility and punishment , how can we logically mete out blame or praise , punishment or reward to our ordinary acts , thoughts , and impulses , seeing that all our acts , thoughts , and impulses , good or bad , virtuous or criminal , are equally the mere expressions of certain inevitable physical changes in the brain , the mere register on the dial plate of consciousness of necessary predetermined complications in the working of certain atoms of the gray matter of our cortex ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Quite so ! Quite so !<stage>DOLLY is about to speak , but MATT hushes her down with a warning look and sign .</stage>The Professor wants to say with Socrates that no man would be such a fool as to do wrong , if he could possibly help it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p>Well , if you like to put it that way ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pilcher</speaker>
     <p>And now perhaps we might proceed . Can you remember the exact terms , Mr. Barron ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>I am to pay a sovereign for everyone of your hearers who has so far benefited by the wise admonitions of your last year 's sermon as to have broken off his bad habits , or some especial bad habit ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>We are n't bound to say what the habit is that we 've broken off ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>I do n't wish to be inquisitive , but if you do n't mention the particular bad habit , you will have to give me your word of honor that you 've conquered it .<stage>Putting down proofs on table , taking up the money-box , giving it a shake .</stage><stage>Looking round .</stage>Now , who will be first to step into the confessional ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>I will . As I 've nothing to confess .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Nothing ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>No . I had what some husbands might think a bad habit , but ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>No bills this Christmas , eh , Doll ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>You 're sure now , my darling ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>None of any importance .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>What do you mean of any importance ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Well , you must have some bills — they grow up before you know — such as Doctors ’ bills — you can n't settle them all on the spur of the moment , but I 've nothing — nothing of importance . So please put in your sovereign for me , Dad , and look pleasant about it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>You declare upon your word of honor that you have broken off your bad habit of running up bills ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Entirely ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Yes . You said you would n't be inquisitive .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Yes , but ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pilcher</speaker>
     <p>Mrs. Telfer has given her word . I think I may claim one victory for free will ,<stage>nodding victoriously at the PROFESSOR who shakes his head</stage>, and one sovereign for the Blanket Club .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Hum !<stage>Draws a sovereign out of his pocket and very reluctantly drops it into the box , shakes his head at DOLLY who looks a little uncomfortable .</stage>Who volunteers next ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p>I do . No — I 'll wait a little — I want to make sure that I am perfectly honest with myself and with everybody .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>That perhaps may need a little consideration , Lucas ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>Oh , let Harry have his doing first !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Now , Harry !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>Oh , well , here goes ! I 'm going to make a clean breast . The fact is I 've made a thundering mess of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Ah !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>I did begin all right except for a little tiff with Dolly — and then I kept on pretty well for some time , and then — well I do n't know — I seemed to go all to pieces and —<stage>MATT rattles the money-box .</stage>However , better luck this year .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pilcher</speaker>
     <p>Shall we say a little more resolution ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I mean to pull myself together this year .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps you tried too much reforming , Harry — too many irons in the fire , eh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>Well , it 's jolly hard to keep it up . And I 'd got pretty slack till you woke us up last night — I say , that was a rouser again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pilcher</speaker>
     <p>It was n't a very bad sermon , was it ? Well now for the next year shall we make one especial effort in one especial direction — Say ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Temper , eh , Harry ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>Right , old girl ! Oh , I mean it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>No victory for free will , and the Blanket Club , this time . Game and game , eh ? Now which of you two ——</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Looking at RENIE and LUCAS .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p>I 'll be your first victim .<stage>Coming into the middle of the room , and posing .</stage>It 's so strange that what you started as a jest ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Oh no , in deadly earnest I assure you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p>In this life who knows what is jest and what is earnest ? The least little innocent thing may turn to a tragedy in a moment ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Surely you have n't had any little tragedies ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p>No , last year a mere little circumstance might have turned to a tragedy — honestly I was n't to blame , but perhaps I was a little careless , and two dear friends came to me with their counsel , and what might have been a tragedy was turned to a comedy , thanks to those two dear friends !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p>My dear , may I ask “ what circumstance ” you are alluding to ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>We said we would n't be inquisitive ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p>No , but I cannot recall anything in my wife 's life during the last twelve months that even approached a tragedy ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p>I said the affair was quite unimportant ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p>Then I wish , my dear , you would n't magnify everything , and I wish you would read solid scientific works in place of rubbishy French novels — and above all , take a little more regular exercise !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps Mrs. Sturgess may consider that little point during the coming year . Meantime ,<stage>To RENIE</stage>may we be confident your little tragedy is ended ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p>Oh yes , quite .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>We need n't ask its nature , but you give us your word of honor ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Looks at her very searchingly and speaking seriously .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p>Yes , my word of honor .</p>

     <p><stage>Coming cheerfully forward .</stage>My turn for the thumbscrew !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>You seem very cheerful about it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I 'm going to make a jolly good show .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>What particular bad habit have you conquered during the past year ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know that I 've conquered any one in particular , but I 've had a regular good go in all round , so altogether I can pat myself on the back .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>But I want to know one particular habit conquered — for instance , you were n't very careful what ladies you made love to , or how many of them at the same time ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>I say , Uncle Matt , drop this ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>And a year or two ago you went just a little bit off the straight ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>Oh no I did n't .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>I want to know ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>Thank you , no more thumbscrew . I 'm out of this before it goes any further .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>It is n't going any further .<stage>Putting his hand on LUCAS 'S shoulder .</stage>Give me your word of honor ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>That 's all very well , it was n't a very bad case , and I do n't think you should have brought it up . But as you have — well , I did meet a lady , and I was very much attracted to her , but I summoned all my resolution , and there the matter ended .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pilcher</speaker>
     <p>I think I may claim a victory here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>So please put in your sovereign .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p><stage>Very seriously .</stage>If you will give me your word of honor that you have absolutely broken off ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Lucas</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes , of course I have .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MATT puts in a sovereign , hands the box to PILCHER .</stage>

Most satisfactory .<stage>Taking out watch .</stage>I must hurry off to the White House and see what they 're doing there .<stage>Rattling the box .</stage>Excellent results ! So excellent that I think I 'm justified in making you a little New Year 's gift .</p>

     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>A New Year 's gift ! How kind of you ! To me ?</p>

     <speaker>Pilcher</speaker>
     <p><stage>Opening his parcel .</stage>To you and your husband . To your husband in particular , because , although he may have fallen a little short of perfection during the last year — like some of the rest of us — yet I feel sure that during this coming year —<stage>They have all been watching him curiously ; he has now opened the parcel and displays a very bright brand new collecting box , with Crookbury Blanket Club painted on it , in large letters . It is much larger than the hospital box .</stage><stage>Giving it to DOLLY .</stage>My household regulator !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p><stage>Who has shown considerable disappointment on the opening of the parcel .</stage>Crookbury Blanket Club ! Thank you so much , for Harry 's sake . Harry ! For you , dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She gives the box to HARRY , who places it on the same table .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>You call it the household regulator ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pilcher</speaker>
     <p>Yes — I have suggested it to several of my brethren . Oh , its use will become very general throughout the diocese .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>You think it will work well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pilcher</speaker>
     <p>It cannot fail . A box of this character — larger or smaller , according to the size of the family and their behaviour is left at each house on the first of the year . All little failings , peccadilloes , and asperities are strictly fined . The inevitable result is that either the family behaviour improves , or the parish charities benefit . I 'm starting its operation in my parish to-day . Forgive any inexcusable rudeness in leaving the first box with you . I must hurry off !<stage>Shaking hands .</stage>Good-bye , Professor .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p>I should like to make that point clear with regard to free will ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Pilcher</speaker>
     <p>When you have an hour , or shall I say a year , to spare , we might argue it out ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p>You 're going to the White House ? If I might accompany you ——</p>

     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p>Renie , you 've had your restless fits again . You 'd better come with us ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p>But I 've already been walking ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p>My dear , this bracing country air is just what you need . Keep out in it all the day long ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p>Oh , very well — the White House , and the fish-pond as usual , I suppose ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p>As usual . Come along .</p>

     <p>Doll , you really have n't got any bills this year ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>No ! no ! Only the few little oddments that no woman can prevent .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>You might let me see the little oddments ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>I will .<stage>Suddenly .</stage>Oh Harry , I quite forgot ! Do forgive me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>What ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>I never wrote the geyser bath people !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>Never mind the geyser bath .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>And only this morning you rowed me because I had n't got it ready for the New Year ! Where did you put their address ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know ! Somewhere upstairs among my papers .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gently pushing him off .</stage>I can just catch to-night 's post ! Make haste and get it ! Quick ! There 's a dear ! And then we can get the bath fixed up for you next week .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harry</speaker>
     <p>Ye — es . I say , Doll , I mean to get those oddments fixed up to-night .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Taps the writing-case significantly and exit . DOLLY looks frightened , sees him off , goes up to writing-desk , takes out bills , looks at them , throws up her arms in despair , groans , slams down the writing-desk , looks at the chair she has touched in first act , shows great resolution , marches up and touches it .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Yes ! Yes ! I have got free will .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Goes back from it , again looks at it , again marches up to it , touches it .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Then why do I keep on having bills ? RENIE enters in great agitation and distress .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Dolly !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>What 's the matter ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Dolly !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>What is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Throws her arms round DOLLY affectionately .</stage>You 've always been such a true friend to me ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Yes , dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p>More like a sister . And I know I may trust you now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p><stage>A little suspicious .</stage>Yes . Has anything happened ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p>Yes . Oh , Dolly ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Tell me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p>As we were going out at the garden gate , Captain Wentworth held out a letter behind his back for me to take ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>What ? !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p>But now his arm is wounded he could n't manage it properly , and he dropped it . I hurried to pick it up , and then my husband noticed and insisted on reading it ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>What was in the letter ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p>It was n't so very bad , but my husband has chosen to jump to a wrong conclusion , and — oh , Dolly , you can help me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coldly , relaxing her embrace .</stage>How ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p>If you 'd only let me tell my husband that I was receiving it for you ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>What ? !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p>There was no address , and fortunately it was so worded that it showed that you were n't really guilty .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Oh ! I was n't really guilty ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p>In fact , it proves your complete innocence .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>I 'm glad of that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p>Then you 'll let me say it was you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>No ! You can n't suppose I should let my own cousin make love to me in my own house ? !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p>You wo n't help me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Yes , any way but that ! How could you be so foolish ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know . When I heard yesterday he was coming , I quite made up my mind I 'd have nothing to say to him ! Dolly , free will must be an illusion , or else why am I always doing the things I do n't mean to do . Oh , what shall I do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>As you are completely innocent , you 'd better ask your husband to forgive you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p>Ye — es . No ! As it is a perfectly pure and exalted attachment I shall take that ground — at any rate at first , and see what he says . You 'll help me all you can ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Yes , but promise me you 'll have nothing to do with Lucas in future !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p>No , indeed ! if I once get out of this .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Very well ! I 'll see what I can do .— Hush ! The PROFESSOR enters with a letter in his hand , MATT soothing him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p><stage>Very angry .</stage>Not a word more , if you please . Mrs. Telfer , you have doubtless heard ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Yes ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p>I leave for London to-night-to consult my lawyer . Mrs. Sturgess will , I trust , return to her friends until ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps Mrs. Sturgess may be able to explain ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p>What explanation can be offered of language like this .<stage>Reading from letter .</stage>“ From the first moment I saw you , I felt that you were entirely different from any woman I have ever met —— ” A monstrously inexact statement to start with . And a woman who is capable of practising such deceit ——</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>RENIE bursts into tears .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>I think you ought to hear what Mrs. Sturgess has to say ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Renie</speaker>
     <p><stage>Through her tears .</stage>What would be the use ? With such a nature as his he could never begin to understand the loyal and exalted devotion which Captain Wentworth feels for me ! No , all my life I have been misunderstood , misjudged , condemned ! Let it be so till the end ! Dolly , come and help me pack !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Exit . MATT goes up to table and takes up proofs of PROFESSOR 'S book and looks through them .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>You 're really too severe with poor Renie ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p>I am not severe . I simply register the inevitable sentence of the husband upon the wife who misconducts herself !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Misconducts herself ! She has merely had a little harmless flirtation ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p>In my wife a flirtation of this character<stage>pointing to letter in his hand</stage>constitutes grave misconduct .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>But that 's perfectly ridiculous ! Why it might happen to any woman ! Dad , explain to him ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Professor , you 're taking altogether a wrong view of this . Now this case you were pointing out to me in your own book<stage>pointing to proofs</stage>— Number forty-nine , Mrs. Copway . Remarkably handsome woman too !—<stage>reading</stage>“ The injustice and cruelty of condemning this poor lady must be apparent to all . ” My dear Professor , before publishing this book you 'll have to modify your theory .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p>I cannot modify my theory . I have spent ten years in collecting facts which prove it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Then , pardon me , you must really look over Mrs. Sturgess 's little indiscretion .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p>That is equally impossible ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>But you say that her action in receiving my nephew 's letter was entirely due to the activity of certain atoms in the gray matter of her brain .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p>Undoubtedly that is so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Very well then , if her gray matter keeps on working wrong , what 's the use of blaming her ? You say yourself there 's no such thing as free will ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p>Precisely , but I have always allowed that in the present low moral and intellectual condition of the herd of mankind , free will is a plausible working hypothesis .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>But it does n't work ! Free will wo n't work at all ! Look at my own case ! Do you suppose I should go on all my life having bills if I could help myself ?<stage>Catching MATT 'S eye , who looks at her gravely and holds up his finger .</stage>Never mind my bills ! Do make him see how wrong and absurd it is to punish poor Renie when there 's no such thing as free will !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Dolly 's right ! She 's only saying what you have so admirably laid down here . My dear Professor , you cannot possibly publish this book !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p>But it has been announced ! I must publish it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>You cannot . Read that .<stage>Giving the PROFESSOR the book and pointing out passage .</stage>Surely after that you cannot condemn Mrs. Sturgess .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taking book , glancing at the passage .</stage>Really , it 's most annoying when one 's own wife upsets ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>Oh ! they 're always making hay of our theories one way or the other .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p>Of course , if one presses the matter home to first principles ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Yes ! Yes ! Well , why not act on your own first principles ! You ought to be very sorry for poor Renie , considering all she has suffered .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p>Suffered ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Yes , poor dear ! You do n't know what an awful struggle she has gone through between this unfortunate flirtation and her admiration for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p>Her admiration for me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Yes ! She always speaks of you as her great protagonist of science .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p><stage>Mollified .</stage>Does she ? Does she ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Yes . If I were you I should go upstairs , and be very sweet to her , and above all do n't reproach her . We women can endure anything except reproaches ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking at his proofs .</stage>I must publish my book . And after all , as you say , it is useless to blame them for acting according to the ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>The dictates of their gray matter when , bless them , they can n't help themselves . My dear Professor , instead of condemning your wife you ought to be condoling with her , and doing all you can to get her gray matter into a healthy condition .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p>I will hear what she has to say .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>No . Go straight to her and forgive her , and then I 'm sure her gray matter will soon be all right . And what a triumph that will be for you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Prof</speaker>
     <p><stage>Exit .</stage>It does offer a way out of the difficulty . In any case I must publish my book .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Dolly</speaker>
     <p>Dad , I wo n't have her here next Christmas .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>Matt</speaker>
     <p>No , my dear , I would n't .</p>

    <stage>DOLLY utters a contemptuous exclamation .</stage>
