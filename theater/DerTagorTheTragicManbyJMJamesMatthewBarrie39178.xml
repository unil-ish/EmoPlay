    <p>Your Imperial Majesty ——</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
    <p>Sire —— EMPEROR<stage>the EMPEROR rises</stage>Is that the paper ?<stage>Indicating a paper in the CHANCELLOR 'S hand .</stage>CHANCELLOR<stage>presenting it</stage>It awaits only your Imperial Majesty 's signature .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
    <p>When you have signed that paper , Sire , the Fatherland will be at war with France and Russia .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>At last , this little paper ——</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CHANCELLOR</speaker>
    <p>Not of the value of a bird 's feather until it has your royal signature . The ——</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>Then it will sing round the planet . The vibration of it will not pass in a hundred years . My friend , how still the world has grown since I raised this pen ! All Europe 's listening . Europe ! That 's Germany , when I have signed ! And yet ——</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
    <p>Your Imperial Majesty is not afraid to sign ? EMPEROR<stage>flashing</stage>Afraid ! OFFICER<stage>abject</stage>Oh , Sire !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>I am irresistible to-day ! “ Red blood boils in my veins . To me every open door is the gift of a world ! I hear a thousand nightingales ! I would eat all the elephants in Hindustan and pick my teeth with the spire of Strassburg Cathedral . ”</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
    <p>That is the Fatherland to-day . Such as we are , that you have made us , each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat his deity . It was you fashioned us into a sword , Sire , and now the sword must speak . EMPEROR<stage>approvingly</stage>There the sword spoke — and yet the wise one said : “ Take not your enemies together , but separately , lest the meal go to them instead of to you . ” One at a time .<stage>To CHANCELLOR</stage>Why am I not a friend of Russia till France is out of the way , or France 's friend until the bear is muzzled ? That was your part .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CHANCELLOR</speaker>
    <p>For that I strove , but their mean minds suspected me . Sire , your signature !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>What of Britain ? OFFICER<stage>intently</stage>This — The Day , to which we have so often drunk , draws near !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>The Day ! To The Day !</l>
     <stage>All salute The Day with their swords .</stage>
     <l>But when ?</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
    <p>Now , if she wants it !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>There is no road to Britain — until our neighbors are subdued . Then , for us , there will be no roads that do not lead to Britain . CHANCELLOR<stage>suavely</stage>Your Imperial Majesty , Britain will not join in just now .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>If I was sure of that !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CHANCELLOR</speaker>
    <p>I vouch for it . So well we 've chosen our time , it finds her at issue with herself , her wild women let loose , her colonies ready to turn against her , Ireland aflame , the paltry British Army sulking with the civic powers .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>These wounds might heal suddenly if German bugles sounded . It is a land that in the past has done things .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>In the past , your Imperial Majesty , but in the past alone lies</l>
     <l>Britain 's greatness .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>Yes , that 's the German truth . Britain has grown dull and sluggish ; a belly of a land , she lies overfed ; no dreams within her such as keep powers alive — and timid , too — without red blood in her , but in its stead a thick , yellowish fluid . The most she 'll play for is her own safety . Pretend to grant her that and she 'll seek her soft bed again . Britain 's part in the world 's making is done . “ I was , ” her epitaph .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CHANCELLOR</speaker>
    <p>How well you know her , Sire ! All she needs is some small excuse for saying , “ I acted in the best interests of my money-bags . ” That excuse I 've found for her . I have promised in your name a secret compact with her , that if she stands aloof the parts of France we do not at present need we will not at present take .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>A secret bargain over the head of France , her friend ! Surely an infamous proposal .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CHANCELLOR</speaker>
    <p>The British Government will not think so . Trust me to know them , Sire . Your signature ? EMPEROR<stage>gleaming</stage>I can fling a million men within the week across the border by way of Alsace and Lorraine . OFFICER<stage>with a frown</stage>There are a hundred gates to open that way .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>My guns shall open them . OFFICER<stage>with meaning</stage>You can think of no easier road , Sire ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>I think of it night and day .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
    <p>One further north — through Belgium ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>If I could dare ! But no , that road is barred . OFFICER<stage>misunderstanding</stage>On the contrary , Sire ——</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>Barred by a fortress no gun of mine may bear against — by honor , by my plighted word .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Yet , Sire ——</l>
     <l>EMPEROR</l>
     <stage>after hesitating</stage>
     <l>No , no ! I will not so stain my name .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CHANCELLOR</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>I am with you , Sire , but I fear it will not be so with</l>
     <l>France . She has grown cynical . She will find the road through Belgium .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>You seek to tempt me . She also signed the treaty .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CHANCELLOR</speaker>
    <p>Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself . I have private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CHANCELLOR</speaker>
    <p>She will say that necessity knows no law , or some such dastard words .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>Belgium is no craven . She will fight the betrayer .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CHANCELLOR</speaker>
    <p>France will hack her way through her .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>My Chancellor , that is a hideous phrase .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CHANCELLOR</speaker>
    <p>I ask your pardon , Sire . It came , somehow , pat to my lips .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
    <p>Your Imperial Majesty , the time passes . Will it please you to sign ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CHANCELLOR</speaker>
    <p>Bonaparte would have acted quickly .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>Bonaparte !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CHANCELLOR</speaker>
    <p>The paper , Sire .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>Leave it now with me . Return in an hour and you shall have it signed . OFFICER<stage>warningly</stage>The least delay ——</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CHANCELLOR</speaker>
    <p>Overmuch reflection ——</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>I wish to be alone .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>They retire respectfully , but anxious . He is left alone in thought .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>Even a King 's life is but a day , and in his day the sun is only at its zenith once . This is my zenith ; others will come to Germany , but not to me . The world pivots on me to-night . They said Bonaparte , coupling me with him . To dim Napoleon ! Paris in three weeks — say four , to cover any chance miscalculation ; Russia on her back in six , with Poland snapping at her , and then , after a breathing space , we reach — The Day ! We sweep the English Channel , changing its name as we embark , and cross by way of Calais , which will have fallen easily into our hands , the British fleet destroyed — for that is part of the plan — Dover to London is a week of leisured marching , and London itself , unfortified and panic-stricken , falls in a day ! Vae victis ! I 'll leave conquered Britain some balls to play with , so that there shall be no uprising . Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my colonists , for now I strike the seas . It 's all so docketed . I feel it 's as good as done before I set forth to do it . Dictator of the world ! And all for pacific ends . For once , the whole is mine . We come at last to the great desideratum , a universal peace . Rulers over all ! God in the heavens , I upon the earth — we two !<stage>Raising his brows threateningly</stage>And there are still the Zeppelins ! I 'll sign !</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>He sits in thought . He is very tired , and soon he is asleep . The lighting becomes strange ; he dreams , and we see his dream . The SPIRIT OF CULTURE appears , a noble female figure in white robes .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>Who 's that ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CULTURE</speaker>
    <p>A friend . I am Culture , who has so long hovered well-placed over happy Germany . EMPEROR<stage>who gives her royal honor</stage>A friend — a consort ! I would hear you say , O Queen , that I have done some things for you .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CULTURE</speaker>
    <p>You have done much for me . I have held my head higher since you were added to the roll of sovereigns . I may have smiled at you at times , as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one , but as Kings go you have been a worthy King .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>It was all done for you .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CULTURE</speaker>
    <p>So , for long , I thought . I looked upon Germany 's golden granaries , plucked from ground once barren ; its busy mills and furnaces , its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble seats of learning , all mellowing in the sun , and I heard you say they were dedicate to me , and I was proud . You have honored me , my Emperor , and now I am here to be abased by you . All the sweet garments you have robed me in , tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>You would not have me sign ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CULTURE</speaker>
    <p>I warn you first to know yourself , you who have gloated in a looking-glass too long .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>I sign , so that Germany may be greater still , to spread your banner farther ; thus I make the whole world cultured .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CULTURE</speaker>
    <p>My banner needs no such spreading . It has ever been your weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany . I have many homes , and the fairest is in France .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>If that were true , Germany would care less for you .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CULTURE</speaker>
    <p>If that is true , I have never had a home in Germany . I am no single nation 's servant , no single race 's Queen . I am not of German make . My banner is already in every land on which you would place your heel . Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom . I 'll not have you say you fight for me . Find some other reason .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>The jealousies of nations ——</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CULTURE</speaker>
    <p>All are guilty there . Jealousy , not love of money , is the root of all evil ; that was a misprint . Yet I know of nothing those others want that is yours to give , save peace . What do you want of them ? Bites out of each , and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry : “ The blood be on their heads ; they force me into war . ”</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>Germany must expand . That is her divine mission ; I have it from on high .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CULTURE</speaker>
    <p>Your system of espionage is known to be tolerably complete .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>All Germany is with me . I hold in leash the mightiest machine for war the world has forged .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CULTURE</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>I have seen your legions , and all are with you . Never was a</l>
     <l>Lord more trusted . O Emperor , does that not make you pause ?</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>France invades little Belgium .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CULTURE</speaker>
    <p>Chivalrous France ! Never ! Emperor , I leave one last word to you at the parting of the ways . France , Russia , Britain , these are great opponents , but it is not they will bring the pillars of Germany down . Beware of Belgium !</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>She goes . He is left in two minds . He crosses to sign . He flings down the pen . He strikes the bell . CHANCELLOR and OFFICER reappear .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CHANCELLOR</speaker>
    <p>Your Imperial Majesty has signed ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>Thus<stage>he tears the paper</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
    <p>Sire !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>Say this to Russia , France , and Britain in my Imperial name : So long as they keep within their borders I remain in mine .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
    <p>But , Sire ——</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>You know , as I do , that it is all they ask for .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CHANCELLOR</speaker>
    <p>You were the friend of Austria .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>I 'll prove it . Tell her from me that Servia has yielded on every point which doth become a nation and that Austria may accept her terms .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CHANCELLOR</speaker>
    <p>Nay , Sire ——</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>And so , there will be no war .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
    <p>Sire , we beg ——</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>These are my commands .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>They have to go , chagrined , but deferential .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>The decision lay with me , and I said there shall be peace . That be my zenith !</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>He goes back to the chair ; he sleeps peacefully ; in the distance a bell tolls the Angelus , and suddenly this is broken by one boom of a great gun , which reverberates and should be startling . The SPIRIT OF CULTURE returns , now with a wound in her breast ; she surveys him sadly .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CULTURE</speaker>
    <p>Sleep on , unhappy King .<stage>He grows restless .</stage>Better to wake if even your dreams appal you .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>He wakes , and for a moment he scarcely understands that he has been dreaming ; the realization is tragic to him .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>You ! You have come here to mock me !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CULTURE</speaker>
    <p>Oh , no .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>I dreamed there was no war . In my dream they came to me and I forbade the war . I saw the Fatherland smiling and prosperous , as it was before the war .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CULTURE</speaker>
    <p>It was you who made the war , O Emperor ! EMPEROR<stage>huskily</stage>Belgium ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CULTURE</speaker>
    <p>There is no Belgium now , but over what was Belgium there rests a soft light , as of a helm , and through it is a flaming sword .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>I dreamed I had kept my plighted word to Belgium .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CULTURE</speaker>
    <p>It was you , O Emperor , who broke your plighted word and laid waste the land . In the lust for victory you violated even the laws of war which men contrive so that when the sword is sheathed they may dare again face their Maker . Your way to Him is lighted now by smouldering spires and ashes that were once fair academic groves of mine , and you shall seek Him over roads cobbled with the moans of innocents .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
    <p>In my dream I thought England was grown degenerate and would not fight .</p>
   </sp>
