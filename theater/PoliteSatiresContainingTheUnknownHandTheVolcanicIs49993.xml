    <p>SCENE . A Room in JULIET 'S Flat . Back centre , a fire . To its right , a chair ; to its left , an easy chair and a small table . Two envelopes and a new novel lie on the table . JULIET is seated in the easy chair , looking into the fire .</p>
   </set>
   <titlePage>
    <docImprint>JULIET ( dreamily ) . Hans Andersen , when he was old and frail , Said that his life had been a fairy-tale .... ( Looking up . ) That 's what mine is ! Think of it — by a freak Of Fortune to be famous in one week , And with my first book ! Would it have made quite Such a commotion had I dared to write Under my name ? Who knows ? But if you 've penned A merciless portrait of your dearest friend , You simply can n't avow it . And a book That bears a man 's name has a weightier look Somehow . My novel ! Why , it seems an age Since last I gloated on the title-page . ( She takes up the novel from the table . ) ‘ The Strong Man 's Library . Number Seventeen . “ Calypso and Her Loves , ” by Galahad Green . Second Impression . ’ Then down there , quite small . The modest publishers — Chapman and Hall . ( Turning to the envelopes on the table . ) Oh , and they 've sent me — Is it from Chapman ? Yes — Another batch of cuttings from the Press . Quite a lot , too ! I 'll give them just a glance Before I go to supper . ( Taking the envelope which is on top , she extracts a number of Press cuttings , looks through them hastily and tosses them back on to the table one by one . )</docImprint>
    <epigraph>
     <p>‘ True romance . ’ W. J. Turner — ‘ Shows a man 's desire To write for men .... Much promise . ’ J. C . Squire .— ‘ At times like Gosse .... ’ Who wrote that ? Squire again , But in a different paper — ‘ Stuff for men .... Gosse-like at moments . ’ Edward Shanks — ‘ No learner , A finished craftsman . ’ W. J. Turner — ‘ Impressive . ’ J. C . Squire .— ‘ His novel ranks Among the best books of the season .... ’ Shanks .— ‘ Impressive . ’ Shanks .— ‘ Almost the true Gosse fire .... ’ Turner again . ‘ A man 's book . ’ J. C . Squire .— My poor head swims ! How very queer to find Ten papers , three reviewers and one mind . They 're like the Isle of Man . Suppose I beg Prettily ? Would they make me their fourth leg ? Here 's praise enough . Indeed , you 'd think I knew them — Or that they hoped I might in turn review them . ( Looking again at the table , she picks up the second envelope . )</p>
    </epigraph>
    <docImprint>And here ? Oh , horror ! Helen 's writing — hers , I 'm sure , and what wild spluttering characters ! Their wildness might be due to haste , but not The Maenad fury of that final blot . She 's read the book , and recognized with rage The portrait of herself on every page , In every line . She could n't miss it . Why Did n't I make Calypso small and shy , Dark and not fair ? Whatever made me draw Helen complete , even to her slightest flaw ? Everything 's there — green eyes , the Chelsea flat , The craze for Morny bath-salts , even that !... I let Calypso live at such a pace Too , that I dare n't look Helen in the face , I simply dare n't . But stay ! She might have seen The book : she can n't think I am Galahad Green . There 's hope . I 'll soon see what she has to say .... ( She opens the letter . ) ‘ My dearest Juliet ’ — ‘ dearest , ’ anyway !— ‘ I 'm furious , but I sha n't say what about Until we meet . Promise you wo n't be out This evening . I shall call at eight o'clock . Helen . ’ At least her letter saves the shock Of meeting unprepared , and I 'll be able To sweep these wretched cuttings from the table What is the time ? Exactly eight . Oh dear , At any minute now she may be here Storming my ears off . What a risk I took ! And then — she 's just the girl to read a book , Find her own portrait there , done all too well , And taxi-ing to the publishers pell-mell Demand to have the author 's home-address . Chapman and Hall , however great their stress , Would never give it , would they ? When we met Their manager seemed such a perfect pet .... ( A bell rings . Noise outside . ) There she is . ( HELEN rushes in — still wearing her furs . ) HELEN ( dramatically ) . Juliet ! JULIET . Well , what 's wrong , my dear ? HELEN . Nothing — at least — I am so glad you 're here . ( She takes both of JULIET 'S hands . ) JULIET . I read your letter just in time . The fact Is that it caught me in the very act Of going out to supper . HELEN . But you 'll stay Now ? It 's important — what I 've come to say — And yet so horrible that I 've scarce the heart To speak of it . I do n't know how to start . JULIET . I guess . You 've jilted John ! I always said You would . Or has he jilted you instead ? HELEN ( breaking ) . Oh , do n't be flippant , Juliet . Ca n't you see It 's not a laughing matter ? Should I be In such a state about a love-affair ? I 'm not pre-Shaw . JULIET . Then why —— HELEN . As if I 'd care Because John tried to leave me . He 'll as soon Do that as find an oil-field in the moon . No — this is something serious . JULIET . Wo n't you take Your furs off , and sit down ? HELEN . For goodness ’ sake Do n't vex me with that calm superior tone ! Once you were sympathetic , but you 've grown More and more selfish every month . Of late I 've hardly seen you . Now I come here straight From being insulted , being driven half-mad , By some sly undiscoverable cad , And there you sit , impassive and content , Like Middle-Age upon a monument Smiling at grief . JULIET . I do n't flare up like you , Helen . But wait ! I 've been insulted , too . HELEN . Really ? But listen ! If I keep it back A minute more , it means a nerve-attack . Juliet — I 've read a book —— JULIET . A novel ? HELEN . Yes — A new one . But however did you guess ? It 's only just out . JULIET . Surely you can n't mean —— HELEN ( holding up a copy ) . ‘ Calypso and Her Loves ’ ! JULIET ( doing likewise ) . By Galahad Green ! Now , that 's extraordinary — the very same ! HELEN . You 've read it ? Oh , it makes me blush for shame . JULIET . Stick by me — even now . I know you will . HELEN . What ? I ? Dear Juliet , you can love me still ! JULIET . To see them set down — all one 's little tricks .... HELEN . To have one 's soul supplied at eight-and-six .... JULIET . Or hired from Mudie 's , read by every clerk — HELEN . And every sniggering waitress after dark . JULIET . I could have stood a mere divorce . But this ! HELEN . Every one must know who Calypso is . JULIET . Of course . I simply dare n't be seen about . HELEN . Who is this Galahad Green ? I can n't find out . JULIET . A blood-sucker , a literary flea ! HELEN . I 'll sue the cad for libel . Just you see ! JULIET . You dear ! It ought to be my action , though . HELEN . Yours ? You can n't mind as much as I , you know . JULIET . Ca n't I ! You think I 'd stay in<country>England</country>now ? HELEN . What ? Leave your home ? No , that I can n't allow . JULIET . Wo n't you come , too ? To-morrow I shall start . HELEN . Of course you 're sweet to take it so to heart — JULIET . Who would n't — with her reputation gone ? HELEN . It must be such a bitter pill for John ! JULIET . What would John care because I 'm painted black ? HELEN . You ? JULIET . In this book , this dastardly attack — Yet , you dear noble girl , at least it 's shown That to you my misfortunes are your own . HELEN . Juliet — what do you mean ? Sometimes your gibes Are most ill-timed . You know the book describes Me . JULIET . You 're not serious ? HELEN . I ? Of course I am .... And now that I 've discovered what a sham You were with all your sympathy , I could hurl The foul book at your head . You heartless girl ! Is this a time to mock me , to pretend You care so much about your slandered friend That you wo n't stay in<country>England</country>? If that 's your Notion of fun , it is n't mine , be sure . JULIET . I was n't being funny — not a bit , Really . It 's simply that the cap does fit — I am Calypso ! HELEN . Well , I never heard Such nonsense in my life . It 's too absurd . Oh , if I could but think that one or two Readers might fancy it was meant for you , I 'd take some pleasure in my life again , Dance , have a feast of oysters and champagne , Buy a new winter frock and hat , instead Of wishing , as I do , that I were dead . For you deserve it — you that make a joke Out of my misery . JULIET . Helen — when I spoke Of being Calypso , did n't I , to my shame , Own the wild sins that cluster round her name ? Alas , I meant it . HELEN . Nobody could be So blind as not to know it 's me — I — me : And since you 're now my enemy , I shall go At once . But after this , I 'd have you know , Our friendship 's dead — for always ! Please forget You ever knew me . JULIET . Helen , do n't go yet .... HELEN . I must . And let me say that if you call To-morrow you 'll have wasted time , that 's all . I sha n't go home to-night . JULIET . Where will you sleep ? HELEN . Battersea Bridge is high , and the Thames deep . JULIET . You wicked child ! You must n't talk like that . HELEN . A plunge and then —— JULIET . With such a pretty hat ? HELEN ( returning ) . You never said you liked it . JULIET . No . I 've been So worried all day by this Galahad Green . For really , Helen , once and for all be certain It 's not from your life that he 's wrenched the curtain . You can still face the world . You 've not the least Cause to abominate the loathsome beast — Except as I 'm your friend : and since I know , Now , that your strange mistake has hurt you so , Believe me , I rejoice — yes , even rejoice — That I , not you , suffer by Galahad 's choice . I bear it willingly . Must I prove my case ? Give me one moment , while I find the place .... ( She opens the book and searches through it feverishly . ) HELEN ( opening copy ) . Oh , if it comes to evidence ...! But indeed I simply can n't go through it ! JULIET . Let me read Page twenty-four : ‘ Between him and his wife A deep gulf lay . She wanted to see life Through her own eyes , but he preferred , she knew , The monocle of The Saturday Review ’ — There ! Do n't you see ? That paper 's just the one I always said would patronize the sun . HELEN . That ? Why , look here — page forty-two — ‘ Her eyes Were green , her honey-coloured —— ’ JULIET . Mere disguise ! He had to change a little here and there . Listen : ‘ She glowered —— ’ HELEN . ‘ Her honey-coloured hair Lay in profusion on her shoulders —— ’ JULIET . ‘ Then She thought “ It 's time —— ” HELEN . ‘ To win the love of men — “ What 's that ? ” she cried . “ I ever hated sin —— ” JULIET . “ But now I 'll change . To-morrow I 'll begin .... My sins are many . Can they be washed away ? " ’ HELEN . ‘ So she used Morny bath-salts every day . Often she 'd sponge herself for hours , and dream Of love , veiled only by the bashful steam . Sometimes , perhaps , an over-amorous drop Would trickle down —— ’ JULIET ( shocked ) . Helen , my dear — do stop ! Really ! HELEN . But that 's conclusive ! JULIET . I admit That she had beauty , savoir-faire , and wit , But she was wicked , too , reckless and haughty —— HELEN . I can n't pretend that I was never naughty . JULIET . Naughty , perhaps ; but you could never trip so Continually as Mr. Green 's Calypso . HELEN . I do believe you think I would n't dare Calypso 's deeds . I 've done them all — so there ! JULIET . Well , you shall have the truth . I 'll make a clean Breast of it . Who , you ask , is Galahad Green ? I know him ! HELEN . Juliet ! And he dares affirm That I was not .... The lily-livered worm ! JULIET . But if he writes a letter to the Press Declaring that he never saw you —— HELEN . Yes , And makes me look a fool . What can I do When every one I meet says ‘ Is it you .... That wicked gorgeous creature , that wild thing Ecstatic and unmoral as the Spring ...? ’ Of course I owned it . JULIET . Helen — I can still Save you . I 'll make him write —— HELEN . No , no ! JULIET . I will — And now , at once . The telephone ! HELEN ( stopping JULIET ) . But I say You 're not to ! JULIET ( struggling ) . Let me go ! We can n't delay . HELEN . Juliet , for goodness ’ sake do n't be so dense ! JULIET . What do you mean ? HELEN . Where 's your intelligence , Your tact , your feminine intuition ? Where Your sympathy ? Must I lay my soul quite bare ? JULIET ( returning and collapsing into her chair ) . So far as I 'm concerned you 're talking Greek . HELEN . They 've sold nine thousand copies in one week . JULIET . Why , one would think , in spite of all that 's passed , You liked the book . HELEN . So you 've got there at last ! You are an also-ran . JULIET . Good heavens ! HELEN . I had To say that I was furious , and not glad ; But what girl would n't feel some little stir Of pride when all the town 's in love with her ? You do n't know half that 's happened . This new novel Has simply made all other writers grovel . Bennett 's gone mad with envy . J. C. Snaith Is in decline . Galsworthy 's a mere wraith . Chesterton , having burnt his cap and bells , Drowned himself in a butt of Malmesey . Wells Vowed to the Press he 'd never write again . May Sinclair , Violet Hunt , and Clemence Dane Have gone — forevermore to breathe the air Of Iceland . Poor Hugh Walpole 's in despair . Now do you see my point ? Did n't you lie When you said that Calypso was n't I ? JULIET . Yes . HELEN . And the author learnt it all from you . I think you owe me something . JULIET . Very true .... What do you want ? HELEN . Oh , Juliet — since I 've been His model , do you think that Mr. Green Would possibly — just some day — take me out To supper ? JULIET . When ? To-night ? HELEN . Could he ? JULIET . No doubt . HELEN . Let 's ring him up . JULIET ( stopping her ) . Who said that I was dense ? HELEN . But if he 's free ——? JULIET . Use your intelligence , Your feminine intuition . HELEN . Yes , but how ? JULIET . Galahad does invite you here and now . All is not masculine that 's Green . HELEN ( collapsing ) . Your book ! JULIET . Here are my notices , if you care to look . HELEN . My dear !... And all those famous novelists , too — Just shrivelling up with jealousy of you ! JULIET . Ah , but the poets ! They are delighted — they Whose rustic hearts envy could never sway . Read what they 've said . HELEN . I 'm sure it 's very sweet . But somehow I can never keep my seat On Pegasus . JULIET . Pegasus ! No one rides him now : But ah , how steadily up Parnassus ’ brow , With farmyard straw , not vine-leaves , in his hair , Squire Turner Pounds on Shanks 's de la Mare !</docImprint>

    <head>THE VOLCANIC ISLAND</head>
    <stage>SCENE . The sitting-room of a flat in Knightsbridge . Back : centre , a fireplace with fire burning ; right , a cupboard containing tea things ; left , a tall lacquered screen . Front : a table on which are illustrated papers and a parcel of books tied with string ; a chair to each side of the table .</stage>
    <stage>The outside door is heard closing .</stage>
    <stage>DOROTHEA ( without ) . Kate !</stage>
   </stage>
   <stage>She enters , right , in a fashionable Spring walking costume . ) So I 've caught her ! Gone at half-past three — Gone to ‘ the pictures ’ with her young man Bill . I hope she 'll not be foolish .... Now for tea .</stage>
   <stage>She puts a kettle on the fire and brings a plate of cakes to the table . ) Ah ! So the Mudie books have come — but still Nothing from James . He really is too shy — And Mother always whispers when we meet , ‘ Well , dear , no startling news ? ’ I wish he 'd try ! What have they sent me from New Oxford Street ? ‘ Poems , ’ by Marshlight .... Quite a charming face .... Four portraits !... And how good it is to find A note that tells the very hour and place When each mouse-lyric shook that mountain mind !... And here ? Oh Mudie ! Sending this to me ! ‘ A Bed of Roses . George .... ’ I 'll try again .... ‘ Peeled Onions ’ ! Now , whatever might they be ? Of course ! New tales by Ethel Colburn Mayne . How hypodermic ! What she does without ! What whittling of mere obvious fact ! Indeed I sometimes tremble when her books come out For fear there wo n't be any words to read .... The last two ? These — hobnobbing all this time , Not rent to rags , not mutually destroyed ? For here 's that famous work , ‘ Soul from the Slime , ’ By Jung , and here ‘ Slime from the Soul , ’ by Freud . They may be risqué but how up to date — And James need never know I 've read them .... Stop ! Surely ? It is ! A telegram ! Oh , Kate , You little fool , to dump the books on top ! Reply paid , too .... ( Reading ) ‘ Wylde , 15 Claridge Hill . Would you accept me for your husband ? James .... ’ At last !... What answer ? If I say I will , The Morning Post will paragraph our names With me as ‘ Dorothea , second child ’ — Et cetera — and The Tatler , I expect , Will have a picture , ‘ Cupid 's Bag . Miss Wylde , Sir James Adolphus Porter 's bride-elect , A well-known figure both where Fashion reigns And where our young intelligenzia meet .... ’ But shall I ? If he read more , had more brains , More fire , and just a little less conceit ! A VOICE ( behind the screen ) . Marry him at your peril ! DOROTHEA ( not hearing ) . He 's a man Of wealth and rank — an O. B. E .— and yet To marry without love .... Some people can .</stage>

     <l>DOROTHEA</l>
     <stage>half hypnotized</stage>
     <l>Of which no more is visible to men</l>

     <l>Dorothy Wild . You end yours with an ‘ e ’</l>
     <l>And spell it with a ‘ y ’ — as though for shame</l>
     <l>Of owning sisterhood with trees and birds</l>
     <l>And dragonflies ; as though you 'd never run</l>
     <l>Beside the foam , shouting ecstatic words</l>
     <l>In the wind 's ear , nor let the immortal sun</l>
     <l>Have your whole body till Something , not of time ,</l>
     <l>Like an elixir flowed through every vein .</l>
     <l>You ? You lack pith . You 'd never love through crime ;</l>
     <l>But when I love , I dare — and brook no chain !</l>

     <l>Really ! And why not you a part of me ?</l>
     <l>How much of Time have you known ? Twenty years ;</l>
     <l>But I , whom not ten thousand can make old ,</l>
     <l>Have worshipped trees , loved naiads , boxed the ears</l>
     <l>Of mountain satyrs , touched the Fleece of Gold ,</l>
     <l>And ridden great centaurs . When I catch the strain</l>
     <l>Of Homer 's verse I hear his very lyre</l>
     <l>Trembling : for me Hector is newly slain ,</l>
     <l>And it was yesterday Troy fell in fire .</l>
     <l>They who at last have found me little guess</l>
     <l>Whither I lead . They fancy that one blow</l>
     <l>Has brought down Heaven in fragments . Nonetheless ,</l>
     <l>I shall build what they think I overthrow !</l>
     <l>And you ? You 're just a weir that tames my power .</l>
     <l>I am the rushing car and you the brake</l>
     <l>That checks me : I the root and you the flower ;</l>
     <l>I the true girl ——</l>

   <sp>
    <speaker>DOROTHEA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Now , Dorothy , be reasonable . Sit down</l>
     <l>Like a well-mannered girl , or — if you must —</l>
     <l>Crouch like a tigress there and fret and frown ,</l>
     <l>But do n't break in . I think it 's only just</l>
     <l>That I — for , after all , I really am</l>
     <l>The civilized and reputable Miss Wylde —</l>
     <l>Should have the answering of this telegram .</l>
     <l>Say what you will , you 're nothing but a child</l>
     <l>Who lies among the daffodils of Spring ,</l>
     <l>Lost in a book of marvels . At a glance</l>
     <l>I know you — how you 're dreaming of some king</l>
     <l>From over the blue mountains of romance</l>
     <l>Who 'll set you on a charger black as night ,</l>
     <l>And , spurring on by dragon-haunted caves ,</l>
     <l>Come to his castle just when the sunset-light</l>
     <l>In Fairyland floats on the girdling waves .</l>
     <l>But kings are n't like that now . They puff cigars ,</l>
     <l>Wear bowlers and check-suits , and fill the gaps</l>
     <l>Left between opening Parliament and bazaars</l>
     <l>By betting on the racecourse . Or perhaps</l>
     <l>You want some hero from a Conrad tale</l>
     <l>Who 'd stand , white-ducked , against the torrid blue</l>
     <l>And shoot down tribes with bullets fast as hail :</l>
     <l>But think , my dear — he simply would n't do .</l>
     <l>Picture it . We should take him out to dine —</l>
     <l>The ladies would withdraw — he 'd start to speak</l>
     <l>About old Lingard , while they passed the wine ,</l>
     <l>And go on with the story for a week .</l>
     <l>No ! We must have it clear . I much regret</l>
     <l>This violent tug-of-war between our aims</l>
     <l>But — I 'm determined .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>

   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Why not ? Answer my questions . One :</l>
     <l>Does he beat time to music with his hand ?</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>DOROTHEA</speaker>
    <p>Well ——</p>
   </sp>

    <p>Oh , sometimes ——</p>

     <l>Three : and does he understand</l>
     <l>That wicked frocks do n't mean a wicked life ?</l>
     <l>Four ——</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>

   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Four :</l>
     <l>Would n't he read the golf news to his wife ?</l>
     <l>Five : Can he tell — the next day — what you wore ?</l>
     <l>Six : If he knows an author , will he wait</l>
     <l>To get a copy free or buy the book ?</l>
     <l>Seven : Is he fond of curate stories ? Eight :</l>
     <l>If , when you 're dressed , you wonder how you look</l>
     <l>And ask him , as you 're driving to the dance ,</l>
     <l>Does n't he , after everything you 've done ,</l>
     <l>Say ‘ Oh , all right ’ — without a single glance ?</l>
     <l>Nine : If you flirt a little , for the fun</l>
     <l>Of being a woman , would he think you light ?</l>
     <l>Ten : Does he say , when dining in Soho ,</l>
     <l>‘ I do n't think we shall need champagne to-night —</l>
     <l>But if you really want it , let me know ? ’</l>
     <l>Eleven ——</l>

    <speaker>DOROTHEA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Oh please ! I do n't — in fact , I can n't —</l>
     <l>Dispute the list . I 'll openly admit</l>
     <l>That James is not the man I used to want ....</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Splendid ! Now , where 's his wire ? We 'll answer it</l>
     <l>With one majestic ‘ No . ’</l>
     <l>DOROTHEA</l>
     <stage>stopping her</stage>
     <l>Not yet . Be kind !</l>
     <l>Think what I lose in losing James , and then</l>
     <l>You 'll change your mind — your portion of our mind .</l>
     <l>I want a man to kiss ——</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
    <p>But why not ten ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>DOROTHEA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>My dear ! I want the life of modern man .</l>
     <l>I want to quote the works of Douglas Cole ,</l>
     <l>Think all men base except the artisan ,</l>
     <l>And smile at God , religion , and the soul .</l>
     <l>I want to find new genius everywhere .</l>
     <l>I want to sit in drawing-rooms and say</l>
     <l>‘ Rossetti , Watts ? Of course , they can n't compare</l>
     <l>With Roger , or the smallest Fry , to-day . ’</l>
     <l>So , wo n't you be an angel ? Share the flat</l>
     <l>In honourable retirement ! Do n't you see</l>
     <l>You should ?</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>DOROTHY</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Subconscious ! Well , I may be that —</l>
     <l>But no great eras come apart from me .</l>
     <l>What though to-day I have less power than you ?</l>
     <l>The wheel will turn ; and shall I not be there</l>
     <l>To run with roses down Fifth Avenue</l>
     <l>And make a Roman revel in Mayfair ?</l>
     <l>No ! I maintain my right to have a say</l>
     <l>In this , our marriage ; therefore comprehend</l>
     <l>Once and for all that I shall not give way !</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>

    <speaker>DOROTHEA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>I 've done my best to treat you as a friend .</l>

But wait : Suppose that is n't really Merlin 's Gate , Nor this the garden where a girl who loathes Our Twentieth Century<stage>all except its clothes</stage>May turn the Book of Time to any page And move within some more romantic age ? The map will show . Yes , there 's the gate , and there 's That wall , that table , these two empty chairs .... Everything 's right . How wonderful , how splendid , To know that here the roar of time has ended ! Now , let me see ...<stage>Consulting her map .</stage>If I should take that road What century should I have for my abode ? ‘ To Ancient Rome . ’ Lovely !<stage>She starts to go out , right . Then stops .</stage>It might be serious , Though , if I chanced on Nero or Tiberius . The Romans were rough diamonds .... This way here — So the map says — would lead me to the year Ten-sixty-six . I wo n't be such a fool As go back where I stuck so long at school . William the First was always dull . I know He 'd make me listen to him — standing so , With Bayeux hands , knee crookèd , and neck bowed — While he read all the Domesday Book aloud . I sha n't go there .... Now , that 's a pretty view !<stage>Referring to the map .</stage>‘ The Eighteenth Century : Boswell Avenue . ’ I might try that . But no — that wo n't do either . I 'd have to wear a wig or tell them why there , Love coffee-houses more than trees and birds , And talk in such tremendously long words . I know , I know ! If I can find the way I 'll wander back into the sumptuous day When , in his gardens near the warm lagoon , Titian gave feasts under the stars and moon . That would be heavenly ! Those were noble times . There was a grandeur even about the crimes Of people like the Borgias ... and their dresses , And the sweet way they wore their hair in tresses , And — oh , and everything ! What was Titian 's date ? I must n't err into a time too late ; But how to make quite sure ? Suppose I took My bearings by this little precious book — Addington Symonds ?... Oh , that I knew more ! Was it in fifteen-sixty or before ?<stage>Settling herself in one of the chairs she becomes absorbed in her book . Enter , right , GIOCONDA carrying two or three modern novels .</stage>GIOCONDA<stage>speaking off right</stage>I thank you , gondolier . You drowned my nurse With true dramatic finish . Take this purse . So — I am in that Garden where time speeds Backward or forward as our fancy needs . How sick I am of cloaks and ambuscades , Of poison , daggers , moonlight serenades , Of those dull dances that are all I trace — Pavane , lavolte , forlana , cinquepace — And the long pageant of our life at Venice ! Now , in the Twentieth Century there is tennis , With cream and strawberries round a chestnut-tree , And day-long idling in the June-blue sea , And soda-fountains , too , and motor-cars , And Henley Weeks and Russian Ballet ‘ stars . ’ Oh , what a wealth of joy that century has ! To think that I myself may learn to jazz ! Truly , I judge it has no slightest flaw — The glorious age of Bennett , Wells , and Shaw .<stage>She sets her books on the table and curtsies to them .</stage>Gramercy , gentlemen ,— inasmuch as you , Here in your works , have taught me what to do , How to play hockey , smoke , and bob my hair In nineteen-twenty , when at last I 'm there . Which path would bring me there , I wonder ? How Choose of so many ? If I 'm near it now I ought to hear the roaring of their trains , Their motor-horns , their humming monoplanes ....<stage>She listens intently for a moment .</stage>The very bees are silent ....<stage>Seeing HILDA .</stage>Who is that ? Surely , unless the books have lied , her hat Came from renowned ‘ Roulette 's , ’ in Portman Square ! A Twentieth-Century girl ! She will know where The Spaniards gather and the Black Friars dwell .<stage>Kissing her hand , right .</stage>Farewell , Rialto ! Bridge of Sighs , farewell !</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>She goes up to HILDA and curtsies ceremoniously .</stage>
   <stage>Dear Signorina .... Signorina .... Deep In Bennett 's fragrant works ,—— or can she sleep ? Could The Five Towns have bored her ? Let me try Once more . Most noble Signorina —— HILDA ( starting up ) . Why , Who are you , lady ? By your dress and ways I think you must have come from Titian 's days .</stage>

     <l>Did he , I 'd read his letters ten times over —</l>
     <l>But you do n't know the Twentieth-Century lover .</l>
     <l>Oh , for a man who 'd write through tears , all swimmily ,</l>
     <l>And woo me with grand metaphor and simile !</l>
     <l>I could n't bear the slang that Harry used</l>
     <l>In asking for my hand .</l>

   <sp>
    <speaker>GIOCONDA</speaker>
    <p>So you refused !</p>

     <l>How odd ! I had a letter , all in rhyme ,</l>
     <l>Brought by a lackey to my father 's gate</l>
     <l>Just when dawn broke . As if I could n't wait !</l>
     <l>He dashed up , panting ; and his horse 's mouth</l>
     <l>Was flecked with blood and foam ....</l>

    <speaker>GIOCONDA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>The fellow gave the letter , gasped , went red ,</l>
     <l>And straightway horse and lackey fell down dead .</l>
     <l>I scanned the note , observed the flowery phrases</l>
     <l>In which the writer smothered me with praises ;</l>
     <l>Compared them with the style of Bernard Shaw ,</l>
     <l>And told him straightway that he might withdraw .</l>
