   <div type="introduction">
    <head>Introduction</head>
    <p n="1">THIS play — originally intended to form part of Angels and Ministers — was separated on an after-thought as a concession to those who do not like to have their politics and their religion mixed . And , as the Victorian age was eminently successful in keeping the two apart , it is ‘ in keeping , ’ in another sense , with the Victorianism of the religion here portrayed that it should make its appearance under a separate cover .</p>
    <p n="2">As some of my critics seem anxious to trace the inspiration of these Victorian plays to an outside source , and are divided , as regards the historical section , between the Abraham Lincoln of Mr. John Drinkwater and the Queen Victoria of Mr. Lytton Strachey , may I assure them that my historical method of treating Kings and Queens ‘ intimately ’ was derived from my own play Pains and Penalties , published in 1911 , and that my anthropomorphic theology is based upon the first book I ever wrote , Gods and their Makers , published in 1897 . I do not think that Possession owes anything either to Cranford or the writings of Mrs. Humphry Ward .</p>

    <p>SCENE .— The Everlasting Habitations It is evening ( or so it seems ) , and to the comfortably furnished Victorian drawing-room a middle-aged maid-servant in cap and apron brings a lamp , and proceeds to draw blinds and close curtains . To do this she passes the fire-place , where before a pleasantly bright hearth sits , comfortably sedate , an elderly lady whose countenance and attitude suggest the very acme of genteel repose . She is a handsome woman , very conscious of herself , but carrying the burden of her importance with an ease which , in her own mind , leaves nothing to be desired . The once-striking outline of her features has been rounded by good feeding to a softness which is merely physical ; and her voice , when she speaks , has a calculated gentleness very caressing to her own ear , and a little irritating to others who are not of an inferior class . Menials like it , however . The room , though over-upholstered , and not furnished with any more individual taste than that which gave its generic stamp to the great Victorian period , is the happy possessor of some good things . Upon the mantel-shelf , backed by a large mirror , stands old china in alternation with alabaster jars , under domed shades , and tall vases encompassed by pendant ringlets of glass-lustre . Rose-wood , walnut , and mahogany make a well-wooded interior ; and in the dates thus indicated there is a touch of Georgian . But , over and above these mellowing features of a respectable ancestry , the annunciating Angel of the Great Exhibition of 1851 has spread a brooding wing . And while the older articles are treasured on account of family association , the younger and newer stand erected in places of honour by reason of an intrinsic beauty never previously attained to . Through this chamber the dashing crinoline has wheeled the too vast orb of its fate , and left fifty years after ( if we may measure the times of Heaven by the ticks of an earthly chronometer ) a mark which nothing is likely to erase . Upon the small table , where Hannah the servant deposits the lamp , lies a piece of crochet-work . The fair hands that have been employed on it are folded on a lap of corded silk representing the fashions of the nineties , and the grey-haired beauty ( that once was ) sits contemplative , wearing a cap of creamish lace , tastefully arranged , not unaware that in the entering lamp-light , and under the fire 's soft glow of approval , she presents to her domestic 's eye an improving picture of gentility . It is to Miss Julia Robinson 's credit — and she herself places it there emphatically — that she always treats servants humanly , though at a distance . And when she now speaks she confers her slight remark just a little as though it were a favour .</p>

    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>How the days are drawing out , Hannah .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>HANNAH</speaker>
    <p>Yes , Ma'am ; nicely , are n't they ?</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>For Hannah , being old-established , may say a thing or two not in the strict order . In fact , it may be said that , up to a well-understood point , character is encouraged in her , and is allowed to peep through in her remarks .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>What time is it ? HANNAH<stage>looking with better eyes than her mistress at the large ormolu clock which records eternally the time of the great Exhibition</stage>Almost a quarter to six , Ma'am .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>So late ? She ought to have been here long ago .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>HANNAH</speaker>
    <p>Who , Ma'am , did you say , Ma'am ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>My sister , Mrs. James . You remember ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>HANNAH</speaker>
    <p>What , Miss Martha , Ma'am ? Well !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>No , it 's Miss Laura this time : you did n't know she had married , I suppose ? HANNAH<stage>with a world of meaning , well under control</stage>No , Ma'am .<stage>A pause .</stage>I made up the bed in the red room ; was that right , Ma'am ? JULIA<stage>archly surprised</stage>What ? Then you knew someone was coming ? Why did you pretend , Hannah ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>HANNAH</speaker>
    <p>Well , Ma'am , you see , you had n't told me before .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>I could n't . One cannot always be sure .<stage>This mysteriously .</stage>But something tells me now that she is to be with us . I have been expecting her over four days . HANNAH<stage>picking her phrases a little , as though on doubtful ground</stage>It must be a long way , Ma'am . Did she make a comfortable start , Ma'am ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Very quietly , I 'm told . No pain .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>HANNAH</speaker>
    <p>I wonder what she 'll be able to eat now , Ma'am . She was always very particular .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>I daresay you will be told soon enough .<stage>Thus in veiled words she conveys that Hannah knows something of Mrs. James 's character .</stage>HANNAH<stage>resignedly</stage>Yes , M 'm .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>I do n't think I 'll wait any longer . If you 'll bring in tea now . Make enough for two , in case : pour it off into another pot , and have it under the tea-cosy .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>HANNAH</speaker>
    <p>Yes , Ma'am .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>Left alone , the dear lady enjoys the sense of herself and the small world of her own thoughts in solitude . Then she sighs indulgently .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Yes , I suppose I would rather it had been Martha . Poor Laura !<stage>She puts out her hand for her crochet , when it is arrested by the sound of a knock , rather rapacious in character .</stage>Ah , that 's Laura all over !<stage>Seated quite composedly and fondling her well-kept hands , she awaits the moment of arrival . Very soon the door opens , and the over-expected Mrs. James — a luxuriant garden of widow 's weeds , enters . She is a lady more strongly and sharply featured than her sister , but there is nothing thin-lipped about her ; with resolute eye and mouth a little grim , yet pleased at so finding herself , she steps into this chamber of old memories and cherished possessions , which translation to another and a better world has made hers again . For a moment she sees the desire of her eyes and is satisfied ; but for a moment only . The apparition of another already in possession takes her aback .</stage>JULIA<stage>with soft effusiveness</stage>Well , Laura ! LAURA<stage>startled</stage>Julia !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Here you are !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Whoever thought of finding you ? JULIA<stage>sweetly</stage>Did n't you ?</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>They have managed to embrace : but Laura continues to have her grievance .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>No ! not for a moment . I really think they might have told me . What brought you ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Our old home , Laura . It was a natural choice , I think : as one was allowed to choose . I suppose you were ? LAURA<stage>her character showing</stage>I did n't ask anyone 's leave to come .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>And how are you ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>I do n't know ; I want my tea .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Hannah is just bringing it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Who 's Hannah ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Our Hannah : our old servant . Did n't she open the door to you ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>What ? Come back , has she ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>I found her here when I came , seven years ago . I did n't ask questions . Here she is .<stage>ENTER Hannah with the tea-tray .</stage>LAURA<stage>with a sort of grim jocosity</stage>How d'ye do , Hannah ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>HANNAH</speaker>
    <p>Nicely , thank you , Ma'am . How are you , Ma'am ?</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>Hannah , as she puts down the tray , is prepared to have her hand shaken : for it is a long time ( thirty years or so in earthly measure ) since they met . But Mrs. James is not so cordial as all that .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>I 'm very tired .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>You 've come a long way .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>But Laura 's sharp attention has gone elsewhere .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Hannah , what have you got my best tray for ? You know that is not to be used every day .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>It 's all right , Laura . You do n't understand .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>What do n't I understand ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Here one always uses the best . Nothing wears out or gets broken .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Then where 's the pleasure of it ? If one always uses them and they never break — ‘ best ’ means nothing !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>It is a little puzzling at first . You must be patient .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>I 'm not a child , Julia . JULIA<stage>beautifully ignoring</stage>A little more coal , please , Hannah .<stage>Then to her sister as she pours out the tea .</stage>And how did you leave everybody ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Oh , pretty much as usual . Most of them having colds . That 's how I got mine . Mrs. Hilliard came to call and left it behind her . I went out with it in an east wind and that finished me .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Oh , but how provoking !<stage>She wishes to be sympathetic ; but this is a line of conversation she instinctively avoids .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>No , Julia ! . . .<stage>This , delivered with force , arrests the criminal intention .</stage>No sugar . To think of your forgetting that ! JULIA<stage>most sweetly</stage>Milk ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Yes , you know I take milk .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>Crossing over , but sitting away from the tea-table , she lets her sister wait on her .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Did Martha send me any message ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>How could she ? She did n't know I was coming .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Was it so sudden ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>I sent for her and she did n't come . Think of that !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Oh ! She would be sorry . Tea-cake ? LAURA<stage>taking the tea-cake that is offered her</stage>I 'm not so sure . She was nursing Edwin 's boy through the measles , so of course I did n't count .<stage>Nosing suspiciously .</stage>Is this China tea ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>If you like to think it . You have as you choose . How is our brother , Edwin ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>His wife 's more trying than ever . Julia , what a fool that woman is !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Well , let 's hope he does n't know it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>He must know . I 've told him . She sent a wreath to my funeral ,</l>
     <l>‘ With love and fond affection , from Emily . ’ Fond fiddlesticks ! Humbug !</l>
     <l>She knows I can n't abide her .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>I suppose she thought it was the correct thing .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>And I doubt if it cost more than ten shillings . Now Mrs. Dobson — you remember her : she lives in Tudor Street with a daughter one never sees — something wrong in her head , and has fits — she sent me a cross of lilies , white lilac , and stephanotis , as handsome as you could wish ; and a card — I forget what was on the card . . . . Julia , when you died ——</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Oh , do n't Laura !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Well , you did die , did n't you ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Here one does n't talk of it . That 's over . There are things you will have to learn .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>What I was going to say was — when I died I found my sight was much better . I could read all the cards without my glasses . Do you use glasses ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Sometimes , for association . I have these of our dear Mother 's in her tortoise-shell case .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>That reminds me . Where is our Mother ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>She comes — sometimes .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Why is n't she here always ? JULIA<stage>with pained sweetness</stage>I do n't know , Laura . I never ask questions .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Really , Julia , I shall be afraid to open my mouth presently ! JULIA<stage>long-suffering still</stage>When you see her you will understand . I told her you were coming , so I daresay she will look in .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>‘ Look in ’ !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Perhaps . That is her chair , you remember . She always sits there , still .<stage>ENTER Hannah with the coal .</stage>Just a little on , please , Hannah — only a little .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>This is n't China tea : it 's Indian , three and sixpenny .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Mine is ten shilling China .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Lor ’ , Julia ! How are you able to afford it ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>A little imagination goes a long way here , you 'll find . Once I tasted it . So now I can always taste it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Well ! I wish I 'd known .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Now you do .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>But I never tasted tea at more than three-and-six . Had I known , I could have got two ounces of the very best , and had it when ——</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>A lost opportunity . Life is full of them .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Then you mean to tell me that if I had indulged more then , I could indulge more now ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Undoubtedly . As I never knew what it was to wear sables , I have to be content with ermine .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Lor ’ , Julia , how paltry !</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>While this conversation has been going on , a gentle old lady has appeared upon the scene , unnoticed and unannounced . One perceives , that is to say , that the high-backed arm-chair beside the fire , sheltered by a screen from all possibility of draughts , has an occupant . Dress and appearance show a doubly septuagenarian character : at the age of seventy , which in this place she retains as the hall-mark of her earthly pilgrimage , she belongs also to the ‘ seventies ’ of the last century , wears watered silk , and retains under her cap a shortened and stiffer version of the side-curls with which she and all ‘ the sex ’ captivated the hearts of Charles Dickens and other novelists in their early youth . She has soft and indeterminate features , and when she speaks her voice , a little shaken by the quaver of age , is soft and indeterminate also . Gentle and lovable , you will be surprised to discover that she , also , has a will of her own ; but for the present this does not show . From the dimly illumined corner behind the lamp her voice comes soothingly to break the discussion .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>OLD LADY</speaker>
    <p>My dear , would you move the light a little nearer ? I 've dropped a stitch . LAURA<stage>starting up</stage>Why , Mother dear , when did you come in ? JULIA<stage>interposing with arresting hand</stage>Do n't ! You must n't try to touch her , or she goes .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Goes ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>I can n't explain . She is not quite herself . She does n't always hear what one says . LAURA<stage>assertively</stage>She can hear me .<stage>To prove it , she raises her voice defiantly .</stage>Ca n't you , Mother ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. R</speaker>
    <p><stage>the voice perhaps reminding her</stage>Jane , dear , I wonder what 's become of Laura , little Laura : she was always so naughty and difficult to manage , so different from Martha — and the rest .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Lor ’ , Julia ! Is it as bad as that ? Mother , ‘ little Laura ’ is here , sitting in front of you . Do n't you know me ?</p>
   </sp>

    <speaker>MRS. R</speaker>
    <p>Do you remember , Jane , one day when we 'd all started for a walk , Laura had forgotten to bring her gloves , and I sent her back for them ? And on the way she met little Dorothy Jones , and she took her gloves off her , and came back with them just as if they were her own .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>What a good memory you have , Mother ! I remember it too . She was an odious little thing , that Dorothy — always so whiney-piney .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>More tea , Laura ?</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>Laura pushes her cup at her without remark , for she has been kept waiting ; then , in loud tones , to suit the one whom she presumes to be rather deaf :</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Mother ! Where are you living now ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. R</speaker>
    <p>I 'm living , my dear .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>I said ‘ where ? ’</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>We live where it suits us , Laura .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Julia , I was n't addressing myself to you . Mother , where are you living ? . . . Why , where has she gone to ?<stage>For now we perceive that this gentle Old Lady so devious in her conversation has a power of self-possession , of which , very retiringly , she avails herself .</stage>JULIA<stage>improving the occasion , as she hands back the cup , with that touch of superiority so exasperating to a near relative</stage>Now you see ! If you press her too much , she goes . . . . You 'll have to accommodate yourself , Laura . LAURA<stage>imposing her own explanation</stage>I think you gave me green tea , Julia . . . or have had it yourself . JULIA<stage>knowing better</stage>The dear Mother seldom stays long , except when she finds me alone .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>Having insinuated this barb into the flesh of her ‘ dear sister , ’ she takes up her crochet with an air of great contentment . Mrs. James , meanwhile , to make herself more at home , now that tea is finished , undoes her bonnet-strings with a tug , and lets them hang . She is not in the best of tempers .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>I do n't believe she recognised me . Why did she keep on calling me</l>
     <l>‘ Jane ’ ?</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>She took you for poor Aunt Jane , I fancy . LAURA<stage>infuriated at being taken for anyone ‘ poor ’</stage>Why should she do that , pray ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Well , there always was a likeness , you know ; and you are older than you were , Laura . LAURA<stage>crushingly</stage>Does ‘ poor Aunt Jane ’ wear widow 's weeds ?<stage>This reminds her not only of her own condition , but of other things as well . She sits up and takes a stiller bigger bite into her new world .</stage>Julia ! . . . Where 's William ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>I have n't inquired . LAURA<stage>self-importance and a sense of duty consuming her</stage>I wish to see him .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Better not , as it did n't occur to you before .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Am I not to see my own husband , pray ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>He did n't ever live here , you know .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>He can come , I suppose . He has got legs like the rest of us .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Yes , but one can n't force people : at least , not here . You should remember that — before he married you — he had other ties .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>Mrs. James preserves her self-possession , but there is battle in her eye .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>He was married to me longer than he was to Isabel .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>They had children .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>I could have had children if I chose . I did n't choose . . . . Julia , how am I to see him ? JULIA<stage>washing her hands of it</stage>You must manage for yourself , Laura .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>I 'm puzzled ! Here are we in the next world just as we expected , and where are all the —? I mean , ought n't we to be seeing a great many more things than we do ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>What sort of things ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Well , . . . have you seen Moses and the Prophets ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>I have n't looked for them , Laura . On Sundays , I still go to hear</l>
     <l>Mr. Moore .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>That 's you all over ! You never would go to the celebrated preachers . But I mean to .<stage>Pious curiosity awakens .</stage>What happens here , on Sundays ? JULIA<stage>smiling</stage>Oh , just the same .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>No High Church ways , I hope ? If they go in for that here , I shall go out ! JULIA<stage>patiently explanatory</stage>You will go out if you wish to go out . You can choose your church . As I tell you , I always go to hear Mr. Moore ; you can go and hear Canon Farrar .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Dean Farrar , I suppose you mean .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>He was not Dean in my day .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>He ought to have been a Bishop — Archbishop , I think — so learned , and such a magnificent preacher . But I still wonder why we do n't see Moses and the Prophets .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Well , Laura , it 's the world as we knew it — that for the present . No doubt other things will come in time , gradually . But I do n't know : I do n't ask questions . LAURA<stage>doubtfully</stage>I suppose it is Heaven , in a way , though ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Dispensation has its own ways , Laura ; and we have ours . LAURA<stage>who is not going to be theologically dictated to by anyone lower than Dean Farrar</stage>Julia , I shall start washing the old china again .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>As you like ; nothing ever gets soiled here .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>It 's all very puzzling . The world seems cut in half . Things do n't seem real .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>More real , I should say . We have them — as we wish them to be .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Then why can n't we have our Mother , like other things ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Ah , with persons it is different . We all belong to ourselves now . That one has to accept . LAURA<stage>stubbornly</stage>Does William belong to himself ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>I suppose .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>It is n't Scriptural !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>It 's better .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Julia , do n't be blasphemous !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>To consult William 's wishes , I meant .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>But I want him . I 've a right to him . If he did n't mean to belong to me , he ought not to have married me .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>People make mistakes sometimes .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Then they should stick to them . It 's not honourable . Julia , I mean to have William ! JULIA<stage>resignedly</stage>You and he must arrange that between you . LAURA<stage>making a dash for it</stage>William ! William , I say ! William !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Oh , Laura , you 'll wake the dead !<stage>She gasps , but it is too late : the hated word is out .</stage>LAURA<stage>as one who will be obeyed</stage>William !</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>The door does not open ; but there appears through it the indistinct figure of an elderly gentleman with a weak chin and a shifting eye . He stands irresolute and apprehensive ; clearly his presence there is perfunctory . Wearing his hat and carrying a hand-bag , he seems merely to have looked in while passing .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Apparently you are to have your wish .<stage>She waves an introductory hand ; Mrs. James turns , and regards the unsatisfactory apparition with suspicion .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>William , is that you ? WILLIAM<stage>nervously</stage>Yes , my dear ; it 's me .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Ca n't you be more distinct than that ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
    <p>Why do you want me ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Have you forgotten I 'm your wife ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
    <p>I thought you were my widow , my dear .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>William , do n't prevaricate . I am your wife , and you know it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
    <p>Does a wife wear widow 's weeds ? A widow is such a distant relation : no wonder I look indistinct .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>How did I know whether I was going to find you here ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
    <p>Where else ? But you look very nice as you are , my dear . Black suits you .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>But Mrs. James is not to be turned off by compliments .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>William , who are you living with ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
    <p>With myself , my dear .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Anyone else ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
    <p>Off and on I have friends staying .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Are you living with Isabel ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
    <p>She comes in occasionally to see how I 'm getting on .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>And how are you ‘ getting on ’ — without me ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
    <p>Oh , I manage — somehow .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Are you living a proper life , William ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
    <p>Well , I 'm here , my dear ; what more do you want to know ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>There 's a great deal I want to know . But I wish you 'd come in and shut the door , instead of standing out there in the passage .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>The door is shut , Laura .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Then I do n't call it a door . WILLIAM<stage>trying to make things pleasant</stage>When is a door not a door ? When it 's a parent .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>William , I want to talk seriously . Do you know that when you died you left a lot of debts I did n't know about ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
    <p>I did n't know about them either , my dear . But if you had , it would n't have made any difference .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Yes , it would ! I gave you a very expensive funeral .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
    <p>That was to please yourself , my dear ; it did n't concern me .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Have you no self-respect ? I 've been at my own funeral to-day , let me tell you !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
    <p>Have you , my dear ? Rather trying , was n't that ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Yes , it was . They 've gone and put me beside you ; and now I begin to wish they had n't !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
    <p>Go and haunt them for it !<stage>At this Julia deigns a slight chuckle .</stage>LAURA<stage>abruptly getting back to her own</stage>I had to go into a smaller house , William . And people knew it was because you 'd left me badly off .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
    <p>That reflected on me , my dear , not on you .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>It reflected on me for ever having married you .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
    <p>I 've often heard you blame yourself . Well , now you 're free .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>I 'm not free .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>You can be if you like . Had n't you better ?</l>

     <stage>sentimentally</stage>
     <l>Do n't you see I 'm still in mourning for you ,</l>
     <l>William ?</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
    <p>I appreciate the compliment , my dear . Do n't spoil it .</p>
   </sp>

    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Do n't be heartless !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
    <p>I 'm not : far from it .<stage>He looks at his watch .</stage>I 'm afraid I must go now .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Why must you go ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
    <p>They are expecting me — to dinner .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Who 's ‘ they ’ ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
    <p>The children and their mother . They 've invited me to stay the night .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>Mrs. James does her best to conceal the shock this gives her . She delivers her ultimatum with judicial firmness .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>William , I wish you to come and live here with me .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>William vanishes . Mrs. James in a fervour of virtuous indignation hastens to the door , opens it , and calls ‘ William ! ’ but there is no answer .</stage>
   <stage>Julia , meanwhile , has rung the bell . Mrs. James stills stands glowering in the door-way when she hears footsteps , and moves majestically aside for the returned penitent to enter ; but alas ! it is only Hannah , obedient to the summons of the bell . Mrs. James faces round and fires a shot at her .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Hannah , you are an ugly woman . JULIA<stage>faint with horror</stage>Laura ! HANNAH<stage>imperturbably</stage>Well , Ma'am , I 'm as God made me .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Yes , please , take the tea-things .<stage>Sotto voce , as Hannah approaches .</stage>I 'm sorry , Hannah !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>HANNAH</speaker>
    <p>It does n't matter , Ma'am .<stage>She picks up the tray expeditiously and carries it off .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <stage>Mrs. James eyes the departing tray , and is again reminded of something .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Julia , where is the silver tea-pot ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Which , Laura ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Why , that beautiful one of our Mother 's .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>When we shared our dear Mother 's things between us , did n't Martha have it ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Yes , she did . But she tells me she does n't know what 's become of it . When I ask , what did she do with it in the first place ? she loses her temper . But once she told me she left it here with you .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>The fierce eye and the accusing tone make no impression on that cushioned fortress of gentility . With suave dignity Miss Robinson makes chaste denial .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>No . LAURA<stage>insistent</stage>Yes ; in a box .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>In a box ? Oh , she may have left anything in a box .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>It was that box she always travelled about with and never opened . Well , I looked in it once<stage>never mind how</stage>, and the tea-pot was n't there . JULIA<stage>gently , making allowance</stage>Well , I did n't look in it , Laura .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>Like a water-lily folding its petals she adjusts a small shawl about her shoulders , and sinks composedly into her chair .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>The more fool you ! . . . But all the other things she had of our Mother 's were there : a perfect magpie 's nest ! And she , living in her boxes , and never settling anywhere . What did she want with them ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>I can n't say , Laura .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>No — no more can I ; no more can anyone ! Martha has got the miser spirit . She 's as grasping as a caterpillar . I ought to have had that tea-pot .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Why ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Because I had a house of my own , and people coming to tea . Martha never had anyone to tea with her in her life — except in lodgings .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>We all like to live in our own way . Martha liked going about .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Yes . She promised me , after William — I suppose I had better say ‘ evaporated ’ as you wo n't let me say ‘ died ’ — she promised always to stay with me for three months in the year . She never did . Two , and some little bits , were the most . And I want to know where was that tea-pot all the time ? JULIA<stage>a little jocosely</stage>Not in the box , apparently . LAURA<stage>returning to her accusation</stage>I thought you had it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>You were mistaken . Had I had it here , you would have found it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Did Martha never tell you what she did with it ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>I never asked , Laura .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Julia , if you say that again I shall scream .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Wo n't you take your things off ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Presently . When I feel more at home .</l>
     <stage>Returning to the charge .</stage>
     <l>But most of our Mother 's things are here .</l>

    <p>Your share and mine .</p>

    <p>How did you get mine here ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>You brought them . At least , they came , a little before you did . Then I knew you were on your way . LAURA<stage>impressed</stage>Lor ’ ! So that 's how things happen ?<stage>She goes and begins to take a look round , and Julia takes up her crochet again . As she does so her eye is arrested by a little old-fashioned hour-glass standing upon the table from which the tea-tray has been taken , the sands of which are still running .</stage>JULIA<stage>softly , almost to herself</stage>Oh , but how strange ! That was Martha 's . Is Martha coming too ?<stage>She picks up the glass , looks at it , and sets it down again .</stage>LAURA<stage>who is examining the china on a side-table</stage>Why , I declare , Julia ! Here is your Dresden that was broken — without a crack in it !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>No , Laura , it was yours that was broken .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>It was not mine ; it was yours . . . . Do n't you remember I broke it ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>When you broke it you said it was mine . Until you broke it , you said it was yours .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Very well , then : as you wish . It is n't broken now , and it 's mine .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>That 's satisfactory . I get my own back again . It 's the better one .</l>
     <stage>ENTER Hannah with a telegram on a salver .</stage>
     <l>HANNAH</l>
     <stage>in a low voice of mystery</stage>
     <l>A telegram , Ma'am .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <stage>Julia opens it . The contents evidently startle her , but she retains her presence of mind .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>No answer .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>EXIT Hannah .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Laura , Martha is coming !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Here ? Well , I wonder how she has managed that !</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>Her sister hands her the telegram , which she reads .</stage>
   <stage>‘ Accident . Quite safe . Arriving by the 6. 30 . ’ Why , it 's after that now ! JULIA ( sentimentally ) . Oh , Laura , only think ! So now we shall be all together again .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Yes , I suppose we shall .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>It will be quite like old days . LAURA<stage>warningly , as she sits down again and prepares for narrative</stage>Not quite , Julia .<stage>She leans forward , and speaks with measured emphasis .</stage>Martha 's temper has got very queer ! She never had a very good temper , as you know : and it 's grown on her .<stage>A pause . Julia remains silent .</stage>I could tell you some things ; but ——<stage>Seeing herself unencouraged</stage>oh , you 'll find out soon enough !<stage>Then , to stand right with herself</stage>Julia , am I difficult to get on with ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Oh well , we all have our little ways , Laura .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>But Martha : she 's so rude ! I can n't introduce her to people ! If anyone comes , she just runs away . JULIA<stage>changing the subject</stage>D'you remember , Laura , that charming young girl we met at Mrs. Somervale 's , the summer Uncle Fletcher stayed with us ? LAURA<stage>snubbingly</stage>I can n't say I do .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>I met her the other day : married , and with three children — and just as pretty and young-looking as ever .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>All this is said with the most ravishing air , but Laura is not to be diverted .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Ah ! I daresay . When Martha behaves like that , I hold my tongue and say nothing . But what people must think , I do n't know . Julia , when you first came here , did you find old friends and acquaintances ? Did anybody recognise you ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>A few called on me : nobody I did n't wish to see .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Is that odious man who used to be our next-door neighbour — the one who played on the ‘ cello — here still ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Mr. Harper ? I see him occasionally . I do n't find him odious .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Do n't you ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>It was his wife who was the —— She is n't here : and I do n't think he wants her .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Where is she ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>I did n't ask , Laura .<stage>Mrs. James gives a jerk of exasperation , but at that moment the bell rings and a low knock is heard .</stage>JULIA<stage>ecstatically</stage>Here she is !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Julia , I wonder how it is Martha survived us . She 's much the oldest . JULIA<stage>pleasantly palpitating</stage>Does it matter ? Does it matter ?</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>The door opens and in comes Martha . She has neither the distinction of look nor the force of character which belongs to her two sisters . Age has given a depression to the plain kindliness of her face , and there is a harassed look about her eyes . She peeps into the room a little anxiously , then enters , carrying a large flat box covered in purple paper which , in her further progress across the room she lays upon the table . She talks in short jerks and has a quick , hurried way of doing things , as if she liked to get through and have done with them . It is the same when she submits herself to the embrace of her relations .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Oh , so you 've come at last . Quite time , too !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>Yes , here I am .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>My dear Martha , welcome to your old home !<stage>Embracing her .</stage>How are you ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>I 'm cold . Well , Laura .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>Between these two the embrace is less cordial , but it takes place .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>How did you come ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>I do n't know . JULIA<stage>seeing harassment in her sister 's eye</stage>Arrived safely , at any rate .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>I think I was in a railway accident , but I can n't be sure . I only heard the crash and people shouting . I did n't wait to see . I just put my fingers in my ears , and ran away .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Why do you think it was a railway accident ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>Because I was in a railway carriage . I was coming to your funeral . If you 'd told me you were ill I 'd have come before . I was bringing you a wreath . And then , as I tell you , there was a crash and a shout ; and that 's all I know about it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Lor ’ , Martha ! I suppose they 'll have an inquest on you . MARTHA<stage>stung</stage>I think they 'd better mind their own business , and you mind yours !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Laura ! Here we do n't talk about such things . They do n't concern us . Would you like tea , Martha , or will you wait for supper ? MARTHA<stage>who has shaken her head at the offer of tea , and nodded a preference for supper</stage>You know how I 've always dreaded death .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Oh , do n't , my dear Martha ! It 's past .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>Yes ; but it 's upset me . The relief , that 's what I can n't get over : the relief !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Presently you will be more used to it .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>She helps her off with her cloak .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>There were people sitting to right and to left of me and opposite ; and suddenly a sort of crash of darkness seemed to come all over me , and I saw nothing more . I did n't feel anything : only a sort of a jar here .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>She indicates the back of her neck . Julia finds these anatomical details painful , and holds her hands deprecatingly ; but Laura has no such qualms . She is now undoing the parcel which , she considers , is hers .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>I daresay it was only somebody 's box from the luggage-rack . I 've known that happen . I do n't suppose for a minute that it was a railway accident .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>She unfurls the tissue paper of the box and takes out the wreath .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Why talk about it ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Anyway , nothing has happened to these . ‘ With fondest love from</l>
     <l>Martha . ’ H 'm . Pretty !</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Martha , would you like to go upstairs with your things ? And you ,</l>
     <l>Laura ?</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>I will presently , when I 've got warm .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Not yet . Martha , why was I put into that odious shaped coffin ? More like a canoe than anything . I said it was to be straight .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>I 'd nothing to do with it , Laura . I was n't there . You know I was n't .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>If you 'd come when I asked you , you could have seen to it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>You did n't tell me you were dying .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Do people tell each other when they are dying ? They do n't know . I told you I was n't well .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>You always told me that , just when I 'd settled down somewhere else . . . . Of course I 'd have come if I 'd known !<stage>testily</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Oh , surely we need n't go into these matters now ! Is n't it better to accept things ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>I like to have my wishes attended to . What was going to be done about the furniture ?<stage>This to Martha .</stage>You know , I suppose , that I left it to the two of you — you and Edwin ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>We were going to give it to Bella , to set up house with .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>That 's not what I intended . I meant you to keep on the house and live there . Why could n't you ? MARTHA<stage>with growing annoyance</stage>Well , that 's settled now !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>It was n't for Arabella . Arabella was never a favourite of mine . Why should Arabella have my furniture ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>Well , you 'd better send word , and have it stored up for you till doomsday ! Edwin does n't want it ; he 's got enough of his own . LAURA<stage>in a sleek , injured voice</stage>Julia , I 'm going upstairs to take my things off .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Very well , Laura .</l>
     <stage>And Laura makes her injured exit .</stage>
     <l>So you 've been with Edwin , and his family ?</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>Yes . I 'm never well there ; but I wanted the change .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>You mean , you had been staying with Laura ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>I always go and stay with her , as long as I can — three months ,</l>
     <l>I 'm supposed to . But this year — well , I could n't manage with it .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Is she so much more difficult than she used to be ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>Of course , I do n't know what she 's like here .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Oh , she has been very much herself — poor Laura !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>I know ! Julia , I know ! And I try to make allowances . All her life she 's had her own way with somebody . Poor William ! Of course I know he had his faults . But he used to come and say to me : ‘ Martha , I can n't please her . ’ Well , poor man , he 's at peace now , let 's hope ! Oh , Julia , I 've just thought : whatever will poor William do ? He 's here , I suppose , somewhere ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Oh yes . He 's here , Martha .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>She 'll rout him out , depend on it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>She has routed him out . MARTHA<stage>awe-struck</stage>Has she ? JULIA<stage>shaking her head wisely</stage>William wo n't live with her ; he knows better .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>Who will live with her , then ? She 's bound to get hold of somebody .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Apparently she means to live here .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>Then it 's going to be me ! I know it 's going to be me ! When we lived here before , it used to be poor Mamma .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>The dear Mother is quite capable of looking after herself , you 'll find . You need n't belong to Laura if you do n't like , Martha . I never let her take possession of me .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>She seems never to want to . I do n't know how you manage it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Oh , we 've had our little tussles . But here you will find it much easier . You can vanish .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>What do you mean ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>I mean — vanish . It takes the place of wings . One does it almost without knowing .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>How do you do it ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>You just wish yourself elsewhere ; and you come back when you like .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>Have you ever done it ? JULIA<stage>with a world of meaning</stage>Not yet .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>She wo n't like it . One does n't belong to one 's self , when she 's about — nor does anything . I 've had to hide my own things from her sometimes .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>I should n't wonder .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>Do you remember the silver tea-pot ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>I 've been reminded of it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>It was mine , was n't it ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Oh , of course .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>Laura never would admit it was mine . She wanted it ; so I 'd no right to it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>I had a little idea that was it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>For years she was determined to have it : and I was determined she should n't have it . And she did n't have it !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Who did have it ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>Henrietta was to . I sent it her as a wedding-present , and told her Laura was never to know . And , as she was in Australia , that seemed safe . Well , the ship it went out in was wrecked — all because of that tea-pot , I believe ! So now it 's at the bottom of the sea !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Destiny !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>She searched my boxes to try and find it : stole my keys ! I missed them , but I did n't dare say anything . I used to wrap it in my night-gown and hide it in the bed during the day , and sleep with it under my pillow at night . And I was so thankful when Henrietta got married ; so as to be rid of it !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Hush !</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>RE-ENTER Mrs. James , her bonnet still on , with the strings dangling , and her cloak on her arm .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Julia I 've been looking at your room in there . JULIA<stage>coldly</stage>Have you , Laura ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>It used to be our Mother 's room .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>I do n't need to be reminded of that : it is why I chose it .<stage>Rising gracefully from her chair , she goes to attend to the fire .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Do n't you think it would be much better for you to give it up , and let our Mother come back and live with us ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>She has never expressed the wish .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Of course not , with you in it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>She was not in it when I came .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>How could you expect it , in a house all by herself ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>I gave her the chance : I began by occupying my own room . LAURA<stage>self-caressingly</stage>I was n't here then . That did n't occur to you , I suppose ? You seem to forget you were n't the only one .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Kind of you to remind me .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Saucy .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Martha , will you excuse me ?<stage>Polite to the last , she vanishes gracefully away from the vicinity of the coal-box . The place where she has been stooping knows her no more .</stage>LAURA<stage>rushing round the intervening table to investigate</stage>Julia !</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>Martha is quite as much surprised as Mrs. James , but less indignant .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>Well ! Did you ever ? LAURA<stage>facing about after vain search</stage>Does she think that is the proper way to behave to me ? Julia !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>It 's no good , Laura . You know Julia , as well as I do . If she makes up her mind to a thing ——</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Yes . She 's been waiting here to exercise her patience on me , and now she 's happy ! Well , she 'll have to learn that this house does n't belong to her any longer . She has got to accommodate herself to living with others . . . . I wonder how she 'd like me to go and sit in that pet chair of hers ? JULIA<stage>softly reappearing in the chair which the ‘ dear Mother ’ usually occupies</stage>You can go and sit in it if you wish , Laura . LAURA<stage>ignoring her return</stage>Martha , do you remember that odious man who used to live next door , who played the ‘ cello on Sundays ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>Oh yes , I remember . They used to hang out washing in the garden , did n't they ? LAURA<stage>very scandalously</stage>Julia is friends with him ! They call on each other . His wife does n't live with him any longer .<stage>Julia rises and goes slowly and majestically out of the room .</stage>LAURA<stage>after relishing what she conceives to be her rout of the enemy</stage>Martha , what do you think of Julia ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>Oh , she 's —— What do you want me to think ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>High and mighty as ever , is n't she ? She 's been here by herself so long she thinks the whole place is hers .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>I daresay we shall settle down well enough presently . Which room are you sleeping in ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Of course , I have my old one . Where do you want to go ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>The green room will suit me .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>And Julia means to keep our Mother 's room : I can see that . No wonder she wo n't come and stay .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>Have you seen her ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>She just ‘ looked in , ’ as Julia calls it . I could see she 'd hoped to find me alone . Julia always thought she was the favourite . I knew better .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>How was she ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Just her old self ; but as if she missed something . It was n't a happy face , until I spoke to her : then it all brightened up . . . . Oh , thank you for the wreath , Martha . Where did you get it ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>Emily made it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>That fool ! Then she made her own too , I suppose ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>Yes . That went the day before , so you got it in time .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>I thought it did n't look up to much .<stage>She is now contemplating Emily 's second effort with a critical eye .</stage>Now a little maiden-hair fern would have made a world of difference .</p>

    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>I do n't hold with flowers myself . I think it 's wasteful . But , of course , one has to do it . LAURA<stage>with pained regret</stage>I 'm sorry , Martha ; I return it — with many thanks .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>What 's the good of that ? I can n't give it back to Emily , now ! LAURA<stage>with quiet grief</stage>I do n't wish to be a cause of waste .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>Well , take it to pieces , then ; and put them in water — or wear it round your head !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Ten beautiful wreaths my friends sent me . They are all lying on my grave now ! A pity that love is so wasteful ! Well , I suppose I must go now and change into my cap .<stage>Goes to the door , where she encounters Julia .</stage>Why , Julia , you nearly knocked me down ! JULIA<stage>ironically</stage>I beg your pardon , Laura ; it comes of using the same door . Hannah has lighted a fire in your room .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>That 's sensible at any rate .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>EXIT Mrs. James .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Well ? And how do you find Laura ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>Julia , I do n't know whether I can stand her .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>She has n't got quite — used to herself yet . MARTHA<stage>explosively</stage>Put that away somewhere !</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>She gives an angry shove to the wreath .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Put it away ! Why ? MARTHA<stage>furiously</stage>Emily made it : and it did n't cost anything ; and it has n't got any maiden-hair fern in it ; and it 's too big to wear with her cap . So it 's good for nothing ! Put it on the fire ! She does n't want to see it again . JULIA<stage>comprehending the situation , restores the wreath to its box</stage>Why did you bring it here , Martha ? MARTHA<stage>miserably</stage>I do n't know . I just clung on to it . I suppose it was on my mind to look after it , and see it was n't damaged . So I found I 'd brought it with me . . . . I believe , now I think of it , I 've brought some sandwiches , too .<stage>She routs in a small hand-bag .</stage>Yes , I have . Well , I can have them for supper . . . . Emily made those too .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Then I think you 'd better let Hannah have them — for the sake of peace . MARTHA<stage>woefully</stage>I thought I was going to have peace here .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>It will be all right , Martha — presently .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>Well , I do n't want to be uncharitable ; but I do wish — I must say it — I do wish Laura had been cremated .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>This is the nearest she can do for wishing her sister in the place to which she thinks she belongs . But the uncremated Mrs. James now re-enters in widow 's cap .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Julia , have you ever seen Papa , since you came here ? JULIA<stage>frigidly</stage>No , I have not .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Has our Mother seen him ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>I have n't ——<stage>About to say the forbidden thing , she checks herself .</stage>Mamma has not seen him : nor does she know his whereabouts .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Does nobody know ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Nobody that I know of .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Well , but he must be somewhere . Is there no way of finding him ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Perhaps you can devise one . I suppose , if we chose , we could go to him ; but I 'm not sure — as he does n't come to us .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Lor ’ , Julia ! Suppose he should be ——</l>
     <l>JULIA</l>
     <stage>deprecatingly</stage>
     <l>Oh , Laura !</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>But , Julia , it 's very awkward , not to know where one 's own father is . Do n't people ever ask ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Never , I 'm thankful to say .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Why not ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Perhaps they know better . LAURA<stage>after a pause</stage>I 'm afraid he did n't lead a good life .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>Oh , why can n't you let the thing be ? If you do n't remember him , I do . I was fond of him . He was always very kind to us as children ; and if he did run away with the governess it was a good riddance — so far as she was concerned . We hated her .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>I wonder whether they are together still . You have n't inquired after her , I suppose ? JULIA<stage>luxuriating in her weariness</stage>I — have — not , Laura !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Do n't you think it 's our solemn duty to inquire ? I shall ask our</l>
     <l>Mother .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>I hope you will do nothing of the sort .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>But we ought to know : otherwise we do n't know how to think of him , whether with mercy and pardon for his sins , or with reprobation . MARTHA<stage>angrily</stage>Why need you think ? Why can n't you leave him alone ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>An immortal soul , Martha . It 's no good leaving him alone : that wo n't alter facts .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>I do n't think this is quite a nice subject for discussion .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Nice ? Was it ever intended to be nice ? Eternal punishment was n't provided as a consolation prize for anybody , so far as I know .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>I think it 's very horrible — for us to be sitting here — by the fire , and —<stage>But theology is not Martha 's strong point</stage>Oh ! why can n't you leave it ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Because it 's got to be faced ; and I mean to face it . Now , Martha , do n't try to get out of it . We have got to find our Father .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>I think , before doing anything , we ought to consult Mamma .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Very well ; call her and consult her ! You were against it just now .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>I am against it still . It 's all so unnecessary .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>Lor ’ , there is Mamma !</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>Old Mrs. Robinson is once more in her place Martha makes a move toward her .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Do n't , Martha . She does n't like to be ——</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. R</speaker>
    <p>I 've heard what you 've been talking about . No , I have n't seen him . I 've tried to get him to come to me , but he did n't seem to want . Martha , my dear , how are you ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>Oh , I 'm — much as usual . And you , Mother ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. R</speaker>
    <p>Well , what about your Father ? Who wants him ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>I want him , Mother .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. R</speaker>
    <p>What for ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>First we want to know what sort of a life he is leading . Then we want to ask him about his will .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Oh , Laura !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>I do n't . I do n't care if he made a dozen .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>So I thought if we all called him . You heard when I called , did n't you ? Oh no , that was William .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. R</speaker>
    <p>Who 's William ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Did n't you know I was married ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. R</speaker>
    <p>No . Did he die ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Well , now , could n't we call him ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. R</speaker>
    <p>I daresay . He wo n't like it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>He must . He belongs to us .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. R</speaker>
    <p>Yes , I suppose — as I would n't divorce him , though he wanted me to . I said marriages were made in Heaven .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>A VOICE</speaker>
    <p>Luckily , they do n't last there .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>Greatly startled , they look around , and perceive presently in the mirror over the mantelpiece the apparition of a figure which they seem dimly to recognise . A tall , florid gentleman of the Dundreary type , with long side-whiskers , and dressed in the fashion of sixty years ago , has taken up his position to one side of the ormolu clock ; standing , eye-glass in eye , with folded arms resting on the mantel-slab and a stylish hat in one hand , he gazes upon the assembled family with quizzical benevolence .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. R</speaker>
    <p><stage>placidly</stage>What , is that you , Thomas ? THOMAS<stage>with the fashionable lisp of the fifties , always substituting ‘ th ’ for ‘ s ’</stage>How do you do , Susan ?</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>There follows a pause , broken courageously by Mrs. James .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Are you my Father ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THOMAS</speaker>
    <p>I do n't know . Who are you ? Who are all of you ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Perhaps I had better explain . This is our dear Mother : her you recognise . You are her husband ; we are your daughters . This is Martha , this is Julia , and I 'm Laura .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THOMAS</speaker>
    <p>Is this true , Susan ? Are these our progeny ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. R</speaker>
    <p>Yes — that is — yes , Thomas .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THOMAS</speaker>
    <p>I should not have known it . They all look so much older .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Than when you left us ? Naturally !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THOMAS</speaker>
    <p>Than me , I meant . But you all seem flourishing .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Because we lived longer . Papa , when did you die ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Oh ! Laura !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THOMAS</speaker>
    <p>I do n't know , child .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Do n't know ? How do n't you know ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THOMAS</speaker>
    <p>Because in prisons , and other lunatic asylums , one is n't allowed to know anything .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. R</speaker>
    <p>A lunatic asylum ! Oh , Thomas , what brought you there ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THOMAS</speaker>
    <p>A damned life , Susan — with you , and others .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Oh , Laura , why did you do this ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>If this goes on , I shall leave the room .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Where are those others now ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THOMAS</speaker>
    <p>Three of them I see before me . You , Laura , used to scream horribly . When you were teething , I was sleepless . Your Mother insisted on having you in the room with us . No wonder I went elsewhere .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>I 'm going !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THOMAS</speaker>
    <p>Do n't , Martha ! You were the quietest of the lot . When you were two years old I even began to like you . You were the exception .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Have n't you any affection for your old home ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THOMAS</speaker>
    <p>None . It was a prison . You were the gaolers and the turnkeys . To keep my feet in the domestic way you made me wool-work slippers , and I had to wear them . You gave me neckties , which I would n't wear . You gave me affection of a demanding kind , which I did n't want . You gave me a moral atmosphere which I detested . And at last I could bear it no more , and I escaped . LAURA<stage>deaf to instruction</stage>Papa , we wish you and our dear Mother to come back and live with us .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THOMAS</speaker>
    <p>Live with my grandmother ! How could I live with any of you ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Where are you living ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THOMAS</speaker>
    <p>Ask no questions , and you will be told no lies .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Where is she ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THOMAS</speaker>
    <p>Which she ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>The governess .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THOMAS</speaker>
    <p>Which governess ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>The one you went away with .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THOMAS</speaker>
    <p>D'you want her back again ? You can have her . She 'll teach you a thing or two . She did me .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Then — you have repented , Papa ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THOMAS</speaker>
    <p>God ! why did I come here ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. R</speaker>
    <p>Yes ; why did you come ? It was weak of you .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THOMAS</speaker>
    <p>Because I never could resist women .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Were you really mad when you died , Papa ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THOMAS</speaker>
    <p>Yes , and am still : stark , staring , raving , mad , like all the rest of you .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>I am not aware that I am mad .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THOMAS</speaker>
    <p>Then you are a bad case . Not to know it , is the worst sign of all . It 's in the family : you can n't help being . Everything you say and do proves it . . . . You were mad to come here . You are mad to remain here . You were mad to want to see me . I was mad to let you see me . I was mad at the mere sight of you ; and I 'm mad to be off again ! Goodbye , Susan . If you send for me again , I sha n't come !</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>He puts on his hat with a flourish .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Where are you going , Father ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>THOMAS</speaker>
    <p>To Hell , child ! Your Hell , my Heaven !</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>He spreads his arms and rises up through the looking-glass ; you see his violet frock-coat , his check trousers , his white spats , and patent-leather boots ascending into and passing from view . He twiddles his feet at them and vanishes .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>And now I hope you are satisfied , Laura ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>Where 's Mamma gone ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>So you 've driven her away , too . Well , that finishes it .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>Apparently it does . Robbed of her parental prey , Mrs. James reverts to the next dearest possession she is concerned about .</stage>

    <p>Martha , where is the silver tea-pot ?</p>

    <p>I do n't know , Laura .</p>
   </sp>

    <p>You said Julia had it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>I did n't say anything of the sort ! You said — you supposed Julia had it ; and I said — suppose she had ! And I left it at that .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Julia says she has n't got it , so you must have it .</p>

    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>I have n't !</p>

    <p>I do n't know any more than Julia knows .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Then one of you is not telling the truth . . . .<stage>Very judicially she begins to examine the two culprits .</stage>Julia , when did you last see it ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>On the day , Laura , when we shared things between us . It became</l>

   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Martha , when did you last see it ?</p>

    <p>I have not seen it — for I do n't know how long .</p>

    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>I 've given you a reasonable answer !

   <stage>Julia , who has her eye on Martha , and is quite enjoying this tussle of the two says nothing .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
    <p>You and Julia can discuss it . I am going downstairs .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>Mrs. James crosses the room , locks the door , and , standing mistress of all she surveys , inquires with grim humour .</stage>

    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>And where are you going to be , Julia ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>I am where I am , Laura . I 'm not going out of the window , or up the chimney , if that 's what you mean .</p>

   <stage>She continues gracefully to do her crochet .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Now , Martha , if you please . MARTHA<stage>goaded into victory</stage>I 'm sorry , Julia . You 'd better explain . I 'm going downstairs .</p>

    <p>Martha ! . . . Am I to be defied in this way ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>You brought it on yourself , Laura .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>You told her to do it !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>She would have soon found out for herself .<stage>Collectedly , she folds up her work and rises .</stage>And now , I think , I will go to my room and wash my hands for supper .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>As she makes her stately move , her ear is attracted by a curious metallic sound repeated at intervals . Turning about , she perceives , indeed they both perceive , in the centre of the small table , a handsome silver tea-pot which opens and shuts its lid at them , as if trying to speak .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>Oh , look , Laura ! Martha 's tea-pot has arrived .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>She told a lie , then .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>No , it was the truth . She wished for it . The sea has given up its dead .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Then now I have got it at last !<stage>But , as she goes to seize the disputed possession , Martha rises through the floor , grabs the tea-pot , and descends to the nether regions once more .</stage>LAURA<stage>glaring at her sister with haggard eye</stage>Julia , where are we ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>JULIA</speaker>
    <p>I do n't know what you mean , Laura .<stage>She reaches out a polite hand .</stage>The key ?</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>Mrs. James delivers up the key as one glad to be rid of it .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>What is this place we 've come to ? JULIA<stage>persuasively</stage>Our home .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>I think we are in Hell ! JULIA<stage>going to the door , which she unlocks with soft triumph</stage>We are all where we wish to be , Laura .<stage>A gong sounds .</stage>That 's supper .<stage>The gong continues its metallic bumbling .</stage><stage>Julia departs , leaving Mrs. James in undisputed possession of the situation she has made for herself .</stage>CURTAIN Printed by Hazell , Watson &amp; Viney , Ld ., London and Aylesbury .</p>
