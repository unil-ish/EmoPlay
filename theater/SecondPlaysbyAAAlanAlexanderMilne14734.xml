    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">Encouraged by the reviewer who announced that the Introduction to my previous collection of plays was the best part of the book , I venture to introduce this collection in a similar manner . But I shall be careful not to overdo it this time , in the hope that I may win from my critic some such tribute as , “ Mr. Milne has certainly improved as a dramatist , in that his plays are now slightly better than his Introduction . ”</p>
    <p n="2">Since , then , I am trying to make this preface as distasteful as possible , in order that the plays may shine out the more pleasantly , I shall begin ( how better ? ) with an attack on the dramatic critics . I will relate a little conversation which took place , shortly after the publication of “ First Plays , ” between myself and a very much more eminent dramatist .</p>
    <p n="3">EMINENT DRAMATIST ( kindly ) Your book seems to have been well reviewed .</p>
    <p n="4">MYSELF ( ungratefully ) . Not bad — by those who reviewed it . But I doubt if it was noticed by more than three regular dramatic critics . And considering that two of the plays in it had never been produced —</p>
    <p n="5">EMINENT DRAMATIST ( amused by my innocence ) . My dear fellow , you need n't complain . I published an unproduced play a little while ago , and it did n't get a single notice from anybody .</p>
    <p n="6">Now I hope that , however slightly the conversations in the plays which follow may move the dramatic critic , he will at least be disturbed by this little dialogue . All of us who are interested in the theatre are accustomed to read , and sometimes to make , ridiculous accusations against the Theatrical Manager . We condemn the mercenary fellow because he will not risk a loss of two or three thousand pounds on the intellectual masterpiece of a promising young dramatist , preferring to put on some contemptible but popular rubbish which is certain to fill his theatre . But now we see that the dramatic critic , that stern upholder of the best interests of the British Drama , will not himself risk six shillings ( and perhaps two or three hours of his time ) in order to read the intellectual masterpiece of the promising young dramatist , and so to be able to tell us with authority whether the Manager really is refusing masterpieces or no . He will not risk six shillings in order to encourage that promising young dramatist — discouraged enough already , poor devil , in his hopes of fame and fortune — by telling him that he is right , and that his plays are worth something , or ( alternatively ) to prevent him from wasting any more of his youth upon an art-form to which he is not suited . No , he will not risk his shillings ; but he will write an important ( and , let us hope , well-rewarded ) article , informing us that the British Drama is going to the dogs , and that no promising young dramatist is ever given a fair chance .</p>
    <p n="7">Absurd , is n't it ?</p>
    <p n="8">Let us consider this young dramatist for a moment , and ask ourselves why he goes on writing his masterpieces . I give three reasons — in their order of importance .</p>
    <p n="9">( 1 ) The pleasure of writing ; or , more accurately , the hell of not writing . He gets this anyhow .</p>
   </div>
   <titlePage>
    <docImprint>( 2 ) The appreciation of his peers ; his hope of immortality ; the criticism of the experts ; fame , publicity , notoriety , swank , réclame — call it what you will . But it is obvious that he cannot have it unless the masterpiece is given to the world , either by manager or publisher . ( 3 ) Money . If the masterpiece is published only , very little ; if produced , possibly a great deal . As I say , he gets his first reward anyhow . But let us be honest with ourselves . How many of us would write our masterpieces on a desert island , with no possibility of being rescued ? Well , perhaps all of us ; for we should feel that , even if not rescued ourselves , our manuscripts — written on bark with a burnt stick — clutched in a skeleton hand — might be recovered later by some literary sea-captain . ( As it might be , Conrad . ) But how many of us would write masterpieces if we had to burn them immediately afterwards , or if we were alone upon the world , the last survivors of a new flood ? Could we bear to write ? Could we bear not to write ? It is not fair to ask us . But we can admit this much without reserve ; it is the second reward which tears at us , and , lacking it , we should lose courage . So when the promising young dramatist has his play refused by the Managers — after what weeks , months , years of hope and fear , uncertainty and bitter disappointment — he has this great consolation : “ Anyway , I can always publish it . ” Perhaps , after a dozen refusals , a Manager offers to put on his play , on condition that he alters the obviously right ( and unhappy ) ending into the obviously foolish , but happy , ending which will charm the public . Does he , the artist , succumb ? How easy to tell himself that he must get his play before the public somehow , and that , even if it is not his play now , yet the first two acts are as he wrote them , and that , if only to feel the thrill of the audience at that great scene between the Burglar and the Bishop ( his creations ! ) he must deaden his conscience to the absurdity of a happy ending . But does he succumb ? No . Heroically he tells himself : “ Anyway , I can publish it ; and I 'm certain that the critics will agree with me that —— ” But the critics are too busy to bother about him . They are busy informing the world that the British Drama is going to the dogs , and that no promising young dramatist ever gets a fair chance . Let me say here that I am airing no personal grievance . I doubt if any dramatist has less right to feel aggrieved against the critics , the managers , the public , the world , than I ; and whatever right I have I renounce , in return for the good things which I have received from them . But I do not renounce the grievance of our craft . I say that , in the case of all dramatists , it is the business of the dramatic critics to review their unacted plays when published . Some of them do ; most of them do not . It is ridiculous for those who do not to pretend that they take any real interest in the British Drama . But I say “ review , ” not “ praise . ” Let them damn , by all means , if the plays are unworthy ; and , by damning , do so much of justice to the Managers who refused them . We can now pass on safely to the plays in this volume . We begin with a children 's play . The difficulty in the way of writing a children 's play is that Barrie was born too soon . Many people must have felt the same about Shakespeare . We who came later have no chance . What fun to have been Adam , and to have had the whole world of plots and jokes and stories at one 's disposal . Possibly , however , one would never have thought of the things . Of course , there are still others to come after us , but our works are not immortal , and they will plagiarise us without protest . Yet I have hopes of Make-Believe , for it had the honour of inaugurating Mr. Nigel Playfair 's management at the Lyric , Hammersmith . It is possible that the historians will remember this , long after they have forgotten my plays ; more likely ( alas ! ) that their history will be dated A. D. ( After Drinkwater ) and that the honour will be given to “ Abraham Lincoln . ” I like to think that in this event my ghost will haunt them . Make-Believe appeared with a Prologue by the Manager , lyrics by C. E . Burton , and music by Georges Dorlay . As the title-page states that this book is , in the language of children 's competitions , “ my own unaided work , ” I print the play with a new Prologue , and without the charming lyrics . But the reader is told when he may burst into an improvisation of his own , though I warn him that he will not make such a good show of it as did my collaborators .</docImprint>

   <performance>Mr. Pim Passes By appeared at several theatres . Let us admit cheerfully that it was a success — in spite of the warning of an important gentleman in the theatrical world , who told me , while I was writing it , that the public would n't stand any talk of bigamy , and suggested that George and Olivia should be engaged only , not married . ( Hence the line , “ Bigamy ! . . . It is an ugly word , ” in the Second Act . ) But , of course , nobody sees more clearly than I how largely its success was due to Mr. Dion Boucicault and Miss Irene Vanbrugh . The Romantic Age appeared first at the Comedy , and ( like Mr. Pim ) found , in its need , a home at The Playhouse . Miss Gladys Cooper has a charming way of withdrawing into a nursing home whenever I want a theatre , but I beg her not to make a habit of it . My plays can be spared so much more easily than she . By the way , a word about Melisande . Many of the critics said that nobody behaved like that nowadays . I am terrified at the thought of arguing with them , for they can always reduce me to blushes with a scornful , “ My dear man , you can n't do that in a play ! ” And when they tell me to remember what Strindberg said in ‘ 93 ( if he were alive then ; I really do n't know ) or what Aristotle wrote in — no , I sha n't even guess at Aristotle , well , then , I want to burst into tears , my ignorance is so profound . So , very humbly , I just say now that , when Melisande talks and behaves in a certain way , I do not mean that a particular girl exists ( Miss Jones , of 999 Bedford Park ) who talks and behaves like this , but I do mean that there is a type of girl who , in her heart , secretly , thinks like this . If , from your great knowledge of the most secret places of a young girl 's heart , you tell me that there is no such type , then I shall only smile . But if you inform me sternly that a dramatist has no business to express an attitude in terms of an actress , then you reduce me to blushes again . For I really know nothing about play-writing , and I am only sustained by two beliefs . The first is that rules are always made for the other people ; the second is that , if a play by me is not obviously by me , and as obviously not by anybody else , then ( obviously ) I had no business to write it . Of the one-act plays , The Camberley Triangle and The Stepmother , nothing much need be said . The former was played at the Coliseum ; the latter , written for Miss Winifred Emery , was deemed by the management too serious for that place of amusement . This , however , was to the great advantage of the play , for now it has appeared only at Charity matinées with an “ all-star ” cast .</performance>

    <docImprint>As before , the plays are printed in the order in which they were written ; in this case between October<date>1918</date>and June<date>1920</date>. May the reader get as much enjoyment from them as I had in their writing . But no ; that is plainly impossible . A. A. MILNE .</docImprint>

      <head>PROLOGUE</head>
      <stage>The playroom of the HUBBARD FAMILY — nine of them . Counting MR. and MRS. HUBBARD , we realize that there are eleven HUBBARDS in all , and you would think that one at least of the two people we see in the room would be a HUBBARD of sorts . But no . The tall manly figure is JAMES , the HUBBARDS ’ butler , for the HUBBARDS are able to afford a butler now . How different from the time when Old Mother Hubbard — called “ old ” because she was at least twenty-two , and “ mother ” because she had a passion for children — could not even find a bone for her faithful terrier ; but , of course , that was before HENRY went into work . Well , the tall figure is JAMES , the butler , and the little one is ROSEMARY , a friend of the HUBBARD FAMILY . ROSEMARY is going in for literature this afternoon , as it 's raining , and JAMES is making her quite comfortable first with pens and ink and blotting-paper — always so important when one wants to write . He has even thought of a stick of violet sealing-wax ; after that there can be no excuse .</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY . Thank you , James . ( She sits down . ) If any one calls I am not at home .</stage>
      <stage>JAMES . Yes , Miss .</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY . You may add that I am engaged in writing my auto — autobiography .</stage>
      <stage>JAMES . Yes , Miss .</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY . It 's what every one writes , is n't it , James ?</stage>
      <stage>JAMES . I believe so , Miss .</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY . Thank you . ( He goes to the door . ) Oh , James ?</stage>
      <stage>JAMES . Yes , Miss ?</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY . What is an autobiography ?</stage>
      <stage>JAMES . Well , I could n't rightly say , Miss — not to explain it properly .</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY ( dismayed ) . Oh , James ! . . . I thought you knew everything .</stage>
      <stage>JAMES . In the ordinary way , yes , Miss , but every now and then ——</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY . It 's very upsetting .</stage>
      <stage>JAMES . Yes , Miss . . . . How would it be to write a play instead ? Very easy work , they tell me .</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY ( nodding ) . Yes , that 's much better . I 'll write a play . Thank you , James .</stage>
      <stage>JAMES . Not at all , Miss . [ He goes out .</stage>
      <stage>( ROSEMARY bites her pen , and thinks deeply . At last the inspiration comes . )</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY ( as she writes ) . Make-Believe . M-a-k-e hyphen B-e-l —— ( she stops and frowns ) Now which way is it ? ( She tries it on the blotting-paper ) That looks wrong . ( She tries it again ) So does that . Oh , dear ! ( She rings the bell . . . JAMES returns . )</stage>
      <stage>JAMES . Yes , Miss ?</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY . James , I have decided to call my play Make-Believe .</stage>
      <stage>JAMES . Yes , Miss .</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY ( carelessly ) . When you spell “ believe , ” it is “ i-e , ” is n't it ?</stage>
      <stage>JAMES . Yes , Miss .</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY . I thought at first it was “ e-i . ”</stage>
      <stage>JAMES . Now you mention it , I think it is , Miss .</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY ( reproachfully ) . Oh , James ! Are n't you certain ?</stage>
      <stage>JAMES . M-a-k-e , make , B-e-l —— ( He stops and scratches his whiskers . )</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY . Yes . I got as far as that .</stage>
      <stage>JAMES . B-e-l ——</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY . You see , James , it spoils the play if you have an accident to the very first word of it .</stage>
      <stage>JAMES . Yes , Miss . B-e-l —— I 've noticed sometimes that if one writes a word careless-like on the blotting-paper , and then looks at it with the head on one side , there 's a sort of instinct comes over one , as makes one say ( with a shake of the head ) “ Rotten . ” One can then write it the other way more hopeful .</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY . I 've tried that .</stage>
      <stage>JAMES . Then might I suggest , Miss , that you give it another name altogether ? As it might be , “ Susan 's Saturday Night , ” all easy words to spell , or “ Red Revenge , ” or ——</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY . I must call it Make-Believe , because it 's all of the play I 've thought of so far .</stage>
      <stage>JAMES . Quite so , Miss . Then how would it be to spell it wrong on purpose ? It comes funnier that way sometimes .</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY . Does it ?</stage>
      <stage>JAMES . Yes , Miss . Makes ‘ em laugh .</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY . Oh ! . . . Well , which is the wrong way ?</stage>
      <stage>JAMES . Ah , there you 've got me again , Miss .</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY ( inspired ) . I know what I 'll do . I 'll spell it “ i-e ” ; and if it 's right , then I 'm right , and if it 's wrong , then I 'm funny .</stage>
      <stage>JAMES . Yes , Miss . That 's the safest .</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY . Thank you , James .</stage>
      <stage>JAMES . Not at all , Miss . [ He goes out .</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY ( writing ) . Make-Believe . A Christmas Entertainment —— ( She stops and thinks , and then shakes her head . ) No , play — a Christmas Play in three acts . Er —— ( She is stuck . )</stage>
      <stage>Enter JAMES .</stage>
      <stage>JAMES . Beg pardon , Miss , but the Misses and Masters Hubbard are without , and crave admittance .</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY . All nine of them ?</stage>
      <stage>JAMES . Without having counted them , Miss , I should say that the majority of them were present .</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY . Did you say that I was not at home ?</stage>
      <stage>JAMES . Yes , Miss . They said that , this being their house , and you being a visitor , if you had been at home , then you would n't have been here . Yumour on the part of Master Bertram , Miss .</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY . It 's very upsetting when you 're writing a play .</stage>
      <stage>JAMES . Yes , Miss . Perhaps they could help you with it . The more the merrier , as you might say .</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY . What a good idea , James . Admit them .</stage>
      <stage>JAMES . Yes , Miss . ( He opens the door and says very rapidly ) The Misses Ada , Caroline , Elsie , Gwendoline , and Isabel Hubbard , The Masters Bertram , Dennis , Frank , and Harold Hubbard . ( They come in . )</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY . How do you do ?</stage>
      <stage>ADA . Rosemary , darling , what are you doing ?</stage>
      <stage>BERTRAM . It 's like your cheek , bagging our room .</stage>
      <stage>CAROLINE ( primly ) . Hush , Bertram . We ought always to be polite to our visitors when they stay with us . I am sure , if Rosemary wants our room ——</stage>
      <stage>DENNIS . Oh , chuck it !</stage>
      <stage>ADA ( at ROSEMARY 'S shoulder ) . Oh , I say , she 's writing a play !</stage>
      <stage>( Uproar and turmoil , as they all rush at ROSEMARY . )</stage>
      <stage>{ THE BOYS . Coo ! I say , shove me into it . What 's { it about ? Bet it 's awful rot . { { THE GIRLS . Oh , Rosemary ! Am I in it ? Do tell us { about it . Is it for Christmas ?</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY ( in alarm ) . James , could you ——?</stage>
      <stage>JAMES ( firmly ) . Quiet , there , quiet ! Down , Master Dennis , down ! Miss Gwendoline , if you would n't mind —— ( He picks her up and places her on the floor . ) Thank you . ( Order is restored . )</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY . Thank you , James . . . . Yes , it 's a play for Christmas , and it is called “ Make-Believe , ” and that 's all I 'm certain about yet , except that we 're all going to be in it .</stage>
      <stage>BERTRAM . Then I vote we have a desert island ——</stage>
      <stage>DENNIS . And pirates ——</stage>
      <stage>FRANK . And cannibals ——</stage>
      <stage>HAROLD ( gloatingly ) . Cannibals eating people — Oo !</stage>
      <stage>CAROLINE ( shocked ) . Harold ! How would you like to be eaten by a cannibal ?</stage>
      <stage>DENNIS . Oh , chuck it ! How would you like to be a cannibal and have nobody to eat ? ( CAROLINE is silent , never having thought of this before . )</stage>
      <stage>ADA . Let it be a fairy-story , Rosemary , darling . It 's so much prettier .</stage>
      <stage>ELSIE . With a lovely princess ——</stage>
      <stage>GWENDOLINE . And a humble woodcutter who marries her ——</stage>
      <stage>ISABEL ( her only contribution ) . P'itty P'incess .</stage>
      <stage>BERTRAM . Princesses are rot .</stage>
      <stage>ELSIE ( with spirit ) . So are pirates ! ( Deadlock . )</stage>
      <stage>CAROLINE . I should like something about Father Christmas , and snow , and waits , and a lovely ball , and everybody getting nice presents and things .</stage>
      <stage>DENNIS ( selfishly , I 'm afraid ) . Bags I all the presents .</stage>
      <stage>( Of course , the others are n't going to have that . They all say so together . )</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY ( above the turmoil ) . James , I must have silence .</stage>
      <stage>JAMES . Silence , all !</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY . Thank you . . . . You will be interested to hear that I have decided to have a Fairy Story and a Desert Island and a Father Christmas .</stage>
      <stage>ALL . Good ! ( Or words to that effect )</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY ( biting her pen ) . I shall begin with the Fairy Story . ( There is an anxious silence . None of them has ever seen anybody writing a play before . How does one do it ? Alas , ROSEMARY herself does n't know . She appeals to JAMES . ) James , how do you begin a play ? I mean when you 've got the title .</stage>
      <stage>JAMES ( a man of genius ) . Well , Miss Rosemary , seeing that it 's to be called “ Make-Believe , ” why not make-believe as it 's written already ?</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY . What a good idea , James !</stage>
      <stage>JAMES . All that is necessary is for the company to think very hard of what they want , and — there we are ! Saves all the bother of writing and spelling and what not .</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY ( admiringly . ) James , how clever you are !</stage>
      <stage>JAMES . So-so , Miss Rosemary .</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY . Now then , let 's all think together . Are you all ready ?</stage>
      <stage>ALL . Yes ! ( They clench their hands . )</stage>
      <stage>ROSEMARY . Then one , two , three — Go !</stage>
      <stage>( They think . . . . The truth is that JAMES , who was n't really meant to be in it , thinks too . If there is anything in the play which you do n't like , it is JAMES thinking . )</stage>

       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>Sometimes I say good-bye .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p>You are a cross woodcutter to-day .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>I have work to do .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p>You are still cutting wood ? Do n't you ever do anything else ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>Well , you are still a Princess ; do n't you ever do anything else ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p><stage>reproachfully</stage>Now , that 's not fair , Woodcutter . You can n't say I was a Princess yesterday , when I came and helped you stack your wood . Or the day before , when I tied up your hand where you had cut it . Or the day before that , when we had our meal together on the grass . Was I a Princess then ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>Somehow I think you were . Somehow I think you were saying to yourself , “ Is n't it sweet of a Princess to treat a mere woodcutter like this ? ”</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p>I think you 're perfectly horrid . I 've a good mind never to speak to you again . And — and I would , if only I could be sure that you would notice I was n't speaking to you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>After all , I 'm just as bad as you . Only yesterday I was thinking to myself how unselfish I was to interrupt my work in order to talk to a mere Princess .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p>Yes , but the trouble is that you do n't interrupt your work .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>interrupting it and going up to her with a smile</stage>Madam , I am at your service .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p>I wish I thought you were .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>Surely you have enough people at your service already . Princes and Chancellors and Chamberlains and Waiting Maids .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p>Yes , that 's just it . That 's why I want your help . Particularly in the matter of the Princes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>Why , has a suitor come for the hand of her Royal Highness ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p>Three suitors . And I hate them all .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>And which are you going to marry ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p>I do n't know . Father has n't made up his mind yet .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>And this is a matter which father — which His Majesty decides for himself ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p>Why , of course ! You should read the History Books , Woodcutter . The suitors to the hand of a Princess are always set some trial of strength or test of quality by the King , and the winner marries his daughter .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>Well , I do n't live in a Palace , and I think my own thoughts about these things . I 'd better get back to my work .<stage>He goes on with his chopping .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p><stage>gently , after a pause</stage>Woodcutter !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking up</stage>Oh , are you there ? I thought you were married by this time .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p><stage>meekly</stage>I do n't want to be married .<stage>Hastily</stage>I mean , not to any of those three .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>You can n't help yourself .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p>I know . That 's why I wanted you to help me .</p>

       <p><stage>going up to her</stage>Can a simple woodcutter help a Princess ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p>Well , perhaps a simple one could n't , but a clever one might .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>What would his reward be ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p>His reward would be that the Princess , not being married to any of her three suitors , would still be able to help him chop his wood in the mornings . . . . I am helping you , are n't I ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>It is kind of a great lady like yourself to help so humble a fellow as I .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p><stage>meekly</stage>I 'm not very great .<stage>And she is n't . She is the smallest , daintiest little Princess that ever you saw .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>There 's enough of you to make a hundred men unhappy .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p>And one man happy ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>And one man very , very happy .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p><stage>innocently</stage>I wonder who he 'll be . . . . Woodcutter , if you were a Prince , would you be my suitor ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>scornfully</stage>One of three ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p><stage>excitedly</stage>Oo , would you kill the others ? With that axe ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>I would not kill them , in order to help His Majesty make up his mind about his son-in-law . But if the Princess had made up her mind — and wanted me ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p>Yes ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>Then I would marry her , however many suitors she had .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p>Well , she 's only got three at present .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>What is that to me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p>Oh , I just thought you might want to be doing something to your axe .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>My axe ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p>Yes . You see , she has made up her mind .</p>

       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>amazed</stage>You mean — But — but I 'm only a woodcutter .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p>That 's where you 'll have the advantage of them , when it comes to axes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>

      </sp>
      <stage>They sing together . They just happen to feel like that</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>the song finished</stage>But what will His Majesty say ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p>All sorts of things . . . . Do you really love me , woodcutter , or have I proposed to you under a misapprehension ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>I adore you !</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p><stage>nodding</stage>I thought you did . But I wanted to hear you say it . If I had been a simple peasant , I suppose you would have said it a long time ago ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>I expect so .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p><stage>nodding</stage>Yes . . . . Well , now we must think of a plan for making Mother like you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>Might I just kiss you again before we begin ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p>Well , I do n't quite see how I am to stop you .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>The WOODCUTTER picks her up in his arms and kisses her .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>There !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p><stage>in his arms</stage>Oh , Woodcutter , woodcutter , why did n't you do that the first day I saw you ? Then I need n't have had the bother of proposing to you .<stage>He puts her down suddenly</stage>What is it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p><stage>listening</stage>Somebody coming .<stage>He peers through the trees and then says in surprise</stage>The King !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p>Oh ! I must fly !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>But you 'll come back ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p>Perhaps .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>She disappears quickly through the trees .</stage>
      <stage>The WOODCUTTER goes on with his work and is discovered at it a minute later by the KING and QUEEN .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>KING</speaker>
       <p><stage>puffing</stage>Ah ! and a seat all ready for us . How satisfying .<stage>They sit down , a distinguished couple — reading from left to right , “ KING , QUEEN ” — on a bench outside the WOODCUTTER 'S hut .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p><stage>crossly — she was like that</stage>I do n't know why you dragged me here .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>KING</speaker>
       <p>As I told you , my love , to be alone .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>Well , you are n't alone .<stage>She indicates the WOODCUTTER .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>KING</speaker>
       <p>Pooh , he does n't matter . . . . Well now , about these three Princes . They are getting on my mind rather . It is time we decided which one of them is to marry our beloved child . The trouble is to choose between them .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>As regards appetite , there is nothing to choose between them . They are three of the heartiest eaters I have met for some time .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>KING</speaker>
       <p>You are right . The sooner we choose one of them , and send the other two about their business , the better .<stage>Reflectively</stage>There were six peaches on the breakfast-table this morning . Did I get one ? No .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>Did I get one ? No .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>KING</speaker>
       <p>Did our darling child get one — not that it matters ? No .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>It is a pity that the seven-headed bull died last year .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>KING</speaker>
       <p>Yes , he had a way of sorting out competitors for the hand of our beloved one that was beyond all praise . One could have felt quite sure that , had the three competitors been introduced to him , only one of them would have taken any further interest in the matter .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p><stage>always the housekeeper</stage>And even he might n't have taken any interest in his meals .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>KING</speaker>
       <p><stage>with a sigh</stage>However , those days are over . We must think of a new test . Somehow I think that , in a son-in-law , moral worth is even more to be desired than mere brute strength . Now my suggestion is this : that you should disguise yourself as a beggar woman and approach each of the three princes in turn , supplicating their charity . In this way we shall discover which of the three has the kindest heart . What do you say , my dear ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>An excellent plan . If you remember , I suggested it myself yesterday .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>KING</speaker>
       <p><stage>annoyed</stage>Well , of course , it had been in my mind for some time . I do n't claim that the idea is original ; it has often been done in our family .<stage>Getting up</stage>Well then , if you will get ready , my dear , I will go and find our three friends and see that they come this way .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>They go out together .</stage>
      <stage>As soon as they are out of sight the PRINCESS comes back .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p>Well , Woodcutter , what did I tell you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>What did you tell me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p>Did n't you listen to what they said ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>I did n't listen , but I could n't help hearing .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p>Well , I could n't help listening . And unless you stop it somehow , I shall be married to one of them to-night .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>Which one ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p>The one with the kindest heart — whichever that is .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>Supposing they all three have kind hearts ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p><stage>confidently</stage>They wo n't . They never have . In our circles when three Princes come together , one of them has a kind heart and the other two have n't .<stage>Surprised</stage>Have n't you read any History at all ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>I have no time for reading . But I think it 's time History was altered a little . We 'll alter it this afternoon .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p>What do you mean ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>Leave this to me . I 've got an idea .</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
       <p>I obey my lord 's commands .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>She blows him a kiss and runs off</stage>
      <stage>The WOODCUTTER resumes his work . By and by the RED PRINCE comes along . He is a — well , you will see for yourself what he is like .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RED PRINCE</speaker>
       <p>Ah , fellow . . . . Fellow ! . . . I said fellow !<stage>Yes , that sort of man .</stage></p>

      <stage>The WOODCUTTER looks round to make sure , peers behind a tree or two , and comes back to the PRINCE .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>Yes , you must have meant me .</p>
      </sp>

       <p>You suggest that I take an unfair advantage over my fellow-competitors ?</p>

       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>I would suggest , my lord , that you should take a short walk in this direction<stage>pointing to the opposite direction to that which the PRINCESS has taken</stage>, and stroll back casually in a few minutes ’ time when the Queen is here .</p>

       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>If you come back in five minutes , you will see a beggar woman sitting here . She will ask you for a crust of bread . You must give it to her , for it is the way His Majesty has chosen of testing your kindness of heart .</p>

       <p>Not at all , I 'm very glad to have been able to help you .</p>

       <speaker>BLUE PRINCE</speaker>
       <p><stage>with a great effort</stage>Thanks .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>He goes slowly away . A moment later the YELLOW PRINCE makes a graceful and languid entry .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YELLOW PRINCE</speaker>
       <p>Ah , come hither , my man , come hither .</p>
      </sp>

       <p><stage>stopping his work and looking up</stage>You want me , sir ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YELLOW PRINCE</speaker>
       <p>Come hither , my man . Tell me , has her Royal Highness the Princess passed this way lately ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>The Princess ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YELLOW PRINCE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , the Princess , my bumpkin . But perhaps you have been too much concerned in your own earthy affairs to have noticed her . You — ah — cut wood , I see .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>Yes , sir , I am a woodcutter .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YELLOW PRINCE</speaker>
       <p>A most absorbing life . Some day we must have a long talk about it . But just now I have other business waiting for me . With your permission , good friend , I will leave you to your faggots .<stage>He starts to go .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>Beg your pardon , sir , but are you one of those Princes that want to marry our Princess ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YELLOW PRINCE</speaker>
       <p>I had hoped , good friend , to obtain your permission to do so . I beg you not to refuse it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>You are making fun of me , sir .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YELLOW PRINCE</speaker>
       <p>Discerning creature .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>All the same , I can help you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YELLOW PRINCE</speaker>
       <p>Then pray do so , log-chopper , and earn my everlasting gratitude .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>The King has decided that whichever of you three Princes has the kindest heart shall marry his daughter .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YELLOW PRINCE</speaker>
       <p>Then you will be able to bear witness to him that I have already wasted several minutes of my valuable time in condescending to a mere faggot-splitter . Tell him this and the prize is mine .<stage>Kissing the tips of his fingers</stage>Princess , I embrace you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>The King will not listen to me . But if you return here in five minutes , you will find an old woman begging for bread . It is the test which their Majesties have arranged for you . If you share your last crust with her —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YELLOW PRINCE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , but do I look as if I carried a last crust about with me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>But see , I will give you one .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YELLOW PRINCE</speaker>
       <p><stage>taking it between the tips of his fingers</stage>Yes , but —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>WOODCUTTER</speaker>
       <p>Put it in your pocket , and when —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YELLOW PRINCE</speaker>
       <p>But , my dear bark-scraper , have you no feeling for clothes at all ? How can I put a thing like this in my pocket ?<stage>Handing it back to him</stage>I beg you to wrap it up . Here take this .<stage>Gives him a scarf</stage>Neatly , I pray you .<stage>Taking an orange ribbon out of his pocket</stage>Perhaps a little of this round it would make it more tolerable . You think so ? I leave it to you . I trust your taste entirely . . . . Leaving a loop for the little finger , I entreat you . . . so .<stage>He hangs it on his little finger</stage>In about five minutes , you said ? We will be there .<stage>With a bow</stage>We thank you .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>He departs delicately . The WOODCUTTER smiles to himself , puts down his axe and goes off to the PRINCESS . And just in time . For behold ! the KING and QUEEN return . At least we think it is the QUEEN , but she is so heavily disguised by a cloak which she wears over her court dress , that for a moment we are not quite sure .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>KING</speaker>
       <p>Now then , my love , if you will sit down on that log there —<stage>placing her</stage>— excellent — I think perhaps you should remove the crown .<stage>Removes it</stage>There ! Now the disguise is perfect .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>You 're sure they are coming ? It 's a very uncomfortable seat .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>KING</speaker>
       <p>I told them that the Princess was waiting for them here . Their natural disappointment at finding I was mistaken will make the test of their good nature an even more exacting one . My own impression is that the Yellow Prince will be the victor .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>Oh , I hate that man .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>KING</speaker>
       <p><stage>soothingly</stage>Well , well , perhaps it will be the Blue one .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>If anything , I dislike him more intensely .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>KING</speaker>
       <p>Or even the Red .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>Ugh ! I can n't bear him .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>KING</speaker>
       <p>Fortunately , dear , you are not called upon to marry any of them . It is for our darling that we are making the great decision . Listen ! I hear one coming . I will hide in the cottage and take note of what happens .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>He disappears into the cottage as the BLUE PRINCE comes in .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>Oh , sir , can you kindly spare a crust of bread for a poor old woman ! Please , pretty gentleman !</p>

       <p>Not too happy . Too weak . Help you eat .<stage>He breaks off a piece and holds it to her mouth . With a great effort the QUEEN disposes of it .</stage>Good ! . . . Again !<stage>She does it again .</stage>Now !<stage>She swallows another piece .</stage>Last piece !<stage>She takes it in . He pats her kindly on the back , and she nearly chokes .</stage>Good . . . . Better now ?</p>

       <p>The rest of the competition is of course more in the nature of a formality —</p>

       <p>Thank goodness .</p>
      </sp>

       <p>A crust of bread , madam ? Certainly . As luck will have it , I have a crust on me . My last one , but — your need is greater than mine . Eat , I pray .</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RED PRINCE</speaker>
       <p>No , I insist on your having it all . I am in the mood to be generous . Oblige me by eating it now for I am in a hurry ; yet I will not go until you have eaten .<stage>She does her best .</stage>You eat but slowly .<stage>Sternly</stage>Did you deceive me when you said you were hungry ?</p>

       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>
       <p>N-no . I 'm very hungry .<stage>She eats</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>RED PRINCE</speaker>
       <p>That 's better . Now understand — however poor I am , I can always find a crust of bread for an old woman . Always ! Remember this when next you are hungry . . . . You spoke ?<stage>She shakes her head and goes on eating .</stage>Finished ?</p>

      <stage>He goes out .</stage>
      <stage>The QUEEN rises in fury . The KING is about to come out of the cottage , when the YELLOW PRINCE enters . The QUEEN sits down again and mumbles something . It is certainly not an appeal for bread , but the YELLOW PRINCE is not to be denied .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>YELLOW PRINCE</speaker>
       <p><stage>gallantly</stage>My poor woman , you are in distress . It pains me to see it , madam , it pains me terribly . Can it be that you are hungry ? I thought so , I thought so .

      <sp>
       <speaker>YELLOW PRINCE</speaker>
       <p>Ah , madam , I see what it is . You do not wish to deprive me . You tell yourself , perchance , that it is not fitting that one in your station of life should partake of the meals of the highly born . You are not used , you say , to the food of Princes . Your rougher palate ——</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>QUEEN</speaker>

       <p>Bread , madam , the staff of life . Come , madam , will you not eat ?<stage>She tries desperately .</stage>What can be more delightful than a crust of bread by the wayside ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>The QUEEN shrieks and falls back in a swoon . The KING rushes out to her .</stage>

        <p>I said somebody had bagged my sponge , and she would n't like me to come down to prayers all unsponged , and she said , “ Excuses , Oliver , always excuses ! Leave me . I will see you later . ” Suppose that means I 've got to go to bed this afternoon . Jill , if I do , be sporty and bring me up “ Marooned in the Pacific . ”</p>

        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p>Oh , I know the one you mean . I must have put it down somewhere .<stage>He looks vaguely about the room .</stage></p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>GOVERNESS</speaker>
        <p>Perhaps you put it in your desk .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p>My desk ?</p>

       </sp>
       <stage>Under cover of this , OLIVER makes a great effort to get the book into JILL 'S desk , but it is no good .</stage>
       <sp>
        <speaker>GOVERNESS</speaker>
        <p><stage>brushing aside JILL and advancing on OLIVER</stage>Thank you , I will take it .</p>

        <p><stage>looking at the title</stage>Oh yes , this is the one .</p>

        <p><stage>gallantly</stage>I do n't care .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p>I did try to help you , Oliver .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p>You wait . Wo n't I jolly well bag something of hers one day , just when she wants it .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p>I 'm afraid you 'll find the afternoon rather tiring without your book . What will you do ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p>I suppose I shall have to think .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p>What shall you think about ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p>I shall think I 'm on my desert island .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p>Which desert island ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p>The one I always pretend I 'm on when I 'm thinking .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p>Is n't there any one else on it ever ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p>Oo , lots of pirates and Dyaks and cannibals and — other people .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p>What sort of other people ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p>I sha n't tell you . This is a special think I thought last night . As soon as I thought of it , I decided to keep it for<stage>impressively</stage>a moment of great emergency .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p><stage>silenced</stage>Oh ! . . . Oliver ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER Y</speaker>
        <p>es ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p>Let me be on your desert island this time . Because I did try to help you .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p>Well — well ——<stage>Generously</stage>Well , you can if you like .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p>Oh , thank you , Oliver . Wo n't you tell me what it 's about , and then we can both think it together this afternoon .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p>I expect you 'll think all sorts of silly things that never happen on a desert island .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p>I 'll try not to , Oliver , if you tell me .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p>All right .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p><stage>coming close to him</stage>Go on .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p>Well , you see , I 've been wrecked , you see , and the ship has foundered with all hands , you see , and I 've been cast ashore on a desert island , you see .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p>Have n't I been cast ashore too ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p>Well , you will be this afternoon , of course . Well , you see , we land on the island , you see , and it 's a perfectly ripping island , you see , and — and we land on it , you see , and . . . .</p>
       </sp>
       <stage>But we are getting on too fast . When the good ship crashed upon the rock and split in twain , it seemed like that all aboard must perish . Fortunately OLIVER was made of stern mettle . Hastily constructing a raft and placing the now unconscious JILL upon it , he launched it into the seething maelstrom of waters and pushed off . Tossed like a cockle-shell upon the mountainous waves , the tiny craft with its precious freight was in imminent danger of foundering . But OLIVER was made of stern mettle . With dauntless courage he rigged a jury-mast , and placed a telescope to his eye . “ Pull for the lagoon , JILL , ” cried the dauntless OLIVER , and in another moment . . . .</stage>
       <stage>As the raft glides into the still waters beyond the reef , we can see it more clearly . Can it be JILL 'S bed , with OLIVER in his pyjamas perched on the rail , and holding up his bath-towel ? Does he shorten sail for a moment to thump his chest and say , “ But OLIVER was made of stern mettle ” ? Or is it ——</stage>
       <stage>But the sun is sinking behind the swamp where the rattlesnakes bask . For a moment longer the sail gleams like copper in its rays , and then — fizz-z — we have lost it . See ! Is that speck on the inky black waters the dauntless Oliver ? It is . Let us follow to the island and see what adventures befall him .</stage>
      </div>
      <div type="scene" n="2">
       <head type="scene">SCENE II .— It is the island which we have dreamed about all our lives .</head>
       <stage type="setting">
        <stage>But at present we cannot see it properly , for it is dark . In one of those tropical darknesses which can be felt rather than seen OLIVER hands JILL out of the boat .</stage>
       </stage>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p>Tread carefully , Jill , there are lots of deadly rattlesnakes about .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p><stage>stepping hastily back into the boat</stage>Oli-ver !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p>You hear the noise of their rattles sometimes when the sun is sinking behind the swamp .<stage>The deadly rattle of the rattlesnake is heard</stage>There !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p>Oh , Oliver , are they very deadly ? Because if they are , I do n't think I shall like your island .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p>Those are n't . I always have their teeth taken out when ladies are coming . Besides , it 's daylight now .</p>
       </sp>
       <stage>With a rapidity common in the tropics — although it may just be OLIVER 'S gallantry — the sun climbs out of the sea , and floods the island , JILL , no longer frightened , steps out of the boat , and they walk up to the clearing in the middle .</stage>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p><stage>looking about her</stage>Oh , what a lovely island ! I think it 's lovely , Oliver .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p><stage>modestly</stage>It 's pretty decent , is n't it ? Wo n't you lie down ? I generally lie down here and watch the turtles coming out of the sea to deposit their eggs on the sand .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p><stage>lying down</stage>How many do they de-deposit usually , Oliver ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p>Oh , three — or a hundred . Just depends how hungry I am . Have a bull'shYpppHeNeye , wo n't you ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p><stage>excitedly</stage>Oh , did you bring some ?</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p><stage>annoyed</stage>Bring some ?<stage>Brightening up</stage>Oh , you mean from the wreck ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p><stage>hastily</stage>Yes , from the wreck . I mean besides the axe and the bag of nails and the gunpowder .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p>Could n't . The ship sank with all hands before I could get them . But it does n't matter , because<stage>going up to one of the trees</stage>I recognise this as the bull'shYpppHeNeye tree .<stage>He picks a couple of bull'shYpppHeNeyes and gives one to her .</stage></p>

        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p>Oh , Oliver , how lovely ! Thank you .<stage>She puts it in her mouth .</stage></p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p><stage>sucking hard</stage>There was nothing but breadfruit trees here the first time I was marooned on it . Rotten things to have on a decent island . So I planted a bull'shYpppHeNeye tree , and a barley-sugar-cane grove , and one or two other things , and made a jolly ripping place of it .</p>
       </sp>

        <p>I say , shut up , Jill . You did n't think I meant it for you , did you ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p>But there 's only you and me on the island .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p>What about the domestic animals ? I suppose they 've got to eat .</p>
       </sp>

        <p>Much better than that . Look in that cage there .</p>

        <p>Oh , is that a cage ? I never noticed it . What do I do ?</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p><stage>proudly</stage>I thought of that in bed one night . Spiffing idea , is n't it ? I 've got some other ones in the plantation over there . Awfully good specimens . I feed ‘ em on rice-pudding .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p>Can this one talk ?</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p><stage>still on her back with her eyes shut</stage>I had n't thought about it much , Oliver dear .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p>Because I can get you an awfully decent pirate , if you like , and if I was his brother-in-law it would be ripping . I 've often been marooned with him , of course , but never as his brother-in-law .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p>Why do n't you marry his daughter and be his son-in-law ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p>He has n't got a daughter .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p>Well , you could think him one .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p>I do n't want to . If ever I 'm such a silly ass as to marry , which I 'm jolly well not going to be , I shall marry a — a dusky maiden . Jill , be sporty . All girls have to get married some time . It 's different with men .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p>Very well , Oliver . I do n't want to spoil your afternoon .</p>

        <p>Glad to meet you , Commodore . I 'm — er — Two-toed Thomas , the Terror of the Dyaks . But you may call me Oliver , if you like . This is my sister Jill — the Pride of the Pampas .</p>

       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>PIRATE CHIEF</speaker>
        <p>Do n't mention it . A little discussion in the La Plata river with a Spanish gentleman . At the end of it I was an ear short and he was a head short . It was considered in the family that I had won .</p>
       </sp>
       <stage>There is an awkward pause .</stage>

       <sp>
        <speaker>PIRATE CHIEF</speaker>
        <p>Madam , I am not a marrying man , not to any extent , but if you would care to be Mrs. Crookshank , I 'd undertake on my part to have the deck swabbed every morning , and to put a polish on the four-pounder that you could see your pretty face in .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>

       <sp>
        <speaker>PIRATE</speaker>
        <p>Well , I never have had yet , but I have always been looking about for one .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p>Oh , Oliver , is n't Eric a nice man ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p><stage>casually</stage>I suppose the captain 's brother-in-law is generally the first man to board the Spaniard with his cutlass between his teeth ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>PIRATE</speaker>
        <p>You might almost say always . Many a ship on the Spanish Main I 've had to leave unboarded through want of a brother-in-law . They 're touchy about it somehow . Unless the captain 's brother-in-law comes first they get complaining .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p><stage>bashfully</stage>And there 's just one other thing . If the brigantine happened to put in at an island for water , and the captain 's brother-in-law happened — just happened — to be a silly ass and go and marry a dusky maiden , whom he met on the beach — -</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>PIRATE</speaker>
        <p>Bless you , it 's always happening to a captain 's brother-in-law .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p><stage>in a magnificent manner</stage>Then , Captain Crookshank , you may take my sister !</p>

        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p>Thank you , Oliver .</p>
       </sp>
       <stage>It is not every day that one-eared ERIC , that famous chieftain , marries into the family of the TERROR OF THE DYAKS . Naturally the occasion is celebrated by the whole pirate crew with a rousing chorus , followed by a dance in which the dusky maidens of the Island join . At the end of it , JILL finds herself alone with TUA-HEETA , the Dusky Princess .</stage>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p><stage>fashionably</stage>I 'm so pleased to meet my brother 's future wife . It 's so nice of you to come to see me . You will have some tea , wo n't you ?<stage>She puts out her hand and presses an imaginary bell</stage>I wanted to see you , because I can tell you so many little things about my brother , which I think you ought to know . You see , Eric — my husband —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>TUA-HEETA</speaker>
        <p>Ereec ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p>Yes . I wish you could see him . He 's so nice-looking . But I 'm afraid he wo n't be home to tea . That 's the worst of marrying a sailor . They are away so much . Well , I was telling you about Oliver . I think it would be better if you knew at once that — he does n't like rice-pudding .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>TUA-HEETA</speaker>
        <p>Rice-poodeeng ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p>Yes , he hates it . It is very important that you should remember that . Then there 's another thing —<stage>An untidy looking servant comes in . Can it be — can it possibly be AUNT JANE ? Horrors !</stage>He dislikes — Oh , there you are , Jane . You 've been a very long time answering the bell .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>AUNT JANE</speaker>
        <p>I 'm so sorry ma'am , I was just dressing .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p>Excuses , Jane , always excuses . Leave me . Take a week 's notice .<stage>To TUA-HEETA</stage>YOU must excuse my maid . She 's very stupid . Tea at once , Jane .<stage>AUNT JANE sniffs and goes off</stage>What was I saying ? Oh yes , about Oliver . He does n't care for cod-liver oil in the way that some men do . You would be wise not to force it on him just at first . . . . Have you any idea where you are going to live ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>TUA-HEETA</speaker>
        <p>Live ?<stage>These dusky maidens are no conversationalists .</stage></p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p>I expect Oliver will wish to reside at Hammersmith , so convenient for the City . You 'll like Hammersmith . You 'll go to St. Paul 's Church , I expect . The Vicar will be sure to call .<stage>Enter AUNT JANE with small tea-table .</stage>Ah , here 's tea .<stage>To JANE</stage>You 're very slow , Jane .</p>

        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p>It 's no good being sorry . Take another week 's notice .<stage>To TUA-HEETA</stage>You must forgive my talking to my maid . She wants such a lot of looking after .<stage>JANE puts down the table</stage>That will do , Jane ,<stage>JANE bumps against the table</stage>Dear , dear , how clumsy you are . What wages am I giving you now ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>

       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p>Well , we 'd better make it ninepence .<stage>JANE goes out in tears .</stage>Servants are a great nuisance , are n't they ? Jane is a peculiarly stupid person . She used to be aunt to my brother , and I have only taken her on out of charity .<stage>She pours out from an imaginary tea-pot</stage>Milk ? Sugar ?<stage>She puts them in and hands the imaginary cup to TUA-HEETA .</stage></p>
       </sp>

        <speaker>AUNT JANE</speaker>
        <p>Yes , ma'am .</p>
       </sp>
       <stage>She clears away the tea and TUA-HEETA and — very quickly — herself , as OLIVER comes back . OLIVER has been discussing boarding-tactics with his brother-in-law . CAPTAIN CROOKSHANK belongs to the now old-fashioned Marlinspike School ; OLIVER is for well-primed pistols .</stage>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p>Oh , Oliver , I love your island . I 've been thinking things all by myself . You 're married to Tua-heeta . You do n't mind , do you ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p>Not at all , Jill . Make yourself at home . I 've just been trying the doctor in the lagoon . There were sharks there , after all , so we 'll have to find another place for bathing . Oh , and I shot an elephant . What would you like to do now ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p>Just let 's lie here and see what happens .<stage>What happens is that a cassowary comes along .</stage>Oh , what a lovely bird ! Is it an ostrich ?</p>
       </sp>
       <stage>The cassowary sniffs the air , puts its beak to the ground and goes off again .</stage>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p>Silly ! It 's a cassowary , of course .</p>

        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p>What 's a cassowary ?</p>

        <lg>
         <l>Jill ! Do n't you remember the rhyme ?</l>
         <l>I wish I were a cassowary</l>
         <l>Upon the plains of Timbuctoo</l>
         <l>And then I 'd eat a missionary —</l>
         <l>And hat and gloves and hymn-book too !</l>
        </lg>
       </sp>
       <sp>

        <p>Is that all they 're for ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p>Well , what else would you want them for ?</p>
       </sp>
       <stage>A MISSIONARY , pith-helmet , gloves , hymn-book , umbrella , all complete — creeps cautiously up . He bears a strong likeness to the curate , the REVEREND SMILAX .</stage>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MISSIONARY</speaker>
        <p>I am sorry to intrude upon your privacy , dear friends , but have you observed a cassowary on this island , apparently looking for something ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p>Yes , we saw one just now .</p>

        <p><stage>shuddering</stage>Dear , dear , dear . You did n't happen to ask him what was the object of his researches ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>JILL</speaker>
        <p>He went so quickly .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>MISSIONARY</speaker>
        <p><stage>coming out of the undergrowth to them</stage>I wonder if you have ever heard of a little rhyme which apparently attributes to the bird in question , when residing in the level pastures of Timbuctoo , an unholy lust for the body and appurtenances thereto of an unnamed clerical gentleman ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p>and JILL<stage>shouting together</stage>Yes ! Rather !</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MISSIONARY</speaker>
        <p>Dear , dear ! Fortunately — I say fortunately — this is not Timbuctoo !<stage>OLIVER slips away and comes back with a notice-board “ Timbuctoo , ” which he places at the edge of the trees , unseen by the MISSIONARY , who goes on talking to JILL</stage>I take it that a cassowary residing in other latitudes is of a more temperate habit . His appetite , I venture to suggest , dear lady , would be under better restraint . That being so , I may perhaps safely ——<stage>He begins to move off , and comes suddenly up to the notice-board</stage>Dear , dear , dear , dear , dear ! This is terrible ! You said , I think , that the — ah — bird in question was moving in this direction ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
        <p>That 's right .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MISSIONARY</speaker>
        <p>Then I shall move , hastily yet with all due precaution , in that direction .<stage>He walks off on tiptoe , looking over his shoulder in case the cassowary should reappear . Consequently , he does not observe the enormous CANNIBAL who has appeared from the trees on the right , until he bumps into him</stage>I beg your ——<stage>He looks up</stage>Dear , dear , dear , dear , dear !</p>
       </sp>

        <speaker>CANNIBAL</speaker>
        <p>Boria , boria , boo !</p>

       </sp>
       <stage>While he is talking , the cassowary comes back , sidles up to him , and taps with his beak on the MISSIONARY 'S pith-helmet .</stage>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MISSIONARY</speaker>
        <p><stage>absently , without looking round</stage>Come in ! . . . As I was saying , my dear sir ——<stage>The bird taps again . The MISSIONARY turns round annoyed</stage>Ca n't you see I 'm engaged —— Oh dear , dear , dear , dear , dear !</p>
       </sp>
       <stage>He clasps the CANNIBAL in his anguish , recoils from the CANNIBAL and clasps the cassowary . The three of them go off together , OLIVER and JILL following eagerly behind to see who gets most .</stage>
       <stage>The PIRATES come back , each carrying a small wooden ammunition-box , and sit round in a semicircle , the PIRATE CHIEF in the middle .</stage>

Twenty-five years , man and boy , I have sailed the Spanish Main , and with the possible exception of a dumb and half-witted negro whom I shipped as cook in ‘ 64 , I have never met any one so profoundly lacking in intellect . I propose , therefore , that for the space of twenty-four hours the woman Pinniger should be incarcerated in the smuggler 's cave , in the company of a black beetle of friendly temperament .</p>

        <p>HUBBARD . Oh no , no , not at all , my love . . . After all , it is n't as if they were real children .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MRS</speaker>
        <p>HUBBARD<stage>indignantly</stage>Henry ! How can you say they are not real ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MR</speaker>
        <p>HUBBARD . Well , I mean they 're only the children we thought we 'd like to have if Father Christmas gave us any .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MRS</speaker>
        <p>HUBBARD . They are just as real to me as if they were here in the house . Ada , Bertram , Caroline , the high-spirited Dennis , pretty Elsie with the golden ringlets , dear little fair-haired Frank —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MR</speaker>
        <p>HUBBARD<stage>firmly</stage>Darling one , Frank has curly brown hair . It was an understood thing that you should choose the girls , and I should choose the boys . When we decided to take — A , B , C , D , E , F — a sixth child , it was my turn for a boy , and I selected Frank . He has curly brown hair and a fondness for animals .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MRS</speaker>
        <p>HUBBARD . I daresay you 're right , dear . Of course it is a little confusing when you never see your children .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MR</speaker>
        <p>HUBBARD . Well , well , perhaps some day Father Christmas will give us some .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MRS</speaker>
        <p>HUBBARD . Why does he neglect us so , Henry ? We hang up our stockings every year , but he never seems to notice them . Even a diamond necklace or a few oranges or a five-shilling postal order would be something .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MR</speaker>
        <p>HUBBARD . It is very strange . Possibly the fact that the chimney has not been swept for some years may have something to do with it . Or he may have forgotten our change of address . I cannot help feeling that if he knew how we had been left to starve in this way he would be very much annoyed .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MRS</speaker>
        <p>HUBBARD . And clothes . I have literally nothing but what I am standing up in — I mean sitting down in .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MR</speaker>
        <p>HUBBARD . Nor I , my love . But at least it will be written of us in the papers that the Hubbards perished in faultless evening dress . We are a proud race , and if Father Christmas deliberately cuts us off in this way , let us go down proudly . . . . Shall we go on reading or would you like to walk up and down the room ? Fortunately these simple pleasures are left to us .</p>

        <speaker>MR</speaker>
        <p>HUBBARD . Yes .<stage>Sadly , after a pause</stage>But we can n't go .</p>
       </sp>

        <p>HUBBARD<stage>sadly</stage>No , I have no clothes .</p>

        <speaker>MRS</speaker>
        <p>HUBBARD . How can I possibly go without a diamond necklace ? None of the Montmorency-Smythe women has ever been to Court without a diamond necklace .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MR</speaker>
        <p>HUBBARD . The Hubbards are a proud race . No male Hubbard would dream of appearing at Court without a gentleman 's gold Albert watch-chain . . . . Besides , there is another thing . There will be many footmen at Father Christmas 's Court , who will doubtless require coppers pressed into their palms . My honour would be seriously affected , were I compelled to whisper to them that I had no coppers .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MRS</speaker>
        <p>HUBBARD . It is very unfortunate . Father Christmas may have hundreds of presents waiting for us .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MR</speaker>
        <p>HUBBARD . True . But how would it be to hang up our stockings again this evening — now that we know he knows we are here ? I would suggest tied on to the door-knocker , to save him the trouble of coming down the chimney .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MRS</speaker>
        <p>HUBBARD<stage>excitedly</stage>Henry , I wonder ! But of course we will .</p>
       </sp>
       <stage>They begin to take off — the one a sock , the other a stocking .</stage>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MR</speaker>
        <p>HUBBARD . I almost wish now that my last suit had been a knickerbocker one . However , we must do what we can with a sock .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>JENNIFER LING</speaker>
        <p>Keep your breath for your song , Master Humphrey . That last “ Alleluia ” of yours was a poor windy thing , lacking grievously in substance .</p>

        <p>Ay , let 's begin , Peter Ableways , while we carry the tune in our heads . It is ill searching for the notes in the middle of the carol , as some singers do .</p>

        <p>Well spoken , Mistress Jennifer . Now listen all , while I unfold the nature of the entertainment .

        <p>Nay , not so fast , Master Peter . It would be ill if the good folk thought that our success this night were to be estimated by an empty hat . Place some of our money in it , Master Ableways . Where money is , money will come .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>MR</speaker>
        <p>HUBBARD . Thank you , dear . There 's just one little point . Father Christmas is sometimes rather shy about acknowledging the presents he gives . He hates being thanked . If , therefore , he makes any comment on your magnificent necklace or my handsome watch-chain , we must say that they have been in the family for some years .</p>

        <speaker>BLUEBEARD</speaker>
        <p>Beloved one , I will do anything for you .<stage>CRUSOE and GOLDILOCKS come back . Probably it will occur to the four of them to sing a song indicative of the happy family life awaiting them . On the other hand they may prefer to dance . . . .</stage>But enough of this . Let us get on to the great event of the evening . Ladies and gentlemen , are you all assembled ? Then silence , please , for FATHER CHRISTMAS .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>FATHER CHRISTMAS</speaker>
        <p>Ladies and gentlemen , it gives me great pleasure to see you here at my Court this evening ; and in particular my friends Mr. and Mrs. Hubbard , of whom I have been too long neglectful . However , I hope to make up for it to-night .<stage>To an USHER</stage>Disclose the Christmas Tree !</p>
       </sp>
       <stage>The Christmas Tree is disclosed , and — what do you think ? Children disguised as crackers are hanging from every branch ! Well , I never !</stage>
       <sp>
        <speaker>FATHER CHRISTMAS</speaker>
        <p><stage>quite calmly</stage>Distribute the presents !</p>
       </sp>
       <stage>An USHER takes down the children one by one and places them in a row , reading from the labels on them . “ MRS. HUBBARD , MR. HUBBARD ” alternately .</stage>

        <p>HUBBARD . There you are , darling , I told you he had curly brown hair . . . . Gwendoline !<stage>And so on .</stage></p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MRS</speaker>
        <p>HUBBARD<stage>to FATHER CHRISTMAS</stage>Oh thank you so much . It is sweet of you .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>MR</speaker>
        <p>HUBBARD<stage>to FATHER CHRISTMAS</stage>We are slightly overcome . Do you mind if we just dance it off .<stage>FATHER CHRISTMAS nods genially .</stage>Come on , children !</p>
       </sp>
       <stage>He holds out his hands , and he and his wife and the children dance round in a ring singing , “ Here we go round the Christmas Tree , all on a Christmas evening . . . . ”</stage>
       <stage>And then — But at this moment JAMES and ROSEMARY and the HUBBARD children stopped thinking , so of course the play came to an end . And if there were one or two bits in it which the children did n't quite understand , that was JAMES 'S fault . He never ought to have been thinking at all , really .</stage>

     <head>MR. PIM PASSES BY</head>
     <div type="act" n="1">
      <head type="act">ACT I</head>
      <stage>The morning-room at Marden House ( Buckinghamshire ) decided more than a hundred years ago that it was all right , and has not bothered about itself since . Visitors to the house have called the result such different adjectives as “ mellow ” “ old-fashioned , ” “ charming ” — even “ baronial ” and “ antique ” ; but nobody ever said it was “ exciting . ” Sometimes OLIVIA wants it to be more exciting , and last week she let herself go over some new curtains . At present they are folded up and waiting for her ; she still has the rings to put on . It is obvious that the curtains alone will overdo the excitement ; they will have to be harmonised with a new carpet and cushions . OLIVIA has her eye on just the things , but one has to go carefully with GEORGE . What was good enough for his great-great-grandfather is good enough for him . However , we can trust OLIVIA to see him through it , although it may take time .</stage>
      <stage>There are two ways of coming into the room ; by the open windows leading from the terrace or by the door . On this pleasant July morning MR. PIM chooses the latter way — or rather ANNE chooses it for him ; and old MR. PIM , wistful , kindly , gentle , little MR. PIM , living in some world of his own whither we cannot follow , ambles after her .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ANNE</speaker>
       <p>I 'll tell Mr. Marden you 're here , sir . Mr. Pim , is n't it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p><stage>coming back to this world</stage>Yes — er — Mr. Carraway Pim . He does n't know me , you understand , but if he could just see me for a moment — er —<stage>He fumbles in his pockets</stage>I gave you that letter ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ANNE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , sir , I 'll give it to him .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p><stage>bringing out a letter which is not the one he was looking for , but which reminds him of something else he has forgotten</stage>Dear me !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ANNE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , sir ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>I ought to have sent a telegram , but I can do it on my way back . You have a telegraph office in the village ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ANNE</speaker>
       <p>Oh yes , sir . If you turn to the left when you get outside the gates , it is n't more than a hundred yards down the hill .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>Thank you , thank you . Very stupid of me to have forgotten .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>ANNE goes out .</stage>
      <stage>MR. PIM wanders about the room humming to himself , and looking vaguely at the pictures . He has his back to the door as DINAH comes in . She is nineteen , very pretty , very happy , and full of boyish high spirits and conversation .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Hullo !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p><stage>turning round</stage>Ah , good morning , Mrs. Marden . You must forgive my — er —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Oh I say , I 'm not Mrs. Marden . I 'm Dinah .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p><stage>with a bow</stage>Then I will say , Good morning , Miss Diana .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p><stage>reproachfully</stage>Now , look here , if you and I are going to be friends you must n't do that . Dinah , not Diana . Do remember it , there 's a good man , because I get so tired of correcting people . Have you come to stay with us ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>Well no , Miss — er — Dinah .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p><stage>nodding</stage>That 's right . I can see I sha n't have to speak to you again . Now tell me your name , and I bet you I get it right first time . And do sit down .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p><stage>sitting down</stage>Thank you . My name is — er — Pim , Carraway Pim —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Pim , that 's easy .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>And I have a letter of introduction to your father —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Oh no ; now you 're going wrong again , Mr. Pim . George is n't my father ; he 's my uncle . Uncle George — he does n't like me calling him George . Olivia does n't mind — I mean she does n't mind being called Olivia , but George is rather touchy . You see , he 's been my guardian since I was about two , and then about five years ago he married a widow called Mrs. Telworthy — that 's Olivia — so she became my Aunt Olivia , only she lets me drop the Aunt . Got that ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p><stage>a little alarmed</stage>I — I think so , Miss Marden .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p><stage>admiringly</stage>I say , you are quick , Mr. Pim . Well , if you take my advice , when you 've finished your business with George , you will hang about a bit and see if you can n't see Olivia . She 's simply devastating . I do n't wonder George fell in love with her .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>It 's only the merest matter of business — just a few minutes with your uncle — I 'm afraid I shall hardly —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Well , you must please yourself , Mr. Pim . I 'm just giving you a friendly word of advice . Naturally , I was awfully glad to get such a magnificent aunt , because , of course , marriage is rather a toss up , is n't it , and George might have gone off with anybody . It 's different on the stage , where guardians always marry their wards , but George could n't marry me because I 'm his niece . Mind you , I do n't say that I should have had him , because between ourselves he 's a little bit old-fashioned .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>So he married — er — Mrs. Marden instead .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Mrs. Telworthy — do n't say you 've forgotten already , just when you were getting so good at names . Mrs. Telworthy . You see , Olivia married the Telworthy man and went to Australia with him , and he drank himself to death in the bush , or wherever you drink yourself to death out there , and Olivia came home to England , and met my uncle , and he fell in love with her and proposed to her , and he came into my room that night — I was about fourteen — and turned on the light and said , “ Dinah , how would you like to have a beautiful aunt of your very own ? ” And I said : “ Congratulations , George . ” That was the first time I called him George . Of course , I 'd seen it coming for weeks . Telworthy , is n't it a funny name ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>Very singular . From Australia , you say ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Yes , I always say that he 's probably still alive , and will turn up here one morning and annoy George , because that 's what first husbands always do in books , but I 'm afraid there 's not much chance .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p><stage>shocked</stage>Miss Marden !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Well , of course , I do n't really want it to happen , but it would be rather exciting , would n't it ? However , things like that never seem to occur down here , somehow . There was a hay-rick burnt last year about a mile away , but that is n't quite the same thing , is it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>No , I should say that that was certainly different .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Of course , something very , very wonderful did happen last night , but I 'm not sure if I know you well enough ——<stage>She looks at him hesitatingly .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p><stage>uncomfortably</stage>Really , Miss Marden , I am only a — a passer-by , here to-day and gone to-morrow . You really must n't ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>And yet there 's something about you , Mr. Pim , which inspires confidence . The fact is —<stage>in a stage whisper</stage>— I got engaged last night !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>Dear me , let me congratulate you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>I expect that 's why George is keeping you such a long time . Brian , my young man , the well-known painter — only nobody has ever heard of him — he 's smoking a pipe with George in the library and asking for his niece 's hand . Is n't it exciting ? You 're really rather lucky , Mr. Pim — I mean being told so soon . Even Olivia does n't know yet .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p><stage>getting up</stage>Yes , yes . I congratulate you , Miss Marden . Perhaps it would be better ——</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>ANNE comes in .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ANNE</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Mr. Marden is out at the moment , sir —— Oh , I did n't see you ,</l>
        <l>Miss Dinah .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>It 's all right , Anne . I 'm looking after Mr. Pim .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ANNE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , Miss .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>She goes out .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p><stage>excitedly</stage>That 's me . They can n't discuss me in the library without breaking down , so they 're walking up and down outside , and slashing at the thistles in order to conceal their emotion . You know . I expect Brian ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking at his watch</stage>Yes , I think , Miss Marden , I had better go now and return a little later . I have a telegram which I want to send , and perhaps by the time I came back ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Oh , but how disappointing of you , when we were getting on together so nicely . And it was just going to be your turn to tell me all about yourself .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>I have really nothing to tell , Miss Marden . I have a letter of introduction to Mr. Marden , who in turn will give me , I hope , a letter to a certain distinguished man whom it is necessary for me to meet . That is all .<stage>Holding out his hand</stage>And now , Miss Marden ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Oh , I 'll start you on your way to the post office . I want to know if you 're married , and all that sort of thing . You 've got heaps to tell me , Mr. Pim . Have you got your hat ? That 's right . Then we 'll — hullo , here 's Brian .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>BRIAN STRANGE comes in at the windows . He is what GEORGE calls a damned futuristic painter-chap , aged twenty-four . To look at , he is a very pleasant boy , rather untidily dressed .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p><stage>nodding</stage>How do you do ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p><stage>seizing him</stage>Brian , this is Mr. Pim . Mr. Carraway Pim . He 's been telling me all about himself . It 's so interesting . He 's just going to send a telegram , and then he 's coming back again . Mr. Pim , this is Brian — you know .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p><stage>smiling and shaking hands</stage>How do you do ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p><stage>pleadingly</stage>You wo n't mind going to the post office by yourself , will you , because , you see , Brian and I —<stage>she looks lovingly at BRIAN</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p><stage>because they are so young</stage>Miss Dinah and Mr .— er — Brian , I have only come into your lives for a moment , and it is probable that I shall now pass out of them for ever , but you will allow an old man ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Oh , not old !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p><stage>chuckling happily</stage>Well , a middle-aged man — to wish you both every happiness in the years that you have before you . Good-bye , good-bye .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>He disappears gently through the windows .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Brian , he 'll get lost if he goes that way .</p>
      </sp>

       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Darling , you have n't kissed me yet .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p><stage>taking her in his arms</stage>I ought n't to , but then one never ought to do the nice things .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Why ought n't you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>They sit on the sofa together .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>Well , we said we 'd be good until we 'd told your uncle and aunt all about it . You see , being a guest in their house ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>But , darling child , what have you been doing all this morning except telling George ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>Trying to tell George .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p><stage>nodding</stage>Yes , of course , there 's a difference .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>I think he guessed there was something up , and he took me down to see the pigs — he said he had to see the pigs at once — I do n't know why ; an appointment perhaps . And we talked about pigs all the way , and I could n't say , “ Talking about pigs , I want to marry your niece —— ”</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p><stage>with mock indignation</stage>Of course you could n't .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>No . Well , you see how it was . And then when we 'd finished talking about pigs , we started talking to the pigs ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p><stage>eagerly</stage>Oh , how is Arnold ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>The little black-and-white one ? He 's very jolly , I believe , but naturally I was n't thinking about him much . I was wondering how to begin . And then Lumsden came up , and wanted to talk pig-food , and the atmosphere grew less and less romantic , and — and I gradually drifted away .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Poor darling . Well , we shall have to approach him through</l>
        <l>Olivia .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>But I always wanted to tell her first ; she 's so much easier . Only you would n't let me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>That 's your fault , Brian . You would tell Olivia that she ought to have orange-and-black curtains .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>But she wants orange-and-black curtains .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Yes , but George says he 's not going to have any futuristic nonsense in an honest English country house , which has been good enough for his father and his grandfather and his great-grandfather , and — and all the rest of them . So there 's a sort of strained feeling between Olivia and George just now , and if Olivia were to — sort of recommend you , well , it would n't do you much good .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking at her</stage>I see . Of course I know what you want , Dinah .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>What do I want ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>You want a secret engagement , and notes left under door-mats , and meetings by the withered thorn , when all the household is asleep . I know you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Oh , but it is such fun ! I love meeting people by withered thorns .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>Well , I 'm not going to have it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p><stage>childishly</stage>Oh , George ! Look at us being husbandy !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>You babe ! I adore you .<stage>He kisses her and holds her away from him and looks at her</stage>You know , you 're rather throwing yourself away on me . Do you mind ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Not a bit .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>We shall never be rich , but we shall have lots of fun , and meet interesting people , and feel that we 're doing something worth doing , and not getting paid nearly enough for it , and we can curse the Academy together and the British Public , and — oh , it 's an exciting life .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p><stage>seeing it</stage>I shall love it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>I 'll make you love it . You sha n't be sorry , Dinah .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>You sha n't be sorry either , Brian .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking at her lovingly</stage>Oh , I know I sha n't . . . . What will Olivia think about it ? Will she be surprised ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>She 's never surprised . She always seems to have thought of things about a week before they happen . George just begins to get hold of them about a week after they 've happened .<stage>Considering him</stage>After all , there 's no reason why George should n't like you , darling .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>I 'm not his sort , you know .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>You 're more Olivia 's sort . Well , we 'll tell Olivia this morning .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>coming in</stage>And what are you going to tell Olivia this morning ?<stage>She looks at them with a smile</stage>Oh , well , I think I can guess .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>Shall we describe OLIVIA ? But you will know all about her before the day is over .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p><stage>jumping up</stage>Olivia , darling !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p><stage>following</stage>Say you understand , Mrs. Marden .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Mrs. Marden , I am afraid , is a very dense person , Brian , but I think if you asked Olivia if she understood ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>Bless you , Olivia . I knew you 'd be on our side .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Of course she would .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>I do n't know if it 's usual to kiss an aunt-in-law , Brian , but Dinah is such a very special sort of niece that —<stage>she inclines her cheek and BRIAN kisses it</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>I say , you are in luck to-day , Brian .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>going over to her chair by the work-table and getting to business with the curtains</stage>And how many people have been told the good news ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>Nobody yet .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Except Mr. Pim .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>Oh , does he —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Who 's Mr. Pim ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Oh , he just happened — I say , are those the curtains ? Then you 're going to have them after all ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>with an air of surprise</stage>After all what ? But I decided on them long ago .<stage>to BRIAN</stage>You have n't told George yet ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>I began to , you know , but I never got any farther than</l>
        <l>“ Er — there 's just — er — ”</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>George would talk about pigs all the time .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Well , I suppose you want me to help you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Do , darling .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>It would be awfully decent of you . Of course , I 'm not quite his sort really —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>You 're my sort .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>But I do n't think he objects to me , and —</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>GEORGE comes in , a typical , narrow-minded , honest country gentleman of forty odd .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>at the windows</stage>What 's all this about a Mr. Pim ?<stage>He kicks some of the mud off his boots</stage>Who is he ? Where is he ? I had most important business with Lumsden , and the girl comes down and cackles about a Mr. Pim , or Ping , or something . Where did I put his card ?<stage>Bringing it out</stage>Carraway Pim . Never heard of him in my life .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>He said he had a letter of introduction , Uncle George .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , you saw him , did you ? Yes , that reminds me , there was a letter —<stage>he brings it out and reads it</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>He had to send a telegram . He 's coming back .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Pass me those scissors , Brian .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>These ?<stage>He picks them up and comes close to her .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Thank you .<stage>She indicates GEORGE 'S back . “ Now ? ” says BRIAN with his eyebrows . She nods .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>reading</stage>Ah well , a friend of Brymer 's . Glad to oblige him . Yes , I know the man he wants . Coming back , you say , Dinah ? Then I 'll be going back . Send him down to the farm , Olivia , when he comes .<stage>to BRIAN</stage>Hallo , what happened to you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Do n't go , George , there 's something we want to talk about .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Hallo , what 's this ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p><stage>to OLIVIA</stage>Shall I ——?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p><stage>stepping out</stage>I 've been wanting to tell you all this morning , sir , only I did n't seem to have an opportunity of getting it out .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Well , what is it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>I want to marry Dinah , sir .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>You want to marry Dinah ? God bless my soul !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p><stage>rushing to him and putting her cheek against his coat</stage>Oh , do say you like the idea , Uncle George .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Like the idea ! Have you heard of this nonsense , Olivia ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>They 've just this moment told me , George . I think they would be happy together .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>to BRIAN</stage>And what do you propose to be happy together on ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>Well , of course , it does n't amount to much at present , but we sha n't starve .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Brian got fifty pounds for a picture last March !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>a little upset by this</stage>Oh !<stage>Recovering gamely</stage>And how many pictures have you sold since ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>Well , none , but —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>None ! And I do n't wonder . Who the devil is going to buy pictures with triangular clouds and square sheep ? And they call that Art nowadays ! Good God , man ,<stage>waving him to the windows</stage>go outside and look at the clouds !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>If he draws round clouds in future , George , will you let him marry Dinah ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>What — what ? Yes , of course , you would be on his side — all this Futuristic nonsense . I 'm just taking these clouds as an example . I suppose I can see as well as any man in the county , and I say that clouds are n't triangular .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>After all , sir , at my age one is naturally experimenting , and trying to find one 's<stage>with a laugh</stage>— well , it sounds priggish , but one 's medium of expression . I shall find out what I want to do directly , but I think I shall always be able to earn enough to live on . Well , I have for the last three years .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>I see , and now you want to experiment with a wife , and you propose to start experimenting with my niece ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p><stage>with a shrug</stage>Well , of course , if you —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>You could help the experiment , darling , by giving Dinah a good allowance until she 's twenty-one .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Help the experiment ! I do n't want to help the experiment .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>apologetically</stage>Oh , I thought you did .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>You will talk as if I was made of money . What with taxes always going up and rents always going down , it 's as much as we can do to rub along as we are , without making allowances to everybody who thinks she wants to get married .<stage>to BRIAN</stage>And that 's thanks to you , my friend .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p><stage>surprised</stage>To me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>You never told me , darling . What 's Brian been doing ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p><stage>indignantly</stage>He has n't been doing anything .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>He 's one of your Socialists who go turning the country upside down .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>But even Socialists must get married sometimes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>I do n't see any necessity .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>But you 'd have nobody to damn after dinner , darling , if they all died out .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>Really , sir , I do n't see what my politics and my art have got to do with it . I 'm perfectly ready not to talk about either when I 'm in your house , and as Dinah does n't seem to object to them —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>I should think she does n't .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , you can get round the women , I daresay .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>Well , it 's Dinah I want to marry and live with . So what it really comes to is that you do n't think I can support a wife .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Well , if you 're going to do it by selling pictures , I do n't think you can .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>All right , tell me how much you want me to earn in a year , and</l>
        <l>I 'll earn it .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>hedging</stage>It is n't merely a question of money . I just mention that as one thing — one of the important things . In addition to that , I think you are both too young to marry . I do n't think you know your own minds , and I am not at all persuaded that , with what I venture to call your outrageous tastes , you and my niece will live happily together . Just because she thinks she loves you , Dinah may persuade herself now that she agrees with all you say and do , but she has been properly brought up in an honest English country household , and — er — she — well , in short , I cannot at all approve of any engagement between you .<stage>Getting up</stage>Olivia , if this Mr .— er — Pim comes , I shall be down at the farm . You might send him along to me .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>He walks towards the windows .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p><stage>indignantly</stage>Is there any reason why I should n't marry a girl who has been properly brought up ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>I think you know my views , Strange .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>George , wait a moment , dear . We can n't quite leave it like this .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>I have said all I want to say on the subject .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Yes , darling , but I have n't begun to say all that I want to say on the subject .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Of course , if you have anything to say , Olivia , I will listen to it ; but I do n't know that this is quite the time , or that you have chosen —<stage>looking darkly at the curtains</stage>— quite the occupation likely to — er — endear your views to me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p><stage>mutinously</stage>I may as well tell you , Uncle George , that I have got a good deal to say , too .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>I can guess what you are going to say , Dinah , and I think you had better keep it for the moment .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p><stage>meekly</stage>Yes , Aunt Olivia .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Brian , you might take her outside for a walk . I expect you have plenty to talk about .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Now mind , Strange , no love-making . I put you on your honour about that .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>I 'll do my best to avoid it , sir .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p><stage>cheekily</stage>May I take his arm if we go up a hill ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>I 'm sure you 'll know how to behave — both of you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>Come on , then , Dinah .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Righto .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>as they go</stage>And if you do see any clouds , Strange , take a good look at them .<stage>He chuckles to himself</stage>Triangular clouds — I never heard of such nonsense .<stage>He goes back to his chair at the writing-table</stage>Futuristic rubbish . . . . Well , Olivia ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Well , George ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>What are you doing ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Making curtains , George . Wo n't they be rather sweet ? Oh , but I forgot — you do n't like them .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>I do n't like them , and what is more , I do n't mean to have them in my house . As I told you yesterday , this is the house of a simple country gentleman , and I do n't want any of these new-fangled ideas in it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Is marrying for love a new-fangled idea ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>We 'll come to that directly . None of you women can keep to the point . What I am saying now is that the house of my fathers and forefathers is good enough for me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Do you know , George , I can hear one of your ancestors saying that to his wife in their smelly old cave , when the new-fangled idea of building houses was first suggested . “ The Cave of my Fathers is — ”</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>That 's ridiculous . Naturally we must have progress . But that 's just the point .<stage>Indicating the curtains</stage>I do n't call this sort of thing progress . It 's — ah — retrogression .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Well , anyhow , it 's pretty .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>There I disagree with you . And I must say once more that I will not have them hanging in my house .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Very well , George .<stage>But she goes on working .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>That being so , I do n't see the necessity of going on with them .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Well , I must do something with them now I 've got the material . I thought perhaps I could sell them when they 're finished — as we 're so poor .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>What do you mean — so poor ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Well , you said just now that you could n't give Dinah an allowance because rents had gone down .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>annoyed</stage>Confound it , Olivia ! Keep to the point ! We 'll talk about Dinah 's affairs directly . We 're discussing our own affairs at the moment .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>But what is there to discuss ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Those ridiculous things .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>But we 've finished that . You 've said you would n't have them hanging in your house , and I 've said , “ Very well , George . ” Now we can go on to Dinah and Brian .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>shouting</stage>But put these beastly things away .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>rising and gathering up the curtains</stage>Very well , George .<stage>She puts them away , slowly , gracefully . There is an uncomfortable silence . Evidently somebody ought to apologise .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>realising that he is the one</stage>Er — look here , Olivia , old girl , you 've been a jolly good wife to me , and we do n't often have rows , and if I 've been rude to you about this — lost my temper a bit perhaps , what ?— I 'll say I 'm sorry . May I have a kiss ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>holding up her face</stage>George , darling !<stage>He kisses her .</stage>Do you love me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>You know I do , old girl .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>As much as Brian loves Dinah ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>stiffly</stage>I 've said all I want to say about that .<stage>He goes away from her .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , but there must be lots you want to say — and perhaps do n't like to . Do tell me , darling .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>What it comes to is this . I consider that Dinah is too young to choose a husband for herself , and that Strange is n't the husband I should choose for her .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>You were calling him Brian yesterday .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Yesterday I regarded him as a boy , now he wants me to look upon him as a man .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>He 's twenty-four .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>And Dinah 's nineteen . Ridiculous !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>If he 'd been a Conservative , and thought that clouds were round , I suppose he 'd have seemed older , somehow .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>That 's a different point altogether . That has nothing to do with his age .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>innocently</stage>Oh , I thought it had .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>What I am objecting to is these ridiculously early marriages before either party knows its own mind , much less the mind of the other party . Such marriages invariably lead to unhappiness .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Of course , my first marriage was n't a happy one .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>As you know , Olivia , I dislike speaking about your first marriage at all , and I had no intention of bringing it up now , but since you mention it — well , that is a case in point .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking back at it</stage>When I was eighteen , I was in love . Or perhaps I only thought I was , and I do n't know if I should have been happy or not if I had married him . But my father made me marry a man called Jacob Telworthy ; and when things were too hot for him in England — “ too hot for him ” — I think that was the expression we used in those days — then we went to Australia , and I left him there , and the only happy moment I had in all my married life was on the morning when I saw in the papers that he was dead .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>very uncomfortable</stage>Yes , yes , my dear , I know . You must have had a terrible time . I can hardly bear to think about it . My only hope is that I have made up to you for it in some degree . But I do n't see what bearing it has upon Dinah 's case .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , none , except that my father liked Jacob 's political opinions and his views on art . I expect that that was why he chose him for me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>You seem to think that I wish to choose a husband for Dinah . I do n't at all . Let her choose whom she likes as long as he can support her and there 's a chance of their being happy together . Now , with regard to this fellow —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>You mean Brian ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>He 's got no money , and he 's been brought up in quite a different way from Dinah . Dinah may be prepared to believe that — er — all cows are blue , and that — er — waves are square , but she wo n't go on believing it for ever .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Neither will Brian .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Well , that 's what I keep telling him , only he wo n't see it . Just as I keep telling you about those ridiculous curtains . It seems to me that I am the only person in the house with any eyesight left .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Perhaps you are , darling ; but you must let us find out our own mistakes for ourselves . At any rate , Brian is a gentleman ; he loves Dinah , Dinah loves him ; he 's earning enough to support himself , and you are earning enough to support Dinah . I think it 's worth risking , George .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>stiffly</stage>I can only say the whole question demands much more anxious thought than you seem to have given it . You say that he is a gentleman . He knows how to behave , I admit ; but if his morals are as topsy-turvy as his tastes and — er — politics , as I 've no doubt they are , then — er — In short , I do not approve of Brian Strange as a husband for my niece and ward .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking at him thoughtfully</stage>You are a curious mixture , George . You were so very unconventional when you married me , and you 're so very conventional when Brian wants to marry Dinah . . . . George Marden to marry the widow of a convict !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Convict ! What do you mean ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Jacob Telworthy , convict — I forget his number — surely I told you all this , dear , when we got engaged ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Never !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>I told you how he carelessly put the wrong signature to a cheque for a thousand pounds in England ; how he made a little mistake about two or three companies he 'd promoted in Australia ; and how —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , yes , but you never told me he was convicted !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>What difference does it make ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>My dear Olivia , if you can n't see that — a convict !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>So , you see , we need n't be too particular about our niece , need we ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>I think we had better leave your first husband out of the conversation altogether . I never wished to refer to him ; I never wish to hear about him again . I certainly had not realised that he was actually — er — convicted for his — er —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Mistakes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Well , we need n't go into that . As for this other matter , I do n't for a moment take it seriously . Dinah is an exceptionally pretty girl , and young Strange is a good-looking boy . If they are attracted to each other , it is a mere outward attraction which I am convinced will not lead to any lasting happiness . That must be regarded as my last word in the matter , Olivia . If this Mr .— er — what was his name , comes , I shall be down at the farm .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>He goes out by the door .</stage>
      <stage>Left alone , OLIVIA brings out her curtains again , and gets calmly to work upon them .</stage>
      <stage>DINAH and BRIAN come in by the windows .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Finished ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Oh no , I 've got all these rings to put on .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>I meant talking to George .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>We walked about outside —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Until we heard him not talking to you any more —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>And we did n't kiss each other once .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Brian was very George-like . He would n't even let me tickle the back of his neck .<stage>She goes up suddenly to OLIVIA and kneels by her and kisses her</stage>Darling , being George-like is a very nice thing to be — I mean a nice thing for other people to be — I mean — oh , you know what I mean . But say that he 's going to be decent about it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Of course he is , Dinah .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>You mean he 'll let me come here as — as —</p>

       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>As my young man ?</p>

       <p>Oh , I think so .</p>
      </sp>

       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Olivia , you 're a wonder . Have you really talked him round ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>I have n't said anything yet . But I daresay I shall think of something .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Oh , you simply must , Mr. Pim . You have n't told us half enough about yourself yet . I want to hear all about your early life .</p>

       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>It 's very kind of you to ask me , Mrs. Marden , but I am lunching with the Trevors .</p>

       <p>The reason why we like Mr. Pim so much is that he was the first person to congratulate us . We feel that he is going to have a great influence on our lives .</p>

       <p>Oh , not at all , Mrs. Marden .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Of course you wo n't say anything about their engagement . We only heard about it five minutes ago , and nothing has been settled yet .</p>

       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Not at all . Very glad to meet you now . Any friend of Brymer 's . You want a letter to this man Fanshawe ?</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Oh yes . You 've been in Australia , Mr. Pim ?</p>

       <p>Oh , that 's all right , thank you .<stage>to OLIVIA</stage>Oh yes , I have been in Australia more than once in the last few years .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Really ? I used to live at Sydney many years ago . Do you know</l>
        <l>Sydney at all ?</l>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>Thank you , thank you .<stage>to OLIVIA</stage>Indeed yes , I spent several months in Sydney .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>How curious . I wonder if we have any friends in common there .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>hastily</stage>Extremely unlikely , I should think . Sydney is a very big place .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>True , but the world is a very small place , Mr. Marden . I had a remarkable instance of that , coming over on the boat this last time .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Ah !<stage>Feeling that the conversation is now safe , he resumes his letter .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>Yes . There was a man I used to employ in Sydney some years ago , a bad fellow , I 'm afraid , Mrs. Marden , who had been in prison for some kind of fraudulent company-promoting and had taken to drink and — and so on .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Yes , yes , I understand .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>Drinking himself to death I should have said . I gave him at the most another year to live . Yet to my amazement the first person I saw as I stepped on board the boat that brought me to England last week was this fellow . There was no mistaking him . I spoke to him , in fact ; we recognised each other .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Really ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>He was travelling steerage ; we did n't meet again on board , and as it happened at Marseilles , this poor fellow — er — now what was his name ? A very unusual one . Began with a — a T , I think .</p>

      <stage>Lunch is over and coffee has been served on the terrace . Conversation drags on , to the satisfaction of LADY MARDEN , but of nobody else . GEORGE and OLIVIA want to be alone ; so do BRIAN and DINAH . At last BRIAN murmurs something about a cigarette-case ; and , catching DINAH 'S eye , comes into the house . He leans against the sofa and waits for DINAH .</stage>

       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p><stage>in her ordinary voice</stage>That was just for their benefit . I said I 'd help you find it . It is your cigarette-case we 're looking for , is n't it ?</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>No , thank you , darling . Aunt Juli-ah still thinks it 's unladylike . . . . Have you ever seen her beagling ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>No . Is that very ladylike ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Very . . . . I say , what has happened , do you think ?</p>

       <p>Everything . I love you , and you love me .</p>

       <p>Silly ! I meant between George and Olivia . Did n't you notice them at lunch ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>I noticed that you seemed to be doing most of the talking . But then I 've noticed that before sometimes . Do you think Olivia and your uncle have quarrelled because of us ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Of course not . George may think he has quarrelled , but I 'm quite sure Olivia has n't . No , I believe Mr. Pim 's at the bottom of it . He 's brought some terribly sad news about George 's investments . The old home will have to be sold up .</p>
      </sp>

       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>Good . Then your uncle wo n't mind your marrying me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Yes , darling , but you must be more dramatic about it than that . “ George , ” you must say , with tears in your eyes , “ I cannot pay off the whole of the mortgage for you . I have only two and ninepence ; but at least let me take your niece off your hands . ” Then George will thump you on the back and say gruffly , “ You 're a good fellow , Brian , a damn good fellow , ” and he 'll blow his nose very loudly , and say , “ Confound this cigar , it wo n't draw properly . ”<stage>She gives us a rough impression of GEORGE doing it .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>Dinah , you 're a heavenly idiot . And you 've simply got to marry me , uncles or no uncles .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>It will have to be “ uncles , ” I 'm afraid , because , you see , I 'm his ward , and I can get sent to Chancery or Coventry or somewhere beastly , if I marry without his consent . Have n't you got anybody who objects to your marrying me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>Nobody , thank Heaven .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Well , that 's rather disappointing of you . I saw myself fascinating your aged father at the same time that you were fascinating George . I should have done it much better than you . As a George-fascinator you are n't very successful , sweetheart .</p>
      </sp>

      </sp>
      <stage>She strides out , followed by DINAH and BRIAN .</stage>
      <stage>GEORGE sits down at his desk with his head in his hand , and stabs the blotting-paper with a pen . OLIVIA takes the curtains with her to the sofa and begins to work on them .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking up and seeing them</stage>Really , Olivia , we 've got something more important , more vital to us than curtains , to discuss , now that we are alone at last .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>I was n't going to discuss them , dear .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>I 'm always glad to see Aunt Julia in my house , but I wish she had n't chosen this day of all days to come to lunch .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>It was n't Aunt Julia 's fault . It was really Mr. Pim who chose the wrong day .</p>

       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>About Jacob Telworthy ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>You told me he was dead . You always said that he was dead . You — you —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Well , I always thought that he was dead . He was as dead as anybody could be . All the papers said he was dead .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>scornfully</stage>The papers !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>as if this would settle it for GEORGE</stage>The Times said he was dead . There was a paragraph about him . Apparently even his death was fraudulent .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , yes , I 'm not blaming you , Olivia , but what are we going to do , that 's the question , what are we going to do ? My God , it 's horrible ! You 've never been married to me at all ! You do n't seem to understand .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>It is a little difficult to realise . You see , it does n't seem to have made any difference to our happiness .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>No , that 's what 's so terrible . I mean — well , of course , we were quite innocent in the matter . But , at the same time , nothing can get over the fact that we — we had no right to — to be happy .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Would you rather we had been miserable ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>You 're Telworthy 's wife , that 's what you do n't seem to understand . You 're Telworthy 's wife . You — er — forgive me , Olivia , but it 's the horrible truth — you committed bigamy when you married me .<stage>In horror</stage>Bigamy !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>It is an ugly word , is n't it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , but do n't you understand —<stage>He jumps up and comes over to her</stage>Look here , Olivia , old girl , the whole thing is nonsense , eh ? It is n't your husband , it 's some other Telworthy that this fellow met . That 's right , is n't it ? Some other shady swindler who turned up on the boat , eh ? This sort of thing does n't happen to people like us — committing bigamy and all that . Some other fellow .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>shaking her head</stage>I knew all the shady swindlers in Sydney , George . . . . They came to dinner . . . . There were no others called Telworthy .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>GEORGE goes back despondently to his seat .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Well , what are we going to do ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>You sent Mr. Pim away so quickly . He might have told us things . Telworthy 's plans . Where he is now . You hurried him away so quickly .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>I 've sent a note round to ask him to come back . My one idea at the moment was to get him out of the house — to hush things up .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>You can n't hush up two husbands .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>in despair</stage>You can n't . Everybody will know . Everybody !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>The children , Aunt Julia , they may as well know now as later . Mr. Pim must , of course .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>I do not propose to discuss my private affairs with Mr. Pim ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>But he 's mixed himself up in them rather , has n't he , and if you 're going to ask him questions ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>I only propose to ask him one question . I shall ask him if he is absolutely certain of the man 's name . I can do that quite easily without letting him know the reason for my inquiry .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>You could n't make a mistake about a name like Telworthy . But he might tell us something about Telworthy 's plans . Perhaps he 's going back to Australia at once . Perhaps he thinks I 'm dead , too . Perhaps — oh , there are so many things I want to know .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , yes , dear . It would be interesting to — that is , one naturally wants to know these things , but of course it does n't make any real difference .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>surprised</stage>No difference ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Well , that is to say , you 're as much his wife if he 's in</l>
        <l>Australia as you are if he 's in England .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>I am not his wife at all .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>But , Olivia , surely you understand the position ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>shaking her head</stage>Jacob Telworthy may be alive , but I am not his wife . I ceased to be his wife when I became yours .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>You never were my wife . That is the terrible part of it . Our union — you make me say it , Olivia — has been unhallowed by the Church . Unhallowed even by the Law . Legally , we have been living in — living in — well , the point is , how does the Law stand ? I imagine that Telworthy could get a — a divorce . . . . Oh , it seems impossible that things like this can be happening to us .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>Joyfully</stage>A divorce ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>I — I imagine so .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>But then we could really get married , and we should n't be living in — living in — whatever we were living in before .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>I can n't understand you , Olivia . You talk about it so calmly , as if there was nothing blameworthy in being divorced , as if there was nothing unusual in my marrying a divorced woman , as if there was nothing wrong in our having lived together for years without having been married .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>What seems wrong to me is that I lived for five years with a bad man whom I hated . What seems right to me is that I lived for five years with a good man whom I love .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , yes , my dear , I know . But right and wrong do n't settle themselves as easily as that . We 've been living together when you were Telworthy 's wife . That 's wrong .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Do you mean wicked ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Well , no doubt the Court would consider that we acted in perfect innocence —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>What Court ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>These things have to be done legally , of course . I believe the proper method is a nullity suit , declaring our marriage null and — er — void . It would , so to speak , wipe out these years of — er —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Wickedness ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Of irregular union , and — er — then —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Then I could go back to Jacob . . . . Do you really mean that ,</l>
        <l>George ?</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>uneasily</stage>Well , dear , you see — that 's how things are — one can n't get away from — er ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>What you feel is that Telworthy has the greater claim ? You are prepared to — make way for him ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Both the Church and the Law would say that I had no claim at all , I 'm afraid . I — I suppose I have n't .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>I see .<stage>She looks at him curiously</stage>Thank you for making it so clear , George .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Of course , whether or not you go back to — er — Telworthy is another matter altogether . That would naturally be for you to decide .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>cheerfully</stage>For me and Jacko to decide .</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>I used to call my first husband — I mean my only husband — Jacko . I did n't like the name of Jacob , and Jacko seemed to suit him somehow . . . . He had very long arms . Dear Jacko .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>

       <p><stage>annoyed</stage>You do n't seem to realise that this is not a joke , Olivia .</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>I must say I do n't see anything funny in a tragedy that has wrecked two lives .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Two ? Oh , but Jacko 's life is n't wrecked . It has just been miraculously restored to him . And a wife , too . There 's nothing tragic for Jacko in it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>stiffly</stage>I was referring to our two lives — yours and mine .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Yours , George ? Your life is n't wrecked . The Court will absolve you of all blame ; your friends will sympathise with you , and tell you that I was a designing woman who deliberately took you in ; your Aunt Julia ——</p>

       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>There you go again . I do n't want to . I have hardly had time to realise just what it will mean to me when you go . The fact is I simply dare n't realise it . I dare n't think about it .</p>

       <p>Well , you 'll want to — to apologise to him for living with his wife for so long . And as I belong to him , he ought to be told where he can — call for me .</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Of course I do . It 's only that we do n't quite agree as to what is right and what is wrong .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>It is n't a question of agreeing . Right is right , and wrong is wrong , all the world over .</p>

       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>If I only considered myself , I should say : “ Let us pack this man Telworthy back to Australia . He would make no claim . He would accept money to go away and say nothing about it . ” If I consulted simply my own happiness , Olivia , that is what I should say . But when I consult — er ——</p>

       <p>Olivia , you do n't seriously suggest that we should discuss these things with a child like Dinah and a young man like Strange , a mere acquaintance .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Dinah will have to know . I 'm very fond of her , George . You can n't send me away without telling Dinah . And Brian is my friend . You have your solicitor and your aunt and your conscience to consult — may n't I even have Brian ?</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>I 'm afraid it 's true , Aunt Julia . We heard the news just before lunch — just before you came . We 've only this moment had an opportunity of talking about it , of wondering what to do .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY MARDEN</speaker>
       <p>What was his name — Tel — something —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Jacob Telworthy .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY MARDEN</speaker>
       <p>So he 's alive still ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Apparently . There seems to be no doubt about it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY MARDEN</speaker>
       <p><stage>to OLIVIA</stage>Did n't you see him die ? I should always want to see my husband die before I married again . Not that I approve of second marriages , anyhow . I told you so at the time , George .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>And me , Aunt Julia .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY MARDEN</speaker>
       <p>Did I ? Well , I generally say what I think .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>I ought to tell you , Aunt Julia , that no blame attaches to Olivia over this . Of that I am perfectly satisfied . It 's nobody 's fault , except ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY MARDEN</speaker>
       <p>Except Telworthy 's . He seems to have been rather careless . Well , what are you going to do about it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>That 's just it . It 's a terrible situation . There 's bound to be so much publicity . Not only all this , but — but Telworthy 's past and — and everything .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY MARDEN</speaker>
       <p>I should have said that it was Telworthy 's present which was the trouble . Had he a past as well ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>He was a fraudulent company promoter . He went to prison a good deal .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY MARDEN</speaker>
       <p>George , you never told me this !</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p><stage>indignantly</stage>What 's it got to do with Olivia , anyhow ? It 's not her fault .</p>

       <p>I do , Brian .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY MARDEN</speaker>
       <p>Well , go on , Mr . Strange . What would you do in George 's position ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>Do ? Say to the woman I loved , “ You 're mine , and let this other damned fellow come and take you from me if he can ! ” And he could n't — how could he ?— not if the woman chose me .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>LADY MARDEN gazes at BRIAN in amazement , GEORGE in anger , OLIVIA presses his hand gratefully . He has said what she has been waiting — oh , so eagerly — for GEORGE to say .</stage>

       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p><stage>adoringly</stage>Oh , Brian !<stage>In a whisper</stage>It is me , is n't it , and not Olivia ?</p>

       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>You baby , of course !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY MARDEN</speaker>
       <p>I 'm afraid , Mr . Strange , your morals are as peculiar as your views on Art . If you had led a more healthy life —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>This is not a question of morals or of art , it 's a question of love .</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>I will be good , Olivia , only I thought anybody , however important a debate was , was allowed to say “ Hear , hear ! ”</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>coldly</stage>I really think we could discuss this better if Mr . Strange took Dinah out for a walk . Strange , if you — er —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Tell them what you have settled first , George .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY MARDEN</speaker>
       <p>Settled ? What is there to be settled ? It settles itself .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>sadly</stage>That 's just it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY MARDEN</speaker>
       <p>The marriage must be annulled — is that the word , George ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>I presume so .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY MARDEN</speaker>
       <p>One 's solicitor will know all about that of course .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>And when the marriage has been annulled , what then ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY MARDEN</speaker>
       <p>Presumably Olivia will return to her husband .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p><stage>bitterly</stage>And that 's morality ! As expounded by Bishop Landseer !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>angered</stage>I do n't know what you mean by Bishop Landseer . Morality is acting in accordance with the Laws of the Land and the Laws of the Church . I am quite prepared to believe that your creed embraces neither marriage nor monogamy , but my creed is different .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p><stage>fiercely</stage>My creed includes both marriage and monogamy , and monogamy means sticking to the woman you love , as long as she wants you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY MARDEN</speaker>
       <p><stage>calmly</stage>You suggest that George and Olivia should go on living together , although they have never been legally married , and wait for this Telworthy man to divorce her , and then — bless the man , what do you think the County would say ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p><stage>scornfully</stage>Does it matter ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Well , if you really want to know , the men would say , “ Gad , she 's a fine woman ; I do n't wonder he sticks to her , ” and the women would say , “ I can n't think what he sees in her to stick to her like that , ” and they 'd both say , “ After all , he may be a damn fool , but you can n't deny he 's a sportsman . ” That 's what the County would say .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>indignantly</stage>Was it for this sort of thing , Olivia , that you insisted on having Dinah and Mr . Strange in here ? To insult me in my own house ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY MARDEN</speaker>
       <p>I can n't think what young people are coming to nowadays .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>I think , dear , you and Brian had better go .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p><stage>getting up</stage>We will go . But I 'm just going to say one thing , Uncle George . Brian and I are going to marry each other , and when we are married we 'll stick to each other , however many of our dead husbands and wives turn up !</p>

      <stage>She goes out indignantly , followed by BRIAN .</stage>
      <sp>

       <p>Upon my word , this is a pleasant discussion .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>I think the discussion is over , George . It is only a question of where I shall go , while you are bringing your — what sort of suit did you call it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY MARDEN</speaker>
       <p><stage>to GEORGE</stage>Nullity suit . I suppose that is the best thing ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>It 's horrible . The awful publicity . That it should be happening to us , that 's what I can n't get over .</p>

       <p>No . We shall all feel it . Terribly .</p>

       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>his apology</stage>If there were any other way ! Olivia , what can I do ? It is the only way , is n't it ? All that that fellow said — of course , it sounds very well — but as things are . . . . Is there anything in marriage , or is n't there ? You believe that there is , do n't you ? You are n't one of these Socialists . Well , then , can we go on living together when you 're another man 's wife ? It is n't only what people will say , but it is wrong , is n't it ? . . . And supposing he does n't divorce you , are we to go on living together , unmarried , for ever ? Olivia , you seem to think that I 'm just thinking of the publicity — what people will say . I 'm not . I 'm not . That comes in any way . But I want to do what 's right , what 's best . I do n't mean what 's best for us , what makes us happiest , I mean what 's really best , what 's rightest . What anybody else would do in my place . I do n't know . It 's so unfair . You 're not my wife at all , but I want to do what 's right . . . . Oh , Olivia , Olivia , you do understand , do n't you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>They have both forgotten LADY MARDEN . OLIVIA has never taken her eyes off him as he makes his last attempt to convince himself .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>almost tenderly</stage>So very very well , George . Oh , I understand just what you are feeling . And oh , I do so wish that you could —<stage>with a little sigh</stage>— but then it would n't be George , not the George I married —<stage>with a rueful little laugh</stage>— or did n't quite marry .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY MARDEN</speaker>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>PIM . A surprise , Mrs. Marden ? Dear me , not an unpleasant one , I hope ?</p>

       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Well , rather a — surprising one .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Olivia , allow me a moment . Mr. Pim , you mentioned a man called Telworthy this morning . My wife used to — that is to say , I used to — that is , there are reasons —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>I think we had better be perfectly frank , George .</p>

        <l>I am sixty-five years of age , Mr. Pim , and I can say that</l>
        <l>I 've never had a moment 's uneasiness by telling the truth .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>PIM<stage>after a desperate effort to keep up with the conversation</stage>Oh ! . . . I — er — I 'm afraid I am rather at sea . Have I — er — left anything unsaid in presenting my credentials to you this morning ? This Telworthy whom you mention — I seem to remember the name —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Mr. Pim , you told us this morning of a man whom you had met on the boat , a man who had come down in the world , whom you had known in Sydney . A man called Telworthy .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>PIM<stage>relieved</stage>Ah yes , yes , of course . I did say Telworthy , did n't I ? Most curious coincidence , Lady Marden . Poor man , poor man ! Let me see , it must have been ten years ago —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Just a moment , Mr. Pim . You 're quite sure that his name was</l>
        <l>Telworthy ?</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>PIM . Telworthy — Telworthy — did n't I say Telworthy ? Yes , that was it — Telworthy . Poor fellow !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>I 'm going to be perfectly frank with you , Mr. Pim . I feel quite sure that I can trust you . This man Telworthy whom you met is my husband .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>PIM . Your husband ?</l>
        <stage>He looks in mild surprise at GEORGE .</stage>

       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>My first husband . His death was announced six years ago . I had left him some years before that , but there seems no doubt from your story that he 's still alive . His record — the country he comes from — above all , the very unusual name — Telworthy .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>PIM . Telworthy — yes — certainly a most peculiar name . I remember saying so . Your first husband ? Dear me ! Dear me !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>You understand , Mr. Pim , that all this is in absolute confidence .</p>

       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>PIM . Of course , of course .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Well , since he is my husband , we naturally want to know something about him . Where is he now , for instance ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>PIM<stage>surprised</stage>Where is he now ? But surely I told you ? I told you what happened at Marseilles ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>At Marseilles ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>PIM . Yes , yes , poor fellow , it was most unfortunate .<stage>Quite happy again</stage>You must understand , Lady Marden , that although I had met the poor fellow before in Australia , I was never in any way intimate —</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>thumping the desk</stage>Where is he now , that 's what we want to know ?</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>Where is he now ? But — but did n't I tell you of the curious fatality at Marseilles — poor fellow — the fish-bone ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ALL</speaker>
       <p>Fish-bone ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>PIM . Yes , yes , a herring , I understand .</p>

       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>understanding first</stage>Do you mean he 's dead ?</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY MARDEN</speaker>
       <p>Pull yourself together , Olivia . This is so unhealthy for you .<stage>to PIM</stage>So he really is dead this time ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>PIM . Oh , undoubtedly , undoubtedly . A fishbone lodged in his throat .</p>

       <p>Now , let us have this quite clear , Mr. Pim . You say that the man , Telworthy , Jacob Telworthy , is dead ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>PIM . Telworthy , yes — did n't I say Telworthy ? This man I was telling you about —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>He 's dead ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>

      <sp>
       <speaker>LADY MARDEN</speaker>
       <p>A dispensation of Providence , George . One can look at it in no other light .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>If you had only told us the whole story at once , instead of in two — two instalments like this , you would have saved us all a good deal of anxiety .</p>

       <speaker>LADY MARDEN</speaker>
       <p>I am sure Mr. Pim meant well , George , but it seems a pity he could n't have said so before . If the man was dead , why try to hush it up ?</p>

       <p>Yes , George .</p>

       <p>I do n't want to interrupt , but ought n't you to be on your knees ? It is — usual , I believe . If one of the servants came in , you could say you were looking for my scissors .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Really , Olivia , you must allow me to manage my own proposal in my own way .</p>

       <p><stage>meekly</stage>I 'm sorry . Do go on .</p>

       <p>Well , er — confound it , Olivia , I love you . Will you marry me ?</p>

       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Thank you , George , I will think it over .</p>

       <p><stage>laughing</stage>Silly girl ! Well then , to-morrow morning . No wedding-cake , I 'm afraid , Olivia .<stage>He laughs again</stage>But we 'll go and have a good lunch somewhere .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>I will think it over , George .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>good-humouredly</stage>Well , give us a kiss while you 're thinking .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>I 'm afraid you must n't kiss me until we are actually engaged .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>laughing uneasily</stage>Oh , we need n't take it as seriously as all that .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>But a woman must take a proposal seriously .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>alarmed at last</stage>What do you mean ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>I mean that the whole question , as I heard somebody say once , demands much more anxious thought than either of us has given it . These hasty marriages —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Hasty !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Well , you 've only just proposed to me , and you want to marry me to-morrow .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Now you 're talking perfect nonsense , Olivia . You know quite well that our case is utterly different from — from any other .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>All the same , one has to ask oneself questions . With a young girl like — well , with a young girl , love may well seem to be all that matters . But with a woman of my age , it is different . I have to ask myself if you can afford to support a wife .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>coldly</stage>Fortunately that is a question that you can very easily answer for yourself .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Well , but I have been hearing rather bad reports lately . What with taxes always going up , and rents always going down , some of our landowners are getting into rather straitened circumstances . At least , so I 'm told .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>I do n't know what you 're talking about .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>surprised</stage>Oh , is n't it true ? I heard of a case only this morning — a landowner who always seemed to be very comfortably off , but who could n't afford an allowance for his only niece when she wanted to get married . It made me think that one ought n't to judge by appearances .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>You know perfectly well that I can afford to support a wife as my wife should be supported .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>I 'm so glad , dear . Then your income — you are n't getting anxious at all ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>stiffly</stage>You know perfectly well what my income is . I see no reason for anxiety in the future .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Ah , well , then we need n't think about that any more . Well , then , there is another thing to be considered .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>I can n't make out what you 're up to . Do n't you want to get married ; to — er — legalise this extraordinary situation in which we are placed ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>I want to be sure that I am going to be happy , George . I can n't just jump at the very first offer I have had since my husband died , without considering the whole question very carefully .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>So I 'm under consideration , eh ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Every suitor is .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>sarcastically , as he thinks</stage>Well , go on .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Well , then , there 's your niece . You have a niece who lives with you . Of course Dinah is a delightful girl , but one does n't like marrying into a household in which there is another grown-up woman . But perhaps she will be getting married herself soon ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>I see no prospect of it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>I think it would make it much easier if she did .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Is this a threat , Olivia ? Are you telling me that if I do not allow young Strange to marry Dinah , you will not marry me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>A threat ? Oh no , George .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Then what does it mean ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>I 'm just wondering if you love me as much as Brian loves</l>
        <l>Dinah . You do love me ?</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>from his heart</stage>You know I do , old girl .<stage>He comes to her .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>You 're not just attracted by my pretty face ? . . . Is it a pretty face ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>It 's an adorable one .<stage>He tries to kiss it , but she turns away .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>How can I be sure that it is not only my face which makes you think that you care for me ? Love which rests upon a mere outward attraction cannot lead to any lasting happiness — as one of our thinkers has observed .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>What 's come over you , Olivia ? I do n't understand what you 're driving at . Why should you doubt my love ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Ah !— Why ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>You can n't pretend that we have n't been happy together . I 've — I 've been a good pal to you , eh ? We — we suit each other , old girl .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Do we ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Of course we do .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>I wonder . When two people of our age think of getting married , one wants to be very sure that there is real community of ideas between them . Whether it is a comparatively trivial matter , like the right colour for a curtain , or some very much more serious question of conduct which arises , one wants to feel that there is some chance of agreement between husband and wife .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>We — we love each other , old girl .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>We do now , yes . But what shall we be like in five years ’ time ? Supposing that after we have been married five years , we found ourselves estranged from each other upon such questions as Dinah 's future , or the decorations of the drawing-room , or even the advice to give to a friend who had innocently contracted a bigamous marriage ? How bitterly we should regret then our hasty plunge into a matrimony which was no true partnership , whether of tastes , or of ideas , or even of consciences !<stage>With a sigh</stage>Ah me !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>nastily</stage>Unfortunately for your argument , Olivia , I can answer you out of your own mouth . You seem to have forgotten what you said this morning in the case of — er — young Strange .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>reproachfully</stage>Is it quite fair , George , to drag up what was said this morning ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>You 've brought it on yourself .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>I ? . . . Well , and what did I say this morning ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>You said that it was quite enough that Strange was a gentleman and in love with Dinah for me to let them marry each other .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Oh ! . . . Is that enough , George ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>triumphantly</stage>You said so .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>meekly</stage>Well , if you think so , too , I — I do n't mind risking it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>kindly</stage>Aha , my dear ! You see !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Then you do think it 's enough ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>I — er — Yes , yes , I — I think so .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>going to him</stage>My darling one ! Then we can have a double wedding . How jolly !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>astounded</stage>A double one !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Yes . You and me , Brian and Dinah .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>firmly</stage>Now look here , Olivia , understand once and for all , I am not to be blackmailed into giving my consent to Dinah 's engagement . Neither blackmailed nor tricked . Our marriage has nothing whatever to do with Dinah 's .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>No , dear . I quite understand . They may take place about the same time , but they have nothing to do with each other .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>I see no prospect of Dinah 's marriage taking place for many years .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>No , dear , that was what I said .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>not understanding for the moment</stage>You said . . . . ? I see . Now , Olivia , let us have this perfectly clear . You apparently insist on treating my — er — proposal as serious .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>surprised</stage>Was n't it serious ? Were you trifling with me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>You know quite well what I mean . You treat it as an ordinary proposal from a man to a woman who have never been more than acquaintances before . Very well then . Will you tell me what you propose to do , if you decide to — ah — refuse me ? You do not suggest that we should go on living together — unmarried ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>shocked</stage>Of course not , George ! What would the County — I mean Heaven — I mean the Law — I mean , of course not ! Besides , it 's so unnecessary . If I decide to accept you , of course I shall marry you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Quite so . And if you — ah — decide to refuse me ? What will you do ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Nothing .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Meaning by that ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Just that , George . I shall stay here — just as before . I like this house . It wants a little re-decorating perhaps , but I do like it , George . . . . Yes , I shall be quite happy here .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>I see . You will continue to live down here — in spite of what you said just now about the immorality of it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>surprised</stage>But there 's nothing immoral in a widow living alone in a big country house , with perhaps the niece of a friend of hers staying with her , just to keep her company .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>sarcastic</stage>And what shall I be doing , when you 've so very kindly taken possession of my house for me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>I do n't know , George . Travelling , I expect . You could come down sometimes with a chaperone . I suppose there would be nothing wrong in that .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>indignant</stage>Thank you ! And what if I refuse to be turned out of my house ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Then , seeing that we can n't both be in it , it looks as though you 'd have to turn me out .<stage>Casually</stage>I suppose there are legal ways of doing these things . You 'd have to consult your solicitor again .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>amazed</stage>Legal ways ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Well , you could n't throw me out , could you ? You 'd have to get an injunction against me — or prosecute me for trespass — or something . It would make an awfully unusual case , would n't it ? The papers would be full of it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>You must be mad !</p>

       <p><stage>angrily</stage>I 've had enough of this . Do you mean all this nonsense ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>I do mean , George , that I am in no hurry to go up to London and get married . I love the country just now , and<stage>with a sigh</stage>after this morning , I 'm — rather tired of husbands .</p>

      <stage>OLIVIA , who has forgiven him already , throws a loving kiss after him , and then turns triumphantly to her dear curtains . She takes them , smiling , to the sofa , and has just got to work again , when MR. PIM appears at the open windows .</stage>

       <p><stage>surprised</stage>No , I do n't think so . What is it ? You —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>

       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>Mrs. Marden , I throw myself on your mercy entirely . The fact is — his name was Polwittle .</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>But , really I ought to . . . .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p><stage>firmly</stage>Polwittle . It came back to me suddenly just as I reached the gate . For the moment , I had thoughts of conveying the news by letter . I was naturally disinclined to return in person , and — Polwittle .<stage>Proudly</stage>If you remember , I always said it was a curious name .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>But who is Polwittle ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p><stage>in surprise at her stupidity</stage>The man I have been telling you about , who met with the sad fatality at Marseilles . Henry Polwittle — or was it Ernest ? No , Henry , I think . Poor fellow .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>indignantly</stage>But you said his name was Telworthy ! How could you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>Yes , yes , I blame myself entirely .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>But how could you think of a name like Telworthy , if it was n't Telworthy ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p><stage>eagerly</stage>Ah , that is the really interesting thing about the whole matter .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Mr. Pim , all your visits here to-day have been interesting .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>Yes , but you see , on my first appearance here this morning , I was received by — er — Miss Diana .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Dinah .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>Miss Dinah , yes . She was in — er — rather a communicative mood , and she happened to mention , by way of passing the time , that before your marriage to Mr. Marden you had been a Mrs .— er —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Telworthy .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>Yes , yes , Telworthy , of course . She mentioned also Australia . By some process of the brain — which strikes me as decidedly curious — when I was trying to recollect the name of the poor fellow on the boat , whom you remember I had also met in Australia , the fact that this other name was also stored in my memory , a name equally peculiar — this fact I say . . .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>seeing that the sentence is rapidly going to pieces</stage>Yes , I understand .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>I blame myself , I blame myself entirely .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , you must n't do that , Mr. Pim . It was really Dinah 's fault for inflicting all our family history on you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>Oh , but a charming young woman . I assure you I was very much interested in all that she told me .<stage>Getting up</stage>Well , Mrs .— er — Marden , I can only hope that you will forgive me for the needless distress I have caused you to-day .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , you must n't worry about that — please .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>And you will tell your husband — you will break the news to him ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>smiling to herself</stage>I will — break the news to him .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>You understand how it is that I thought it better to come to you in the first place ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>I am very glad you did .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p><stage>holding out his hand</stage>Then I will say good-bye , and — er —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Just a moment , Mr. Pim . Let us have it quite clear this time . You never knew my husband , Jacob Telworthy , you never met him in Australia , you never saw him on the boat , and nothing whatever happened to him at Marseilles . Is that right ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>Yes , yes , that is so .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>So that , since he was supposed to have died in Australia six years ago , he is presumably still dead ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>Yes , yes , undoubtedly .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>holding out her hand with a charming smile</stage>Then good-bye , Mr. Pim , and thank you so much for — for all your trouble .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>Not at all , Mrs. Marden . I can only assure you I —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p><stage>from the window</stage>Hullo , here 's Mr. Pim !<stage>She comes in , followed by BRIAN .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p><stage>anxiously looking at the door in case MR. MARDEN should come in</stage>Yes , yes , I — er —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Oh , Mr. Pim , you must n't run away without even saying how do you do ! Such old friends as we are . Why , it is ages since I saw you ! Are you staying to tea ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>I 'm afraid I —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Mr. Pim has to hurry away , Dinah . You must n't keep him .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Well , but you 'll come back again ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p>I fear that I am only a passer-by , Miss — er — Dinah .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>You can walk with him to the gate , dear .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>PIM</speaker>
       <p><stage>gratefully to OLIVIA</stage>Thank you .<stage>He edges towards the window</stage>If you would be so kind , Miss Dinah —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>I 'll catch you up .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Come along then , Mr. Pim .<stage>As they go out</stage>I want to hear all about your first wife . You have n't really told me anything yet .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>OLIVIA resumes her work , and BRIAN sits on the back of the sofa looking at her .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p><stage>awkwardly</stage>I just wanted to say , if you do n't think it cheek , that I 'm — I 'm on your side , if I may be , and if I can help you at all I should be very proud of being allowed to .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking up at him</stage>Brian , you dear . That 's sweet of you . . . But it 's quite all right now , you know .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>Oh , I 'm so glad .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Yes , that 's what Mr. Pim came back to say . He 'd made a mistake about the name .<stage>Smiling</stage>George is the only husband I have .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p><stage>surprised</stage>What ? You mean that the whole thing — that Pim —<stage>With conviction</stage>Silly ass !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>kindly</stage>Oh , well , he did n't mean to be .<stage>After a pause</stage>Brian , do you know anything about the Law ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>I 'm afraid not . I hate the Law . Why ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>casually</stage>Oh , I just — I was wondering — thinking about all the shocks we 've been through to-day . Second marriages , and all that .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>Oh ! It 's a rotten business .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>I suppose there 's nothing wrong in getting married to the same person twice ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>A hundred times if you like , I should think .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Oh ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>After all , in France , they always go through it twice , do n't they ? Once before the Mayor or somebody , and once in church .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Of course they do ! How silly of me . . . I think it 's rather a nice idea . They ought to do it in England more .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>Well , once will be enough for Dinah and me , if you can work it .<stage>Anxiously</stage>D'you think there 's any chance , Olivia ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>smiling</stage>Every chance , dear .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p><stage>jumping up</stage>I say , do you really ? Have you squared him ? I mean , has he —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Go and catch them up now . We 'll talk about it later on .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>Bless you . Righto .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>As he goes out by the windows , GEORGE comes in at the door . GEORGE stands looking after him , and then turns to OLIVIA , who is absorbed in her curtains . He walks up and down the room , fidgeting with things , waiting for her to speak . As she says nothing , he begins to talk himself , but in an obviously unconcerned way . There is a pause after each answer of hers , before he gets out his next remark .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>casually</stage>Good-looking fellow , Strange .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>equally casually</stage>Brian — yes , is n't he ? And such a nice boy . . .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Got fifty pounds for a picture the other day , did n't he ? Hey ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Yes . Of course he has only just begun . . . .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Critics think well of him , what ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>They all say he has genius . Oh , I do n't think there 's any doubt about it . . .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Of course , I do n't profess to know anything about painting .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>You 've never had time to take it up , dear .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>I know what I like , of course . Ca n't say I see much in this new-fangled stuff . If a man can paint , why can n't he paint like — like Rubens or — or Reynolds ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>I suppose we all have our own styles . Brian will find his directly . Of course , he 's only just beginning . . . .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>But they think a lot of him , what ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Oh yes !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>H 'm ! . . . Good-looking fellow .<stage>There is rather a longer silence this time , GEORGE continues to hope that he is appearing casual and unconcerned . He stands looking at OLIVIA 'S work for a moment .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Nearly finished ‘ em ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Very nearly . Are my scissors there ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking round</stage>Scissors ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Ah , here they are . . . .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Where are you going to put ‘ em ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>as if really wondering</stage>I do n't quite know . . . . I had thought of this room , but — I 'm not quite sure .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Brighten the room up a bit .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Yes . . . .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>walking over to the present curtains</stage>H 'm . They are a bit faded .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>shaking out hers , and looking at them critically</stage>Sometimes I think I love them , and sometimes I 'm not quite sure .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Best way is to hang ‘ em up and see how you like ‘ em then . Always take ‘ em down again .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>That 's rather a good idea , George !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Best way .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Yes . . . . I think we might do that . . . . The only thing is —<stage>she hesitates</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>What ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Well , the carpet and the chairs , and the cushions and things —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>What about ‘ em ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Well , if we had new curtains —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>You 'd want a new carpet , eh ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>doubtfully</stage>Y — yes . Well , new chair-covers anyhow .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>H 'm . . . . Well , why not ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , but —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>with an awkward laugh</stage>We 're not so hard up as all that , you know .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>No , I suppose not .</l>
        <stage>Thoughtfully</stage>
        <l>I suppose it would mean that</l>
        <l>I should have to go up to London for them . That 's rather a nuisance .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>extremely casual</stage>Oh , I do n't know . We might go up together one day .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Well , of course if we were up — for anything else — we could just look about us , and see if we could find what we want .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>That 's what I meant .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>There is another silence . GEORGE is wondering whether to come to closer quarters with the great question .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , by the way , George —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Yes ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>innocently</stage>I told Brian , and I expect he 'll tell Dinah , that Mr. Pim had made a mistake about the name .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>astonished</stage>You told Brian that Mr. Pim —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Yes — I told him that the whole thing was a mistake . It seemed the simplest way .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Olivia ! Then you mean that Brian and Dinah think that — that we have been married all the time ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Yes . . . They both think so now .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>coming close to her</stage>Olivia , does that mean that you are thinking of marrying me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>At your old Registry Office ?</p>

       <p>Yes !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Do you want me to very much ?</p>

      <sp>

       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>a little apprehensive</stage>We should have to do it very quietly .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Of course , darling . Nobody need know at all . We do n't want anybody to know . And now that you 've put Brian and Dinah off the scent , by telling them that Mr. Pim made a mistake —<stage>He breaks off , and says admiringly</stage>That was very clever of you , Olivia . I should never have thought of that .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>innocently</stage>No , darling . . . . You do n't think it was wrong , George ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>his verdict</stage>An innocent deception . . . perfectly harmless .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Yes , dear , that was what I thought about — about what I was doing .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Then you will come to-morrow ?<stage>She nods .</stage>And if we happen to see the carpet , or anything that you want —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , what fun !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>beaming</stage>And a wedding lunch at the Carlton , what ?<stage>She nods eagerly .</stage>And — and a bit of a honeymoon in Paris ?</p>
      </sp>

       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , George !</p>

       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>hungrily</stage>Give us a kiss , old girl .</p>

       <p><stage>lovingly</stage>George !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>She holds up her cheek to him . He kisses it , and then suddenly takes her in his arms .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Do n't ever leave me , old girl .</p>
      </sp>

       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>affectionately</stage>Do n't ever send me away , old boy .</p>

       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>fervently</stage>I wo n't . . . .<stage>Awkwardly</stage>I — I do n't think I would have , you know . I — I —</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>DINAH and BRIAN appear at the windows , having seen MR. PIM safely off .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p><stage>surprised</stage>Oo , I say !</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p><stage>going up impetuously to him</stage>Give me one , too , George ; Brian wo n't mind .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>Really , Dinah , you are the limit .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>formally , but enjoying it</stage>Do you mind , Mr . Strange ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p><stage>a little uncomfortably</stage>Oh , I say , sir —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>We 'll risk it , Dinah .<stage>He kisses her .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p><stage>triumphantly to BRIAN</stage>Did you notice that one ? That was n't just an ordinary affectionate kiss . It was a special bless — you — my — children one .<stage>to GEORGE</stage>Was n't it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>You do talk nonsense , darling .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Well , I 'm so happy , now that Mr. Pim has relented about your first husband —</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>GEORGE catches OLIVIA 'S eye and smiles ; she smiles back ; but they are different smiles .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>the actor</stage>Yes , yes , stupid fellow Pim , what ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>Absolute idiot .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>— And now that George has relented about my first husband .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>You get on much too quickly , young woman .<stage>to BRIAN</stage>So you want to marry my Dinah , eh ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p><stage>with a smile</stage>Well , I do rather , sir .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p><stage>hastily</stage>Not at once , of course , George . We want to be engaged for a long time first , and write letters to each other , and tell each other how much we love each other , and sit next to each other when we go out to dinner .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>to OLIVIA</stage>Well , that sounds fairly harmless , I think .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>smiling</stage>I think so . . . .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>to BRIAN</stage>Then you 'd better have a talk with me — er — Brian .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>Thank you very much , sir .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Well , come along then .<stage>Looking at his watch</stage>I am going up to town after tea , so we 'd better —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>I say ! Are you going to London ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>with the smile of the conspirator</stage>A little business . Never you mind , young lady .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p><stage>calmly</stage>All right . Only , bring me back something nice .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>to BRIAN</stage>Shall we walk down and look at the pigs ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p>Righto !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Do n't go far , dear . I may want you in a moment .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>All right , darling , we 'll be on the terrace .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>They go out together .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Brian and George always try to discuss me in front of the pigs . So tactless of them . Are you going to London , too , darling ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>To-morrow morning .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>What are you going to do in London ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , shopping , and — one or two little things .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>With George ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Yes . . . .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>I say , was n't it lovely about Pim ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Lovely ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Yes ; he told me all about it . Making such a hash of things , I mean .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>innocently</stage>Did he make a hash of things ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>Well , I mean keeping on coming like that . And if you look at it all round — well , for all he had to say , he need n't really have come at all .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>smiling to herself</stage>I should n't quite say that , Dinah .<stage>She stands up and shakes out the curtains .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>I say , are n't they jolly ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p><stage>demurely</stage>I 'm so glad everybody likes them . Tell George I 'm ready , will you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p>I say , is he going to hang them up for you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Well , I thought he could reach best .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Righto ! What fun !</l>
        <stage>At the windows</stage>
        <l>George ! George !</l>
        <stage>to OLIVIA</stage>
        <l>Brian is just telling George about the five shillings he 's got in the</l>
        <l>Post Office . . . . George !</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p><stage>from the terrace</stage>Coming !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>He hurries in , the model husband , BRIAN follows .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLIVIA</speaker>
       <p>Oh , George , just hang these up for me , will you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GEORGE</speaker>
       <p>Of course , darling . I 'll get the steps from the library .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>He hurries out .</stage>
      <stage>BRIAN takes out his sketching block . It is obvious that his five shillings has turned the scale . He bows to DINAH . He kisses OLIVIA 'S hand with an air . He motions to DINAH to be seated .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>DINAH</speaker>
       <p><stage>impressed</stage>What is it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRIAN</speaker>
       <p><stage>beginning to draw</stage>Portrait of Lady Strange .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>GEORGE hurries in with the steps , and gets to work . There is a great deal of curtain , and for the moment he becomes slightly involved in it . However , by draping it over his head and shoulders , he manages to get successfully up the steps . There we may leave him .</stage>
      <stage>But we have not quite finished with MR. PIM . It is a matter of honour with him now that he should get his little story quite accurate before passing out of the MARDENS ’ life for ever . So he comes back for the last time ; for the last time we see his head at the window . He whispers to OLIVIA .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>PIM . Mrs. Marden ! I 've just remembered . His name was Ernest</l>
        <l>Polwittle — not Henry .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <stage>He goes off happily . A curious family the MARDENS . Perhaps somebody else would have committed bigamy if he had not remembered in time that it was Ernest . . . . Ernest . . . . Yes . . . . Now he can go back with an easy conscience to the Trevors .</stage>

     <stage>THE CAMBERLEY TRIANGLE</stage>
     <stage>It is an evening of 1919 in KATE 'S drawing-room . She is expecting him , and the Curtain goes up as he is announced .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MAID</speaker>
      <p>Mr. Cyril Norwood .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He comes in .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>for the MAID 'S benefit , but you may be sure she knows</stage>Ah , good evening , Mrs. Camberley !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>Good evening !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>They shake hands . NORWOOD is sleek and prosperous , in a morning coat with a white slip to his waistcoat . He is good-looking in rather an obvious way with rather an obvious moustache . Most women like him — at least , so he will tell you .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>as soon as they are alone</stage>My darling !</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>Cyril !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He takes her hands and kisses them . He would kiss her face , but she is not quite ready for this .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>You let me yesterday . Why may n't I kiss you to-day ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>Not just yet , dear . I want to talk to you . Come and sit down .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>They sit on the sofa together .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>You are n't sorry for what you said yesterday ?</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p><stage>looking at him thoughtfully , and then shaking her head</stage>No .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>Then what 's happened ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>I 've just had a letter from Dennis .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>anxiously</stage>Dennis — your husband ?</p>

      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>Yes .</p>
     </sp>

      <p>Where does he write from ?</p>

      <p>India .</p>

      <p>Oh , well !</p>

      <p>He says I may expect him home almost as soon as I get the letter .</p>

      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>Good Heavens !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>Yes . . . .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>always hopeful</stage>Perhaps he did n't catch the boat that he expected to . Would n't he have cabled from somewhere on the way ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>You can n't depend on cables nowadays . I do n't know — What are we to do , Cyril ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>You know what I always wanted you to do .</l>
       <stage>He takes her hands</stage>
       <l>Come away with me .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p><stage>doubtfully</stage>And let Dennis come home and find — an empty house ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>eagerly</stage>You are nothing to him , and he is nothing to you . A war-wedding !— after you 'd been engaged to each other for a week ! And forty-eight hours afterwards he is sent out to India — and you have n't seen him since .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>Yes . I keep telling myself that .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>The world may say that you 're his wife and he 's your husband , but — what do you know of him ? He wo n't even be the boy you married . He 'll be a stranger whom you 'll hardly recognise . And you are n't the girl he married . You 're a woman now , and you 're just beginning to learn what love is . Come with me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>It 's true , it 's true . But he has been fighting for us . And to come home again after those four years of exile , and find —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>Exile — that 's making much too much of it . He 's come through the war safely , and he 's probably had what he 'd call a topping good time . Like enough he 's been in love half-a-dozen times himself since — on leave in India and that sort of thing . India ! Well , you should read Kipling .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>I wonder . Of course , as you say , I do n't know him . But I feel that we should be happier afterwards if we were quite straight about it and told him just what had happened . If he had been doing what you say , he would understand — and perhaps be glad of it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>uneasily</stage>Really , darling , it 's hardly a thing you can talk over calmly with a husband , even if he — We do n't want any unpleasantness , and — er —<stage>Taking her hands again</stage>Besides , I want you , Kate . It may be weeks before he comes back . We can n't go on like this . . . Kate !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>Do you love me so very much ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>My darling !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>Well , let us wait till the end of the week — in case he comes . I do n't want to seem to be afraid of him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>eagerly</stage>And then ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>Then I 'll come with you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>taking her in his arms</stage>My darling ! . . . There ! And now what are you going to do ? Ask me to stay to dinner or what ?</p>

      <p>Certainly not , sir . I 'm going out to dinner to-night .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>eagerly</stage>At our little restaurant ?<stage>She nods</stage>Good girl ! Then go and put on a hat , while I ring ‘ em up and see if they 've got a table .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>What fun ! I wo n't be a moment .<stage>She goes to the door</stage>Cyril , you will always love me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>Of course I will , darling .<stage>She nods at him and goes out . He is very well pleased with himself when he is left alone . He goes to the telephone with a smile</stage>Gerrard 11 , 001 . Yes . . . I want a table for two . To-night . . . Mr. Cyril Norwood . . . Oh , in about half an hour . . . Yes , for two . Is that all right ? . . . Thank you .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He puts the receiver back and turns round to see DENNIS CAMBERLEY , who has just come in . DENNIS is certainly a man now ; very easily and pleasantly master of himself and of anybody else who gets in his way .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>surprised</stage>Hallo !</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>I just came in , Mr. Norwood .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>You know my name ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>Oh yes , I 've heard a good deal about you , Mr. Cyril Norwood .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>stiffly</stage>I do n't think I 've had the pleasure of — er ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p><stage>winningly</stage>Oh , but I 'm sure you must have heard a good deal about me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>Good God , you do n't mean ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>I do , indeed .<stage>With a bow</stage>Dennis Camberley , the missing husband .<stage>Pleadingly</stage>You have heard about me , have n't you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>I — er — Mr. Camberley , yes , of course . So you 're back ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>Yes , I 'm back . Sometimes they do n't come back , Mr. Norwood , and sometimes — they do . . . . Even after four years . . . . But you did talk about me sometimes ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>How did you know my name ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>A little bird told me about you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>turning away in anger</stage>Pooh !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>One of those little Eastern birds , which sit on the backs of crocodiles , searching for — well , let us say , breakfast . He said to me one morning : “ Talking of parasites , ” he said , “ do you know Mr. Cyril Norwood ? ” he said , “ because I could tell you an interesting story about him , ” he said , “ if you care to — ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>wheeling round furiously</stage>Look here , sir , we 'd better have it out quite plainly . I do n't want any veiled insults and sneers from you . I admit that an unfortunate situation has arisen , but we must look facts in the face . You may be Mrs. Camberley 's husband , but she has not seen you for four years , and — well , she and I love each other . There you have it . What are you going to do ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p><stage>anxiously</stage>You do n't feel that I have neglected her , Mr. Norwood ? You see , I could n't come home for week-ends very well , and —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>What are you going to do ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p><stage>pleasantly</stage>Well , what do you suggest ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>taken aback</stage>Really , sir , I — er —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>You see , I feel so out of it all . I 've been leading such a nasty , uncivilised life for the last four years , I really hardly know what is — what is being done . Now you have been mixing in Society . . . making munitions . . .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>stiffly</stage>I have been engaged on important work for the Government of a confidential nature —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>You , as I was saying , have been mixing in Society , engaged on important work for the Government of a confidential nature ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>It was my great regret that I had no opportunity of enlisting ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>With no opportunity , as I was about to say , of enlisting , but with many opportunities , fortunately , of making love to my wife .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>Now look here , Mr. Camberley , I 've already told you ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p><stage>soothing him</stage>But , my dear Mr. Norwood , I 'm only doing what you said . I 'm looking facts in the face .<stage>Surprised</stage>You are n't ashamed of having made love to my wife , are you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>impatiently</stage>What are you going to do ? That 's all that matters between you and me . What are you going to do ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>Well , that was what I was going to ask you . You 're so much more in the swim than I am .<stage>Earnestly</stage>What is being done in Society just now ? You must have heard a good deal of gossip about it . All your friends , who were also engaged on important work of a confidential nature , with no opportunity of enlisting — do n't they tell you their own experiences ? What have the husbands been doing lately when they came back from the front ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>advancing on him angrily</stage>Now , once and for all , sir ——</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>KATE comes in , with a hat in each hand , calling to NORWOOD as she comes .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>Oh , Cyril — which of these two hats —<stage>she sees her husband</stage>— Dennis !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p><stage>looking at her steadfastly</stage>How are you , Kate ?</p>

      <p><stage>smiling</stage>Oh , we 're quite old friends .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>going to her</stage>I 've told him , Kate .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He takes her hands , and tries to look defiantly at DENNIS , though he is not feeling like that at all .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p><stage>looking anxiously at DENNIS</stage>What are you going to do ?</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>She can hardly make him out . He is different from the husband who left her four years ago .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>Well , that 's what Cyril keeps asking me .<stage>to NORWOOD</stage>You do n't mind my calling you Cyril ?— such an old friend of my wife 's —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p><stage>unable to make him out</stage>Dennis !<stage>She is frightened .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>soothingly</stage>It 's all right , dear .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>Do let 's sit down and talk it over in a friendly way .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p><stage>going to him</stage>Dennis , can you ever forgive me ? We never ought to have got married — we knew each other so little — you had to go away so soon — I — I was going to write and tell you — oh , I wish —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>That 's all right , Kate .<stage>He will not let her come too close to him . He steps back and looks at her from head to feet</stage>You 've altered .</p>

      <p>That 's just it , Dennis . I 'm not the girl who —</p>

      <p>Yes . . . . You do your hair a new way .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a start</stage>I beg your pardon , Cyril . I was forgetting you for the moment . Well , now do sit down ,<stage>NORWOOD and KATE sit down together on the sofa , but DENNIS remains standing</stage>That 's right .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>We have already told you the circumstances , Mr. Camberley . I need hardly say how regrettable it is that — er — but at the same time these — er — things will happen , and since it — er — has happened —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>I feel I hardly know you , Dennis . Did I love you when I married you ? I do n't know . It was so sudden . We had no time to find out anything about each other . And now you come back — a stranger —</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p><stage>sharply</stage>It would n't be distressing for her , if you did n't keep messing her about . Why the devil can n't you sit on a chair by yourself ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>indignantly</stage>Really !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p><stage>freeing herself from him , and moving to the extreme end of the sofa</stage>What are you going to do , Dennis ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p><stage>looking at them thoughtfully , his chin on his hand</stage>I do n't know . . . . It 's difficult . I do n't want to do anything melodramatic . I mean<stage>to KATE</stage>it would n't really help matters if I did shoot him , would it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>KATE looks at him without saying anything , trying to understand this new man who has come into her life . NORWOOD swallows , and tries very hard to say something</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>I — I —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p>I — I —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>No , I 'm quite sure you 're right . It would n't really help . It is difficult , is n't it ? You see<stage>to KATE</stage>you love him —<stage>he waits a moment for her to say it if she will , but she only looks at him</stage>— and he says he loves you , but at the same time I am your husband . . . .<stage>He walks up and down thoughtfully , and then says suddenly to NORWOOD</stage>I 'll tell you what — I 'll fight you for her .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>trying to be firm</stage>I think we 'd better leave this eighteenth-century nonsense out of it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p><stage>pleasantly</stage>They fight in the twentieth century , too , Mr. Norwood . Perhaps you had n't heard what we 've been doing these last four years ? Oh , quite a lot of it . . . . Well ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>You do n't wish me to believe that you 're serious ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>Perfectly . Swords , pistols , fists , catch-as-catch-can — what would you like ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>I do not propose to indulge in an undignified scuffle for the — er — lady of my heart .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p><stage>cheerfully</stage>Nothing doing in scuffles , eh ? All right , then , I 'll toss you for her .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>Now you 're merely being vulgar .<stage>to KATE</stage>My dear —</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>She motions him back with her hand , but does not take her eyes off DENNIS .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>Really , Mr. Norwood , you 're a little hard to please . If you do n't like my suggestions , perhaps you will make one of your own .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>This is obviously a matter in which it is for the — er — lady to choose .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>You think Mrs. Camberley should choose between us ?</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>Certainly .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p>What do you say , Kate ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>You are very generous , Dennis .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p><stage>after a pause</stage>Very well , you shall choose .</p>

      <p><stage>complacently</stage>Ah !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>Wait a moment , Mr. Norwood .<stage>to KATE</stage>When did you first meet him ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>A year ago .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>And he 's been making love to you for a year ?<stage>KATE bends her head</stage>He 's been making love to you for a year ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>I think , sir , that the sooner the lady makes her choice , and brings this distressing scene to a close — After all , is it fair to her to —?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>Are you fair to me ? You 've been making love to her for a year . I made love to her for a fort-night — four years ago . And now you want her to choose between us . Is that fair ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>You hardly expect us to wait a year before she is allowed to make up her mind ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>I waited four years for her out there . . . . However , I wo n't ask you to wait a year . I 'll ask you to wait for five minutes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>What is it you want us to do , Dennis ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>I want you to listen to both of us , for five minutes each ; that 's all . After all , we 're your suitors , are n't we ? You 're going to choose between us . Very well , then , you must hear what we have to say . Mr. Norwood shall have five minutes alone with you in which to present his case ; five minutes in which to tell you how beautiful you are . . . . and how rich he is . . . and how happy you 'll be together . And I shall have my five minutes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>sneering</stage>Five minutes in which to tell her lies about me , eh ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>Damn it , you 've had a whole year in which to tell her lies about yourself ; you ought n't to grudge me five minutes .<stage>to KATE</stage>Well ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>I agree , Dennis .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p><stage>smiling in spite of herself</stage>A gas-fire ; it is n't lit .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>Then I shall light it .<stage>to NORWOOD</stage>That will make the room nice and warm for you by the time you 've finished .<stage>He goes to the door and says again</stage>Five minutes .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>There is an awkward silence after he is gone . KATE waits for NORWOOD to say something , but NORWOOD does n't know in the least what is expected of him .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>looking anxiously at the door</stage>What 's the fellow 's game , eh ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>Game ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>Yes . What 's he up to ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>Is he up to anything ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>I do n't like it . Why the devil did he choose to-day to come back ? If he 'd waited another week , we 'd have been safely away together . What 's his game , I wonder ?</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He walks up and down , worrying it out .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>I do n't think he 's playing a game . He 's just giving me my chance .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>What chance ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>A chance to decide between you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>You 've decided that , Kate . You 've had a year to think about it in , and you 've decided . We love each other ; you 're coming away with me ; that 's all settled . Only . . . what the deuce is he up to ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p><stage>sitting down and talking to herself</stage>You 're quite right about my not knowing him . . . . How one rushed into marriage in those early days of the war — knowing nothing about each other . And then they come back , and even the little one thought one did know is different . . . . I suppose he feels the same about me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>to himself</stage>Damn him !</p>

      <p><stage>after a pause</stage>Well , Cyril ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>looking sharply round at her</stage>Well ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>We have n't got very long .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>looking at his watch</stage>He really means to come back — in five minutes ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>You heard him say so .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>going up to her and speaking eagerly</stage>What 's the matter with slipping out now ? You 've got a hat here . We can slip out quietly . He wo n't hear us . He 'll come back and find us gone — well , what can he do ? Probably he 'll hang about for a bit and then go to his club . We 'll have a bit of dinner ; ring up your maid ; get her to meet you with some things , and go off by the night mail . Scotland — anywhere you like . Let the whole business simmer down a bit . We do n't want any melodramatic eighteenth-century nonsense .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>Go out now , and not wait for him to have his five minutes ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>impatiently</stage>What does he want with five minutes ? What 's the good of it to him ? Just to take a pathetic farewell of you , and pretend that you 've ruined his life , when all the time he 's chuckling in his sleeve at having got rid of you so easily . I know these young fellows . Some Major 's wife in India is what he 's got his eye on . . . . Or else he 'll try fooling around with the hands-up business . You do n't want to be mixed up with any scandal of that sort . No , the best thing we can do — I 'm speaking for your sake , Kate — is to slip off quietly , while we 've got the chance . We can write and explain all that we want to explain .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p><stage>looking wonderingly at him — another man whom she does n't know</stage>Is that playing quite fair to Dennis ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>Good Lord , this is n't a game ! Camberley may think so with his tossing-up and all the rest of it , but you and I are n't children . Everything 's fair in a case like this . Put your hat on — quickly —<stage>he gets it for her</stage>— here you are —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p><stage>standing up</stage>I 'm not sure , Cyril .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>What d'you mean ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>He expects me to wait for him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>If it comes to that , he expected you to wait for him four years ago .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>Yes . . . .<stage>Quietly</stage>Thank you for reminding me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>Kate , do n't be stupid . What 's happened to you ? Of course , I know it 's been beastly upsetting for you , all this — but then , why do you want to go on with it ? Why do you want more upsetting scenes ? You 've got a chance now of getting out of it all , and —<stage>He looks at his watch</stage>Good Lord !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>Is the five minutes over ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>Quick , quick !<stage>He puts his fingers to his lips</stage>Quietly .<stage>He walks on tiptoe to the door .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>Cyril !</p>

      <p><stage>sitting down again</stage>It 's no good , Cyril , I must wait for him .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>The door opens , and NORWOOD starts back quickly as DENNIS comes in .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p><stage>looking at his watch</stage>Innings declared closed .<stage>to NORWOOD</stage>The dining-room is nicely warmed now , and I 've left you an evening paper .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>going to KATE</stage>Look here , Mr. Camberley , Kate and I —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>Mrs. Camberley , no doubt , will tell me .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He holds the door open and waits politely for NORWOOD to go .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>I do n't know what your game is —</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>You 've never been in Mesopotamia , Mr. Norwood ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p>Never .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>It 's a very trying place for the temper . . . . I 'm waiting for you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>irresolute</stage>Well , I ——<stage>He comes sulkily to the door</stage>Well , I shall come back for Kate in five minutes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>Mrs. Camberley and I will be ready for you . You know your way ?</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>NORWOOD goes out .</stage>
     <stage>DENNIS shuts the door . He comes into the room and stands looking at KATE .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p><stage>uncomfortably</stage>Well ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>No , do n't move . I just want to look at you . . . . I 've seen you like that for four years . Do n't move . . . . I 've been in some dreary places , but you 've been with me most of the time . Just let 's have a last look .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>A last look ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>You 're saying good-bye to me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>I do n't know whether it 's to you , Kate . To the girl who has been with me these last four years . Was that you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p><stage>dropping her eyes</stage>I do n't know , Dennis .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>I wish to God I was n't your husband .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>What would you do if you were n't my husband ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>Make love to you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>Ca n't you do that now ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>Being your husband rather handicaps me , you know . I never really stood a chance against the other fellow .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>I was to choose between you , you said . You think that I have already made up my mind ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p><stage>smiling</stage>I think so .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>And chosen him ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p><stage>shaking his head</stage>Oh , no !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p><stage>surprised</stage>You think I have chosen you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p><stage>nodding</stage>M 'm .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p><stage>indignantly</stage>Really , Dennis ! Considering that I had practically arranged to run away with him twenty minutes ago ! You must think me very fickle .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>Not fickle . Imaginative .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>What do you mean ? And why are you so certain that I am going to choose you ? And why in that case did you talk about taking a last look at me ? And what —?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>Of course , we 've only got five minutes , but I think that if you asked your questions one at a time ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p><stage>smiling</stage>Well , you need n't answer them all together .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>All right then , one at a time . Why am I certain that you will choose me ? Because for the first time in your life you have just been alone with Mr. Cyril Norwood . That 's what I meant by saying you were imaginative . The Norwood you 've been thinking yourself in love with does n't exist . I 'm certain that you 've seen him for the first time in these last few minutes . Why , the Archangel Gabriel would have made a hash of a five minutes like that ; it would have been impossible for him to have said the right thing to you . Norwood ? Good Lord , he did n't stand a chance . You were judging him all the time , were n't you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p><stage>thoughtfully</stage>You 're very clever , Dennis .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p><stage>cheerfully</stage>Four years ’ study of the Turkish character .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>But how do you know I 'm not judging you all the time ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>Of course you are . But there 's all the difference in the world between judging a stranger like me , and judging the man you thought you were in love with .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>You are a stranger to me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>I know . That 's why I said good-bye to the girl who had been with me these last four years , the girl I had married . Well , I 've said good-bye to her . You 're not my wife any longer , Kate ; but if you do n't mind pretending that I 'm not your husband , and just give me a chance of making love to you — well , that 's all I want .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>KATE</speaker>
      <p>You 're very generous , Dennis .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>No , I 'm not . I 'm very much in love ; and for a man very much in love I 'm being rather less of a silly ass than usual . Why should you love me ? You fell in love with my uniform at the beginning of the war . I was ordered out , and you fell in love with the departing hero . After that ? Well , I had four years — alone — in which to think about you , and you had four years — with other men — in which to forget me . Is it any wonder that —?</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>NORWOOD comes in .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORWOOD</speaker>
      <p><stage>roughly</stage>Well ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
      <p>You arrive just in time , Mr. Norwood . I was talking too much .<stage>to KATE</stage>Mrs. Camberley , we are both at your disposal . Will you choose between us , which one is to have the happiness of — serving you ?</p>

      <head type="act">ACT I</head>
      <stage>We are looking at the inner hall of MR. HENRY KNOWLE 'S country house , at about 9. 15 of a June evening . There are doors R. and L .— on the right leading to the drawing-room , on the left to the entrance hall , the dining-room and the library . At the back are windows — French windows on the right , then an interval of wall , then casement windows .</stage>
      <stage>MRS. HENRY KNOWLE , her daughter , MELISANDE , and her niece , JANE BAGOT , are waiting for their coffee , MRS. KNOWLE , short and stoutish , is reclining on the sofa ; JANE , pleasant-looking and rather obviously pretty , is sitting in a chair near her , glancing at a book ; MELISANDE , the beautiful , the romantic , is standing by the open French windows , gazing into the night .</stage>
      <stage>ALICE , the parlourmaid , comes in with the coffee . She stands in front of MRS. KNOWLE , a little embarrassed because MRS. KNOWLE 'S eyes are closed . She waits there until JANE looks up from her book .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Aunt Mary , dear , are you having coffee ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE<stage>opening her eyes with a start</stage>Coffee . Oh , yes , coffee . Jane , put the milk in for me . And no sugar . Dr. Anderson is very firm about that . “ No sugar , Mrs. Knowle , ” he said . “ Oh , Dr. Anderson ! ” I said .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>ALICE has taken the tray to JANE , who pours out her own and her aunt 's coffee , and takes her cup off the tray .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Thank you .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>ALICE takes the tray to MRS. KNOWLE .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Thank you .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>ALICE goes over to MELISANDE , who says nothing , but waves her away .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE<stage>as soon as ALICE is gone</stage>Jane !</p>
      </sp>

       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , Aunt Mary ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Was my mouth open ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , no , Aunt Mary .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Ah , I 'm glad of that . It 's so bad for the servants .<stage>She finishes her coffee .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p><stage>getting up</stage>Shall I put it down for you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Thank you , dear .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>JANE puts the two cups down and goes back to her book . MRS. KNOWLE fidgets a little on her sofa .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Sandy !<stage>There is no answer</stage>Sandy !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Melisande !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MELISANDE turns round and comes slowly towards her mother .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Did you call me , Mother ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Three times , darling . Did n't you hear me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>I am sorry , Mother , I was thinking of other things .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . You think too much , dear . You remember what the great poet tells us . “ Do noble things , not dream them all day long . ” Tennyson , was n't it ? I know I wrote it in your album for you when you were a little girl . It 's so true .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Kingsley , Mother , not Tennyson .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p><stage>nodding</stage>Kingsley , that 's right .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Well , it 's the same thing . I know when my mother used to call me I used to come running up , saying , “ What is it , Mummy , darling ? ” And even if it was anything upstairs , like a handkerchief or a pair of socks to be mended , I used to trot off happily , saying to myself , “ Do noble things , not dream them all day long . ”</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>I am sorry , Mother . What is the noble thing you want doing ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Well now , you see , I 've forgotten . If only you 'd come at once , dear —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>I was looking out into the night . It 's a wonderful night . Midsummer Night .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Midsummer Night . And now I suppose the days will start drawing in , and we shall have winter upon us before we know where we are . All these changes of the seasons are very inconsiderate to an invalid . Ah , now I remember what I wanted , dear . Can you find me another cushion ? Dr. Anderson considers it most important that the small of the back should be well supported after a meal .<stage>Indicating the place</stage>Just here , dear .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p><stage>jumping up with the cushion from her chair</stage>Let me , Aunt Mary .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Thank you , Jane . Just here , please .<stage>JANE arranges it .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Is that right ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Thank you , dear . I only do it for Dr. Anderson 's sake .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>JANE goes back to her book and MELISANDE goes back to her Midsummer Night . There is silence for a little .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Oh , Sandy . . . Sandy !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Melisande !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>coming patiently down to them</stage>Yes , Mother ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Oh , Sandy , I 've just remembered —<stage>MELISANDE shudders .</stage>What is it , darling child ? Are you cold ? That comes of standing by the open window in a treacherous climate like this . Close the window and come and sit down properly .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>It 's a wonderful night , Mother . Midsummer Night . I 'm not cold .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . But you shuddered . I distinctly saw you shudder . Did n't you see her , Jane ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>I 'm afraid I was n't looking , Aunt Mary .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>I did n't shudder because I was cold . I shuddered because you will keep calling me by that horrible name . I shudder every time I hear it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE<stage>surprised</stage>What name , Sandy ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>There it is again . Oh , why did you christen me by such a wonderful , beautiful , magical name as Melisande , if you were going to call me Sandy ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Well , dear , as I think I 've told you , that was a mistake of your father 's . I suppose he got it out of some book . I should certainly never have agreed to it , if I had heard him distinctly . I thought he said Millicent — after your Aunt Milly . And not being very well at the time , and leaving it all to him , I never really knew about it until it was too late to do anything . I did say to your father , “ Ca n't we christen her again ? ” But there was nothing in the prayer book about it except “ riper years , ” and nobody seemed to know when riper years began . Besides , we were all calling you Sandy then . I think Sandy is a very pretty name , do n't you , Jane ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , but do n't you think Melisande is beautiful , Aunt Mary ? I mean really beautiful .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Well , it never seems to me quite respectable , not for a nicely-brought-up young girl in a Christian house . It makes me think of the sort of person who meets a strange young man to whom she has never been introduced , and talks to him in a forest with her hair coming down . They find her afterwards floating in a pool . Not at all the thing one wants for one 's daughter .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , but how thrilling it sounds !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Well , I think you are safer with “ Jane , ” dear . Your mother knew what she was about . And if I can save my only child from floating in a pool by calling her Sandy , I certainly think it is my duty to do so .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>to her self ecstatically</stage>Melisande !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE<stage>to MELISANDE</stage>Oh , and talking about floating in a pool reminds me about the bread-sauce at dinner to-night . You heard what your father said ? You must give cook a good talking to in the morning . She has been getting very careless lately . I do n't know what 's come over her .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>I 've come over her . When you were over her , everything was all right . You know all about housekeeping ; you take an interest in it . I do n't . I hate it . How can you expect the house to be run properly when they all know I hate it ? Why did you ever give it up and make me do it when you know how I hate it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Well , you must learn not to hate it . I 'm sure Jane here does n't hate it , and her mother is always telling me what a great help she is .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>warningly</stage>It 's no good your saying you like it , Jane , after what you told me yesterday .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>I do n't like it , but it does n't make me miserable doing it . But then I 'm different . I 'm not romantic like Melisande .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>One does n't need to be very romantic not to want to talk about bread-sauce . Bread-sauce on a night like this !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Well , I 'm only thinking of you , Sandy , not of myself . If I thought about myself I should disregard all the warnings that Dr. Anderson keeps giving me , and I should insist on doing the housekeeping just as I always used to . But I have to think of you . I want to see you married to some nice , steady young man before I die — my handkerchief , Jane —<stage>JANE gets up and gives her her handkerchief from the other end of the sofa</stage>— before I die<stage>she touches her eyes with her handkerchief</stage>, and no nice young man will want to marry you , if you have n't learnt how to look after his house for him .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>contemptuously</stage>If that 's marriage , I shall never get married .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p><stage>shocked</stage>Melisande , darling !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Dr. Anderson was saying , only yesterday , trying to make me more cheerful , “ Why , Mrs. Knowle , ” he said , “ you 'll live another hundred years yet . ” “ Dr. Anderson , ” I said , “ I do n't want to live another hundred years . I only want to live until my dear daughter , Melisande ” — I did n't say Sandy to him because it seemed rather familiar — “ I only want to live until my daughter Melisande is happily married to some nice , steady young man . Do this for me , Dr. Anderson , ” I said , “ and I shall be your lifelong debtor . ” He promised to do his best . It was then that he mentioned about the cushion in the small of the back after meals . And so do n't forget to tell cook about the bread-sauce , will you , dear ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>I will tell her , Mother .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . That 's right . I like a man to be interested in his food . I hope both your husbands , Sandy and Jane , will take a proper interest in what they eat . You will find that , after you have been married some years , and told each other everything you did and saw before you met , there is n't really anything to talk about at meals except food . And you must talk ; I hope you will both remember that . Nothing breaks up the home so quickly as silent meals . Of course , breakfast does n't matter , because he has his paper then ; and after you have said , “ Is there anything in the paper , dear ? ” and he has said , “ No , ” then he does n't expect anything more . I wonder sometimes why they go on printing the newspapers . I 've been married twenty years , and there has never been anything in the paper yet .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , Mother , I hate to hear you talking about marriage like that . Was n't there ever any kind of romance between you and Father ? Not even when he was wooing you ? Was n't there ever one magic Midsummer morning when you saw suddenly “ a livelier emerald twinkle in the grass , a purer sapphire melt into the sea ” ? Was n't there ever one passionate ecstatic moment when “ once he drew with one long kiss my whole soul through my lips , as sunlight drinketh dew ” ? Or did you talk about bread-sauce all the time ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p><stage>eagerly</stage>Tell us about it , Aunt Mary .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Well , dear , there is n't very much to tell . I am quite sure that we never drank dew together , or anything like that , as Sandy suggests , and it was n't by the sea at all , it was at Surbiton . He used to come down from London with his racquet and play tennis with us . And then he would stay on to supper sometimes , and then after supper we would go into the garden together — it was quite dark then , but everything smelt so beautifully , I shall always remember it — and we talked , oh , I do n't know what about , but I knew somehow that I should marry him one day . I do n't think he knew — he was n't sure — and then he came to a subscription dance one evening — I think Mother , your grandmother , guessed that that was to be my great evening , because she was very particular about my dress , and I remember she sent me upstairs again before we started , because I had n't got the right pair of shoes on — rather a tight pair — however , I put them on . And there was a hansom outside the hall , and it was our last dance together , and he said , “ Shall we sit it out , Miss Bagot ? ” Well , of course , I was only too glad to , and we sat it out in the hansom , driving all round Surbiton , and what your grandmother would have said I do n't know , but , of course , I never told her . And when we got home after the dance , I went up to her room — as soon as I 'd got my shoes off — and said , “ Mother , I have some wonderful news for you , ” and she said , “ Not Mr. Knowle — Henry ? ” and I said , “ ‘ M , ” rather bright-eyed you know , and wanting to cry . And she said , “ Oh , my darling child ! ” and — Jane , where 's my handkerchief ?<stage>It has dropped off the sofa and JANE picks it up</stage>Thank you , dear .<stage>She dabs her eyes</stage>Well , that 's really all , you know , except that —<stage>she dabs her eyes again</stage>— I 'm afraid I 'm feeling rather overcome . I 'm sure Dr. Anderson would say it was very bad for me to feel overcome . Your poor dear grandmother . Jane , dear , why did you ask me to tell you all this ? I must go away and compose myself before your uncle and Mr. Coote come in . I do n't know what I should do if Mr. Coote saw me like this .<stage>She begins to get up</stage>And after calling me a Spartan Mother only yesterday , because I said that if any nice , steady young man came along and took my own dear little girl away from me , I should bear the terrible wrench in silence rather than cause either of them a moment 's remorse .<stage>She is up now</stage>There !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Shall I come with you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . No , dear , not just now . Let me be by myself for a little .<stage>She turns back suddenly at the door</stage>Oh ! Perhaps later on , when the men come from the dining-room , dear Jane , you might join me , with your Uncle Henry — if the opportunity occurs . . . . But only if it occurs , of course .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>She goes .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p><stage>coming back to the sofa</stage>Poor Aunt Mary ! It always seems so queer that one 's mother and aunts and people should have had their romances too .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Do you call that romance , Jane ? Tennis and subscription dances and wearing tight shoes ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p><stage>awkwardly</stage>Well , no , darling , not romance of course , but you know what I mean .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Just think of the commonplace little story which mother has just told us , and compare it with any of the love-stories of history . Is n't it pitiful , Jane , that people should be satisfied now with so little ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , darling , very , very sad , but I do n't think Aunt Mary —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>I am not blaming Mother . It is the same almost everywhere nowadays . There is no romance left .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>No , darling . Of course , I am not romantic like you , but I do agree with you . It is very sad . Somehow there is no —<stage>she searches for the right word</stage>— no romance left .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Just think of the average marriage . It makes one shudder .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p><stage>doing her best</stage>Positively shudder !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>He meets Her at —<stage>she shudders</stage>— a subscription dance , or a tennis party —<stage>she shudders again</stage>or — at golf . He calls upon her mother — perhaps in a top hat — perhaps<stage>tragically</stage>even in a bowler hat .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>A bowler hat ! One shudders .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Her mother makes tactful inquiries about his income — discovers that he is a nice , steady young man — and decides that he shall marry her daughter . He is asked to come again , he is invited to parties ; it is understood that he is falling in love with the daughter . The rest of the family are encouraged to leave them alone together — if the opportunity occurs , Jane .<stage>Contemptuously</stage>But , of course , only if it occurs .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p><stage>awkwardly</stage>Yes , dear .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>One day he proposes to her .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p><stage>to herself ecstatically</stage>Oh !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>He stutters out a few unbeautiful words which she takes to be a proposal . She goes and tells Mother . He goes and tells Father . They are engaged . They talk about each other as “ my fiancé . ” Perhaps they are engaged for months and months —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Years and years sometimes , Melisande .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>For years and years — and wherever they go , people make silly little jokes about them , and cough very loudly if they go into a room where the two of them are . And then they get married at last , and everybody comes and watches them get married , and makes more silly jokes , and they go away for what they call a honeymoon , and they tell everybody — they shout it out in the newspapers — where they are going for their honeymoon ; and then they come back and start talking about bread-sauce . Oh , Jane , it 's horrible .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Horrible , darling .<stage>With a French air</stage>But what would you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>in a low thrilling voice</stage>What would I ? Ah , what would I , Jane ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Because you see , Sandy — I mean Melisande — you see , darling , this is the twentieth century , and —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Sometimes I see him clothed in mail , riding beneath my lattice window . All in the blue unclouded weather Thick-jewelled shone the saddle leather , The helmet and the helmet feather Burned like one burning flame together , As he rode down to Camelot . And from his blazoned baldric slung A mighty silver bugle hung , And as he rode his armour rung As he rode down to Camelot .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>I know , dear . But of course they do n't nowadays .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>And as he rides beneath my room , singing to himself , I wave one lily hand to him from my lattice , and toss him down a gage , a gage for him to wear in his helm , a rose — perhaps just a rose .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p><stage>awed</stage>No , Melisande , would you really ? Wave a lily hand to him ?<stage>She waves one</stage>I mean , would n't it be rather — you know . Rather forward .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Forward !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p><stage>upset</stage>Well , I mean — Well , of course , I suppose it was different in those days .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>How else could he know that I loved him ? How else could he wear my gage in his helm when he rode to battle ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Well , of course , there is that .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>And then when he has slain his enemies in battle , he comes back to me . I knot my sheets together so as to form a rope — for I have been immured in my room — and I let myself down to him . He places me on the saddle in front of him , and we ride forth together into the world — together for always !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p><stage>a little uncomfortably</stage>You do get married , I suppose , darling , or do you — er —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>We stop at a little hermitage on the way , and a good priest marries us .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p><stage>relieved .</stage>Ah , yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>And sometimes he is not in armour . He is a prince from Fairyland . My father is king of a neighbouring country , a country which is sorely troubled by a dragon .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>By a what , dear ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>A dragon .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , yes , of course .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>The king , my father , offers my hand and half his kingdom to anybody who will slay the monster . A prince who happens to be passing through the country essays the adventure . Alas , the dragon devours him .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , Melisande , that is n't the one ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>My eyes have barely rested upon him . He has aroused no emotion in my heart .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , I 'm so glad .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Another prince steps forward . Impetuously he rushes upon the fiery monster . Alas , he likewise is consumed .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p><stage>sympathetically .</stage>Poor fellow</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>And then one evening a beautiful and modest youth in blue and gold appears at my father 's court , and begs that he too be allowed to try his fortune with the dragon . Passing through the great hall on my way to my bed-chamber , I see him suddenly . Our eyes meet . . . . Oh , Jane !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Darling ! . . . You ought to have lived in those days , Melisande . They would have suited you so well .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Will they never come back again ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Well , I do n't quite see how they can . People do n't dress in blue and gold nowadays . I mean men .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>No .<stage>She sighs</stage>Well , I suppose I shall never marry .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Of course , I 'm not romantic like you , darling , and I do n't have time to read all the wonderful books you read , and though I quite agree with everything you say , and of course it must have been thrilling to have lived in those wonderful old days , still here we are , and<stage>with a wave of the hand</stage>— and what I mean is — here we are .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>You are content to put romance out of your life , and to make the ordinary commonplace marriage ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>What I mean is , that it would n't be commonplace if it was the right man . Some nice , clean-looking Englishman — I do n't say beautiful — pleasant , and good at games , dependable , not very clever perhaps , but making enough money ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>carelessly</stage>It sounds rather like Bobby .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p><stage>confused</stage>It is n't like Bobby , or any one else particularly . It 's just anybody . It was n't any particular person . I was just describing the sort of man without thinking of any one in ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>All right , dear , all right .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Besides , we all know Bobby 's devoted to you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>firmly</stage>Now , look here , Jane , I warn you solemnly that if you think you are going to leave me and Bobby alone together this evening ——<stage>Voices are heard outside .</stage>Well , I warn you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p><stage>in a whisper</stage>Of course not , darling .<stage>With perfect tact</stage>And , as I was saying , Melisande , it was quite the most —— Ah , here you are at last ! We wondered what had happened to you !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>Enter BOBBY and MR. KNOWLE . JANE has already described BOBBY for us . MR. KNOWLE is a pleasant , middle-aged man with a sense of humour , which he cultivates for his own amusement entirely .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>Were you very miserable without us ?<stage>He goes towards them .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p><stage>laughing</stage>Very .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MELISANDE gets up as BOBBY comes , and moves away .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Where 's your Mother , Sandy ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>In the dining-room , I think , Father .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Ah ! Resting , no doubt . By the way , you wo n't forget what I said about the bread-sauce , will you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>You do n't want it remembered , Father , do you ? What you said ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Not the actual words . All I want , my dear , is that you should endeavour to explain to the cook the difference between bread-sauce and a bread-poultice . Make it clear to her that there is no need to provide a bread-poultice with an obviously healthy chicken , such as we had to-night , but that a properly made bread-sauce is a necessity , if the full flavour of the bird is to be obtained .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>“ Full flavour of the bird is to be obtained . ” Yes , Father .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . That 's right , my dear . Bring it home to her . A little quiet talk will do wonders . Well , and so it 's Midsummer Night . Why are n't you two out in the garden looking for fairies ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>I say , it 's a topping night , you know . We ought to be out . D'you feel like a stroll , Sandy ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>No , thank you , Bobby , I do n't think I 'll go out .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>Oh , I say , it 's awfully warm .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>KNOWLE . Well , Jane , I shall take you out . If we meet any of</l>
        <l>Sandy 's fairy friends , you can introduce me .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking across warningly at her</stage>Jane ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p><stage>awkwardly</stage>I 'm afraid , Uncle Henry , that Melisande and I — I promised Sandy — we ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE<stage>putting her arm firmly through his</stage>Nonsense . I 'm not going to have my niece taken away from me , when she is only staying with us for such a short time . Besides I insist upon being introduced to Titania . I want to complain about the rings on the tennis-lawn . They must dance somewhere else .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking anxiously at MELISANDE</stage>You see , Uncle Henry , I 'm not feeling very ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>resigned</stage>All right , Jane .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p><stage>brightly</stage>All right , Uncle Henry .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE<stage>very brightly</stage>It 's all right , Bobby .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Come along !<stage>They go to the open windows together .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE<stage>as they go</stage>Any message for Oberon , if we meet him ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>gravely</stage>No , thank you , Father .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . It 's his turn to write , I suppose .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>JANE laughs as they go out together .</stage>
      <stage>Left alone , MELISANDE takes up a book and goes to the sofa with it , while BOBBY walks about the room unhappily , whistling to himself . He keeps looking across at her , and at last their eyes meet .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>putting down her book</stage>Well , Bobby ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p><stage>awkwardly</stage>Well , Sandy ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>angrily</stage>Do n't call me that ; you know how I hate it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>Sorry . Melisande . But it 's such a dashed mouthful . And your father was calling you Sandy just now , and you did n't say anything .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>One cannot always control one 's parents . There comes a time when it is almost useless to say things to them .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p><stage>eagerly</stage>I never mind your saying things to me , Sandy — I mean , Melisande . I never shall mind , really I sha n't . Of course , I know I 'm not worthy of you , and all that , but — I say , Melisande , is n't there any hope ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Bobby , I asked you not to talk to me like that again .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p><stage>coming to her</stage>I know you did , but I must . I can n't believe that you —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>I told you that , if you promised not to talk like that again , then I would n't tell anybody anything about it , so that it should n't be awkward for you . And I have n't told anybody , not even Jane , to whom I tell all my secrets . Most men , when they propose to a girl , and she refuses them , have to go right out of the country and shoot lions ; it 's the only thing left for them to do . But I did try and make it easy for you , Bobby .<stage>Sadly</stage>And now you 're beginning all over again .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p><stage>awkwardly</stage>I though perhaps you might have changed your mind . Lots of girls do .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>contemptuously</stage>Lots of girls ! Is that how you think of me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>Well , your mother said —<stage>He breaks off hurriedly .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>coldly</stage>Have you been discussing me with my mother ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>I say , Sandy , do n't be angry . Sorry ; I mean Melisande .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Do n't apologise . Go on .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>Well , I did n't discuss you with your mother . She just happened to say that girls never knew their own minds , and that they always said “ No ” the first time , and that I need n't be downhearted , because —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>That you need n't ? You mean you told her ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>Well , it sort of came out .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>After I had promised that I would n't say anything , you went and told her ! And then I suppose you went and told the cook , and she said that her brother 's young woman was just the same , and then you told the butcher , and he said , “ You stick to it , sir . All women are alike . My missis said ‘ No ’ to me the first time . ” And then you went and told the gardeners — I suppose you had all the gardeners together in the potting-shed , and gave them a lecture about it — and when you had told them , you said , “ Excuse me a moment , I must now go and tell the postman , ” and then —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>I say , steady ; you know that is n't fair .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , what a world !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>I say , you know that is n't fair .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>picking up her book</stage>Father and Jane are outside , Bobby , if you have anything you wish to tell them . But I suppose they know already .<stage>She pretends to read .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>I say , you know —<stage>He does n't quite know what to say . There is an awkward silence . Then he says humbly</stage>I 'm awfully sorry , Melisande . Please forgive me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking at him gravely</stage>That 's nice of you , Bobby . Please forgive me . I was n't fair .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>I swear I never said anything to anybody else , only your mother . And it sort of came out with her . She began talking about you —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>I know .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>But I never told anybody else .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>It would n't be necessary if you told Mother .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>I 'm awfully sorry , but I really do n't see why you should mind so much . I mean , I know I 'm not anybody very much , but I can n't help falling in love with you , and — well , it is a sort of a compliment to you , is n't it ?— even if it 's only me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Of course it is , Bobby , and I do thank you for the compliment . But mixing Mother up in it makes it all so — so unromantic .<stage>After a pause</stage>Sometimes I think I shall never marry .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>Oh , rot ! . . . I say , you do like me , do n't you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Oh yes . You are a nice , clean-looking Englishman — I do n't say beautiful —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>I should hope not !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Pleasant , good at games , dependable — not very clever , perhaps , but making enough money —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>Well , I mean , that 's not so bad .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , but I want so much more !</p>
      </sp>

       <p>What sort of things ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , Bobby , you 're so — so ordinary !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>Well , dash it all , you did n't want me to be a freak , did you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>So — commonplace . So — unromantic .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>I say , steady on ! I do n't say I 'm always reading poetry and all that , if that 's what you mean by romantic , but — commonplace ! I 'm blessed if I see how you make out that .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Bobby , I do n't want to hurt your feelings —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>Go on , never mind my feelings .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Well then , look at yourself in the glass !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>BOBBY goes anxiously to the glass , and then pulls at his clothes .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking back at her</stage>Well ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Well !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>I do n't see what 's wrong .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , Bobby , everything 's wrong . The man to whom I give myself must be not only my lover , but my true knight , my hero , my prince . He must perform deeds of derring-do to win my love . Oh , how can you perform deeds of derring-do in a stupid little suit like that !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking at it</stage>What 's the matter with it ? It 's what every other fellow wears .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>contemptuously</stage>What every other fellow wears ! And you think what every other fellow thinks , and talk what every other fellow talks , and eat what every other — I suppose you did n't like the bread-sauce this evening ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p><stage>guardedly</stage>Well , not as bread-sauce .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>nodding her head</stage>I thought so , I thought so .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p><stage>struck by an idea</stage>I say , you did n't make it , did you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Do I look as if I made it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>I thought perhaps — You know , I really do n't know what you do want , Sandy . Sorry ; I mean —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Go on calling me Sandy , I 'd rather you did .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>Well , when you marry this prince of yours , is he going to do the cooking ? I do n't understand you , Sandy , really I do n't .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>shaking her head gently at him</stage>No , I 'm sure you do n't , Bobby .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p><stage>still trying , however</stage>I suppose it 's because he 's doing the cooking that he wo n't be able to dress for dinner . He sounds a funny sort of chap ; I should like to see him .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>You would n't understand him if you did see him .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p><stage>jealously</stage>Have you seen him ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Only in my dreams .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p><stage>relieved</stage>Oh , well .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>dreamily to herself</stage>Perhaps I shall never see him in this world — and then I shall never marry . But if he ever comes for me , he will come not like other men ; and because he is so different from everybody else , then I shall know him when he comes for me . He wo n't talk about bread-sauce — billiards — and the money market . He wo n't wear a little black suit , with a little black tie — all sideways .<stage>BOBBY hastily pulls his tie straight .</stage>I do n't know how he will be dressed , but I know this , that when I see him , that when my eyes have looked into his , when his eyes have looked into mine —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>I say , steady !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>waking from her dream</stage>Yes ?<stage>She gives a little laugh</stage>Poor Bobby !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p><stage>appealingly</stage>I say , Sandy !<stage>He goes up to her .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MRS. KNOWLE has seized this moment to come back for her handkerchief . She sees them together , and begins to walk out on tiptoe .</stage>
      <stage>They hear her and turn round suddenly .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE<stage>in a whisper</stage>Do n't take any notice of me . I only just came for my handkerchief .<stage>She continues to walk on tiptoe towards the opposite door .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>getting up</stage>We were just wondering where you were , Mother . Here 's your handkerchief .<stage>She picks it up from the sofa .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE<stage>still in the voice in which you speak to an invalid</stage>Thank you , dear . Do n't let me interrupt you — I was just going —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>But I am just going into the garden . Stay and talk to</l>
        <l>Bobby , wo n't you ?</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE<stage>with a happy smile , hoping for the best</stage>Yes , my darling .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>going to the windows</stage>That 's right .<stage>She stops at the windows and holds out her hands to the night</stage>— The moon shines bright : In such a night as this When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees And they did make no noise , in such a night Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls , And sighed his soul towards the Grecian tents , Where Cressid lay that night . In such a night Stood Dido with a willow in her hand , Upon the wild sea banks , and waft her love To come again to Carthage .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>She stays there a moment , and then says in a thrilling voice ) In such a night ! Ah !</stage>
      <stage>She goes to it .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE<stage>in a different voice</stage>Ah ! . . . Well , Mr. Coote ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p><stage>turning back to her with a start</stage>Oh — er — yes ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . No , I think I must call you Bobby . I may call you Bobby , may n't I ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>Oh , please do , Mrs. Knowle .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE<stage>archly</stage>Not Mrs. Knowle ! Ca n't you think of a better name ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p><stage>wondering if he ought to call her MARY</stage>Er — I 'm — I 'm afraid I do n't quite —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Mother .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>Oh , but I say —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE<stage>giving him her hand</stage>And now come and sit on the sofa with me , and tell me all about it .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>They go to the sofa together .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>But I say , Mrs. Knowle —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>KNOWLE</l>
        <stage>shaking a finger playfully at him</stage>
        <l>Not Mrs. Knowle ,</l>
        <l>Bobby .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>But I say , you must n't think — I mean Sandy and I — we are n't —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . You do n't mean to tell me , Mr. Coote , that she has refused you again .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>Yes . I say , I 'd much rather not talk about it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Well , it just shows you that what I said the other day was true . Girls do n't know their own minds .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p><stage>ruefully</stage>I think Sandy knows hers — about me , anyhow .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Mr. Coote , you are forgetting what the poet said — Shakespeare , or was it the other man ?— “ Faint heart never won fair lady . ” If Mr. Knowle had had a faint heart , he would never have won me . Seven times I refused him , and seven times he came again — like Jacob . The eighth time he drew out a revolver , and threatened to shoot himself . I was shaking like an aspen leaf . Suddenly I realised that I loved him . “ Henry , ” I said , “ I am yours . ” He took me in his arms — putting down the revolver first , of course . I have never regretted my surrender , Mr. Coote .<stage>With a sigh</stage>Ah , me ! We women are strange creatures .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>I do n't believe Sandy would mind if I did shoot myself .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Oh , do n't say that , Mr. Coote . She is very warm-hearted . I 'm sure it would upset her a good deal . Oh no , you are taking too gloomy a view of the situation , I am sure of it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>Well , I sha n't shoot myself , but I sha n't propose to her again . I know when I 'm not wanted .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . But we do want you , Mr. Coote . Both my husband and I —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>I say , I 'd much rather not talk about it , if you do n't mind . I practically promised her that I would n't say anything to you this time .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>KNOWLE . What , not say anything to her only mother ? But how should</l>
        <l>I know if I were to call you “ Bobby , ” or not ?</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>Well , of course — I mean I have n't really said anything , have I ? Nothing she 'd really mind . She 's so funny about things .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . She is indeed , Mr. Coote . I do n't know where she gets it from . Neither Henry nor I are in the least funny . It was all the result of being christened in that irreligious way — I quite thought he said Millicent — and reading all those books , instead of visiting the sick as I used to do . I was quite a little Red Riding Hood until Henry sprang at me so fiercely .<stage>MR. KNOWLE and JANE come in by the window , and she turns round towards them .</stage>Ah , there you both are . I was wondering where you had got to . Mr. Coote has been telling me all about his prospects in the city . So comforting . Jane , you did n't get your feet wet , I hope .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>It 's quite dry , Aunt Mary .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . It 's a most beautiful night , my dear . We 've been talking to the fairies — have n't we , Jane ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Well , as long as you did n't get cold . Did you see Sandy ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . We did n't see any one but Titania — and Peters . He had an appointment , apparently — but not with Titania .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>He is walking out with Alice , I think .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Well , Melisande will have to talk to Alice in the morning . I always warned you , Henry , about the danger of having an unmarried chauffeur on the premises . I always felt it was a mistake .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Apparently , my dear , Peters feels as strongly about it as you . He is doing his best to remedy the error .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE<stage>getting up</stage>Well , I must be going to bed . I have been through a good deal to-night ; more than any of you know about .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE<stage>cheerfully</stage>What 's the matter , my love ? Indigestion ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Beyond saying that it is not indigestion , Henry , my lips are sealed . I shall suffer my cross — my mental cross — in silence .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Shall I come with you , Aunt Mary ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . In five minutes , dear .<stage>To Heaven</stage>My only daughter has left me , and gone into the night . Fortunately my niece has offered to help me out of my — to help me .<stage>Holding out her hand</stage>Good-night , Mr. Coote .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>Good-night , Mrs. Knowle .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>KNOWLE . Good-night ! And remember</l>
        <stage>in a loud whisper</stage>
        <l>what</l>
        <l>Shakespeare said .</l>
        <stage>She presses his hand and holds it</stage>
        <l>Good-night !</l>
        <l>Good-night ! . . . Good-night !</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Shakespeare said so many things . Among others , he said , “ Good-night , good-night , parting is such sweet sorrow , that I could say good-night till it be morrow . ”<stage>MRS. KNOWLE looks at him severely , and then , without saying anything , goes over to him and holds up her cheek .</stage>Good-night , my dear . Sleep well .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . In five minutes , Jane .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , Aunt Mary .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MRS. KNOWLE goes to the door , BOBBY hurrying in front to open it for her .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE<stage>at the door</stage>I shall not sleep well . I shall lie awake all night . Dr. Anderson will be very much distressed . “ Dr. Anderson , ” I shall say , “ it is not your fault . I lay awake all night , thinking of my loved ones . ” In five minutes , Jane .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>She goes out .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . An exacting programme . Well , I shall be in the library , if anybody wants to think of me — or say good-night to me — or anything like that .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Then I 'd better say good-night to you now , Uncle Henry .<stage>She goes up to him .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE<stage>kissing her</stage>Good-night , dear .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Good-night .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . If there 's anybody else who wants to kiss me — what about you , Bobby ? Or will you come into the library and have a smoke first ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>Oh , I shall be going to bed directly , I think . Rather tired to-day , somehow .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p><stage>He goes out .</stage>KNOWLE . Then good-night to you also . Dear me , what a business this is . Sandy has left us for ever , I understand . If she should come back , Jane , and wishes to kiss the top of my head , she will find it in the library — just above the back of the armchair nearest the door .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Did Sandy go out into the garden ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p><stage>gloomily</stage>Yes — about five minutes ago .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p><stage>timidly</stage>I 'm so sorry , Bobby .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>Thanks , it 's awfully decent of you .<stage>After a pause</stage>Do n't let 's talk about it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Of course I wo n't if it hurts you , Bobby . But I felt I had to say something , I felt so sorry . You did n't mind , did you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>It 's awfully decent of you to mind .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p><stage>gently</stage>I mind very much when my friends are unhappy .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>Thanks awfully .<stage>He stands up , buttons his coat , and looks at himself</stage>I say , do you see anything wrong with it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Wrong with what ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>My clothes .<stage>He revolves slowly .</stage></p>

       <p>Of course not . They fit beautifully .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>Sandy 's so funny about things . I do n't know what she means half the time .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Of course , I 'm very fond of Melisande , but I do see what you mean . She 's so<stage>searching for the right word</stage>— so romantic .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p><stage>eagerly</stage>Yes , that 's just it . It takes a bit of living up to . I say , have a cigarette , wo n't you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>No , thank you . Of course , I 'm very fond of Melisande , but I do feel sometimes that I do n't altogether envy the man who marries her .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>I say , do you really feel that ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Yes . She 's too<stage>getting the right word at last</stage>— too romantic .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>You 're about right , you know . I mean she talks about doing deeds of derring-do . Well , I mean that 's all very well , but when one marries and settles down — you know what I mean ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Exactly . That 's just how I feel about it . As I said to Melisande only this evening , this is the twentieth century . Well , I happen to like the twentieth century . That 's all .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>I see what you mean .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>It may be very unromantic of me , but I like men to be keen on games , and to wear the clothes that everybody else wears — as long as they fit well , of course — and to talk about the ordinary things that everybody talks about . Of course , Melisande would say that that was very stupid and unromantic of me ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>I do n't think it is at all .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>How awfully nice of you to say that , Bobby . You do understand so wonderfully .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p><stage>with a laugh</stage>I say , that 's rather funny . I was just thinking the same about you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>I say , were you really ? I 'm so glad . I like to feel that we are really friends , and that we understand each other . I do n't know whether I 'm different from other girls , but I do n't make friends very easily .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>Do you mean men or women friends ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Both . In fact , but for Melisande and you , I can hardly think of any — not what you call real friends .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>Melisande is a great friend , is n't she ? You tell each other all your secrets , and that sort of thing , do n't you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , we 're great friends , but there are some things that I could never tell even her .<stage>Impressively</stage>I could never show her my inmost heart .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>I do n't believe about your not having any men friends . I bet there are hundreds of them , as keen on you as anything .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>I wonder . It would be rather nice to think there were . That sounds horrid , does n't it , but a girl can n't help wanting to be liked .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>Of course she can n't ; nobody can . I do n't think it 's a bit horrid .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>How nice of you .<stage>She gets up</stage>Well , I must be going , I suppose .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>What 's the hurry ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Aunt Mary . She said five minutes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>And how long will you be with her ? You 'll come down again , wo n't you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>No , I do n't think so . I 'm rather tired this evening .<stage>Holding out her hand</stage>Good-night , Bobby .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p><stage>taking it</stage>Oh , but look here , I 'll come and light your candle for you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>How nice of you !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>She manages to get her hand back , and they walk to the door together .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>I suppose I may as well go to bed myself .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p><stage>at the door</stage>Well , if you are , we 'd better put the lights out .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>Righto .<stage>He puts them out .</stage>I say , what a night !<stage>The moonlight streams through the windows on them .</stage>You 'll hardly want a candle .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>They go out together .</stage>
      <stage>The hall is empty . Suddenly the front door bell is heard to ring . After a little interval , ALICE comes in , turns on the light , and looks round the hall . She is walking across the hall to the drawing-room when MR. KNOWLE comes in from behind her , and she turns round .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Were you looking for me , Alice ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ALICE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , sir . There 's a gentleman at the front door , sir .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Rather late for a call , is n't it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ALICE</speaker>
       <p>He 's in a motor car , sir , and it 's broken down , and he wondered if you 'd lend him a little petrol . He told me to say how very sorry he was to trouble you ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . But he 's not troubling me at all — particularly if Peters is about . I daresay you could find Peters , Alice , and if it 's not troubling Peters too much , perhaps he would see to it . And ask the gentleman to come in . We can n't keep him standing on the door-mat .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ALICE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , sir . I did ask him before , sir .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Well , ask him this time in the voice of one who is about to bring in the whiskey .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ALICE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , sir .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . And then — bring in the whiskey .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ALICE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , sir .<stage>She goes out , and returns a moment later</stage>He says , thank you very much , sir , but he really wo n't come in , and he 's very sorry indeed to trouble you about the petrol .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Ah ! I 'm afraid we were too allusive for him .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ALICE</speaker>
       <p><stage>hopefully</stage>Yes , sir .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Well , we wo n't be quite so subtle this time . Present Mr. Knowle 's compliments , and say that I shall be very much honoured if he will drink a glass of whiskey with me before proceeding on his journey .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ALICE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , sir .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . And then — bring in the whiskey .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ALICE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , sir .<stage>She goes out . In a little while she comes back followed by the stranger , who is dressed from head to foot in a long cloak .</stage>Mr. Gervase Mallory .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>She goes out .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . How do you do , Mr. Mallory ? I 'm very glad to see you .<stage>They shake hands .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>It 's very kind of you . I really must apologise for bothering you like this . I 'm afraid I 'm being an awful nuisance .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Not at all . Are you going far ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Collingham . I live at Little Malling , about twenty miles away . Do you know it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Yes . I 've been through it . I did n't know it was as far away as that .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p><stage>with a laugh</stage>Well , perhaps only by the way I came . The fact is I 've lost myself rather .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . I 'm afraid you have . Collingham . You ought n't to have come within five miles of us .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>I suppose I ought n't .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Well , all the more reason for having a drink now that you are here .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>It 's awfully kind of you .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>ALICE comes in .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Ah , here we are .<stage>ALICE puts down the whiskey .</stage>You 've told Peters ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ALICE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , sir . He 's looking after it now .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . That 's right ,<stage>ALICE goes out .</stage>You 'll have some whiskey , wo n't you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Thanks very much .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>He comes to the table .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . And do take your coat off , wo n't you , and make yourself comfortable ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Er — thanks . I do n't think ——<stage>He smiles to himself and keeps his cloak on .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE<stage>busy with the drinks</stage>Say when .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Thank you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . And soda ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Please . . . . Thanks !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>He takes the glass .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE<stage>giving himself one</stage>I 'm so glad you came , because I have a horror of drinking alone . Even when my wife gives me cough-mixture , I insist on somebody else in the house having cough-mixture too . A glass of cough-mixture with an old friend just before going to bed ——<stage>He looks up</stage>But do take your coat off , wo n't you , and sit down and be comfortable ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Er — thanks very much , but I do n't think ——<stage>With a shrug and a smile</stage>Oh , well !<stage>He puts down his glass and begins to take it off . He is in fancy dress — the wonderful young Prince in blue and gold of MELISANDE 'S dream .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <stage>MR. KNOWLE turns round to him again just as he has put his cloak down . He looks at GERVASE in amazement .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE<stage>pointing to his whiskey glass</stage>But I have n't even begun it yet . . . . Perhaps it 's the port .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p><stage>laughing</stage>I 'm awfully sorry . You must wonder what on earth I 'm doing .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . No , no ; I wondered what on earth I 'd been doing .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>You see , I 'm going to a fancy dress dance at Collingham .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . You relieve my mind considerably .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>That 's why I did n't want to come in — or take my cloak off .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE<stage>inspecting him</stage>It becomes you extraordinarily well , if I may say so .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , thanks very much . But one feels rather absurd in it when other people are in ordinary clothes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . On the contrary , you make other people feel absurd . I do n't know that that particular style would have suited me , but<stage>looking at himself</stage>I am sure that I could have found something more expressive of my emotions than this .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>You 're quite right . “ Dress does make a difference , Davy . ”</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . It does indeed .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>I feel it 's almost wicked of me to be drinking a whiskey and soda .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Very wicked .<stage>Taking out his case</stage>Have a cigarette , too ?</p>

       <p>May I have one of my own ?</p>

       <p>KNOWLE . Match ?</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Well , now about Collingham . I do n't know if you saw a map outside in the hall .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>I saw it , but I am afraid I did n't look at it . I was too much interested in your prints .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE<stage>eagerly</stage>You do n't say that you are interested in prints ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Very much — as an entire amateur .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Most of the young men who come here think that the art began and ended with Kirchner . If you are really interested , I have something in the library — but of course I must n't take up your time now . If you could bear to come over another day — after all , we are neighbours ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>It 's awfully nice of you ; I should love it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Hedgling is the name of the village . I mention it because you seem to have lost your way so completely ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , by Jove , now I know where I am . It 's so different in the moonlight . I 'm lunching this way to-morrow . Might I come on afterwards ? And then I can return your petrol , thank you for your hospitality , and expose my complete ignorance of old prints , all in one afternoon .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Well , but you must come anyhow . Come to tea .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>That will be ripping .<stage>Getting up</stage>Well , I suppose I ought to be getting on .<stage>He picks up his cloak .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . We might just have a look at that map on the way .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Oh yes , do let 's .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>They go to the door together , and stand for a moment looking at the casement windows .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . It really is a wonderful night .<stage>He switches off the lights , and the moon streams through the windows</stage>Just look .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p><stage>with a deep sigh</stage>Wonderful !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>They go out together .</stage>
      <stage>The hall is empty for a moment . Then GERVASE reappears . He has forgotten his cigarette-case . He finds it , and on his way out again stops for a moment in the moonlight , looking through the casement windows .</stage>
      <stage>MELISANDE comes in by the French windows . He hears her , and at the same moment she sees him . She gives a little wondering cry . It is He ! The knight of her dreams .

      <stage>It is seven o'clock on a beautiful midsummer morning . The scene is a glade in a wood a little way above the village of Hedgling .</stage>

       <speaker>GERVASE MALLORY</speaker>
       <p>, still in his fancy dress , but with his cloak on , comes in . He looks round him and says , “ By Jove , how jolly ! ” He takes off his cloak , throws it down , stretches himself , turns round , and , seeing the view behind him , goes to look at it . While he is looking he hears an unmelodious whistling . He turns round with a start ; the whistling goes on ; he says “ Good Lord ! ” and tries to get to his cloak . It is too late . ERN , a very small boy , comes through the trees into the glade . GERVASE gives a sigh of resignation and stands there . ERN stops in the middle of his tune and gazes at him .</p>

       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>I quite agree with you .</p>

       <speaker>ERN</speaker>
       <p>Oo ! Look !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , it is a bit dressy , is n't it ? Come round to the back — take a good look at it while you can . That 's right . . . . Been all round ? Good !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ERN</speaker>
       <p>Oo !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>You keep saying “ Oo . ” It makes conversation very difficult . Do you mind if I sit down ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ERN</speaker>
       <p>Oo !</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Really , I do n't understand you . I came up here for a walk in a perfectly ordinary blue suit , and you do nothing but say “ Oo . ” What does your father wear when he 's ploughing ? I suppose you do n't walk all round him and say “ Oo ! ” What does your Uncle George wear when he 's reaping ? I suppose you do n't — By the way , I wish you 'd tell me your name .<stage>ERN gazes at him dumbly .</stage>Oh , come ! They must have told you your name when you got up this moving .</p>

       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Mallory . We can n't keep on saying this to each other , you know , because then we never get any farther . Once an introduction is over , Mr. Hearne , we are —</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>ERN</speaker>
       <p>Ern .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , I know . I was very glad to hear it . But now — Oh , I see what you mean . Ern — short for Ernest ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ERN</speaker>
       <p><stage>nodding</stage>They calls me Ern .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>That 's very friendly of them . Being more of a stranger I shall call you Ernest . Well , Ernest —<stage>getting up</stage>Just excuse me a moment , will you ? Very penetrating bark this tree has . It must be a Pomeranian .<stage>He folds his cloak upon it and sits down again</stage>That 's better . Now we can talk comfortably together . I do n't know if there 's anything you particularly want to discuss — nothing ?— well , then , I will suggest the subject of breakfast .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>You 've had yours ? You selfish brute ! . . . Of course , you 're wondering why I have n't had mine .</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Do n't keep on going through all the courses . Well , what happened was this . My car broke down . I suppose you never had a motor car of your own .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ERN</speaker>
       <p>Do n't like moty cars .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Well , really , after last night I 'm inclined to agree with you . Well , no , I ought n't to say that , because , if I had n't broken down , I should never have seen Her . Ernest , I do n't know if you 're married or anything of that sort , but I think even your rough stern heart would have been moved by that vision of loveliness which I saw last night .<stage>He is silent for a little , thinking of her .</stage>Well , then , I lost my way . There I was — ten miles from anywhere — in the middle of what was supposed to be a short cut — late at night — Midsummer Night — what would you have done , Ernest ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ERN</speaker>
       <p>Gone ‘ ome .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Do n't be silly . How could I go home when I did n't know where home was , and it was a hundred miles away , and I 'd just seen the Princess ? No , I did what your father or your Uncle George or any wise man would have done , I sat in the car and thought of Her .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ERN</speaker>
       <p>Oo !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>You are surprised ? Ah , but if you 'd seen her . . . . Have you ever been alone in the moonlight on Midsummer Night — I do n't mean just for a minute or two , but all through the night until the dawn came ? You are n't really alone , you know . All round you there are little whisperings going on , little breathings , little rustlings . Somebody is out hunting ; somebody stirs in his sleep as he dreams again the hunt of yesterday ; somebody up in the tree-tops pipes suddenly to the dawn , and then , finding that the dawn has not come , puts his silly little head back under his wing and goes to sleep again . . . . And the fairies are out . Do you believe in fairies , Ernest ? You would have believed in them last night . I heard them whispering .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ERN</speaker>
       <p>Oo !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p><stage>coming out of his thoughts with a laugh</stage>Well , of course , I can n't expect you to believe me . But do n't go about thinking that there 's nothing in the world but bacon fat and bull'shYpppHeNeyes . Well , then , I suppose I went to sleep , for I woke up suddenly and it was morning , the most wonderful sparkling magical morning — but , of course , you were just settling down to business then .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ERN</speaker>
       <p>Oo !<stage>He makes more reminiscent noises .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , that 's just what I said . I said to myself , breakfast .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ERN</speaker>
       <p>‘ Ad my breakfast .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , but I ‘ ad n't . I said to myself , “ Surely my old friend , Ernest , whom I used to shoot bison with in the Himalayas , has got an estate somewhere in these parts . I will go and share his simple meal with him . ” So I got out of the car , and I did what you did n't do , young man , I had a bathe in the river , and then a dry on a pocket-handkerchief — one of my sister 's , unfortunately — and then I came out to look for breakfast . And suddenly , whom should I meet but my old friend , Ernest , the same hearty fellow , the same inveterate talker as when we shot dragon-flies together in the swamps of Malay .<stage>Shaking his hand</stage>Ernest , old boy , pleased to meet you . What about it ?</p>

       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>S'sh .<stage>He gets up</stage>Now then — to business . Do you mind looking the other way while I try to find my purse .<stage>Feeling for it .</stage>Every morning when you get up , you should say , “ Thank God , I 'm getting a big boy now and I 've got pockets in my trousers . ” And you should feel very sorry for the poor people who lived in fairy books and had no trousers to put pockets in . Ah , here we are . Now then , Ernest , attend very carefully . Where do you live ?</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Good . Now then , I want you to take this —<stage>giving him half-a-crown</stage>—</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>ERN</speaker>
       <p>Oo !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , I thought that would move you — and I want you to ask your mother if you can bring me some breakfast up here . Now , listen very carefully , because we are coming to the important part . Hard-boiled eggs , bread , butter , and a bottle of milk — and anything else she likes . Tell her that it 's most important , because your old friend Mallory whom you shot white mice with in Egypt is starving by the roadside . And if you come back here with a basket quickly , I 'll give you as many bull'shYpppHeNeyes as you can eat in a week .<stage>Very earnestly</stage>Now , Ernest , with all the passion and emotion of which I am capable before breakfast , I ask you : have you got that ?</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Going ‘ ome . Yes . But — returning with breakfast . Starving man — lost in forest — return with basket — save life .<stage>To himself</stage>I believe I could explain it better to a Chinaman .<stage>to ERN</stage>Now then , off you go .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , and I wonder if I shall get mine .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>GERVASE walks slowly after him and stands looking at him as he goes down the hill . Then , turning round , he sees another stranger in the distance .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Hullo , here 's another of them .<stage>He walks towards the log</stage>Horribly crowded the country 's getting nowadays .<stage>He puts on his coat .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <stage>A moment later a travelling Peddler , name of SUSAN , comes in singing . He sees GERVASE sitting on the log .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p><stage>with a bow</stage>Good morning , sir .</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>I had thought to be alone . I trust my singing did not discommode you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Not at all . I like it . Do go on .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>Alas , the song ends there .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , well , could n't we have it again ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>Perhaps later , sir , if you insist .<stage>Taking off his hat</stage>Would it inconvenience you if I rested here for a few minutes ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Not a bit . It 's a jolly place to rest at , is n't it ? Have you come far this morning ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>Three or four miles — a mere nothing on a morning like this . Besides , what does the great William say ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>I do n't think I know him . What does he say ?</p>

       <p>Give me health and a day , and I will make the pomp of Empires ridiculous .</p>

       <p>Not a poet , too ?</p>

       <p>But one with the poets in spirit — like myself . I am very glad to meet you , Mr. Mallory . It is most good-natured of you to converse with me . My name is Susan ,<stage>GERVASE bows .</stage>Generally called Master Susan in these parts , or sometimes Gentleman Susan . I am a travelling Peddler by profession .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>A delightful profession , I am sure .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>The most delightful of all professions .<stage>He begins to undo his pack ,</stage>Speaking professionally for the moment , if I may so far venture , you are not in any need of boot-laces , buttons , or collar-studs ?</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p><stage>smiling</stage>Well , no , not at this actual moment . On almost any other day perhaps — but no , not this morning .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>I only just mentioned it in passing — en passant , as the French say .<stage>He brings out a paper bag from his pack .</stage>Would the fact of my eating my breakfast in this pleasant resting place detract at all from your appreciation of the beautiful day which Heaven has sent us ?</p>
      </sp>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>My dear sir , you do n't mean to tell me that you would do me the honour of joining me at my simple repast ?</p>

       <p>It is charming of you to say so , and I am very proud to be your guest , but I beg you to allow me to pay for this delightful cheese .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>No , no . I could n't hear of it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>I warn you that if you will not allow me to pay for this delightful cheese , I shall insist on buying all your boot-laces . Nay , more , I shall buy all your studs , and all your buttons . Your profession would then be gone .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>Well , well , shall we say tuppence ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Tuppence for a banquet like this ? My dear friend , nothing less than half-a-crown will satisfy me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>Sixpence . Not a penny more .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p><stage>with a sigh</stage>Very well , then .<stage>He begins to feel in his pocket , and in so doing reveals part of his dress . SUSAN opens his eyes at it , and then goes on eating . GERVASE finds his purse and produces sixpence , which he gives to SUSAN .</stage>Sir , I thank you .<stage>He resumes his breakfast .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>You are too generous . . . . Forgive me for asking , but you are not by chance a fellow-traveller upon the road ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Do you mean professionally ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>Yes . There is a young fellow , a contortionist and sword-swallower , known locally in these parts as Humphrey the Human Hiatus , who travels from village to village . Just for a moment I wondered —</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>He glances at GERVASE 's legs , which are uncovered . GERVASE hastily wraps his coat round them .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>I am not Humphrey . No . Gervase the Cheese Swallower . . . . Er — my costume —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>Please say nothing more . It was ill-mannered of me to have inquired . Let a man wear what he likes . It is a free world .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Well , the fact is , I have been having a bathe .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p><stage>with a bow</stage>I congratulate you on your bathing costume .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Not at all .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>You live near here then ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Little Malling . I came over in a car .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>Little Malling ? That 's about twenty miles away .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , much more than that surely .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>No . There 's Hedgling down there .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p><stage>surprised</stage>Hedgling ? Heavens , how I must have lost my way . . . . Then I have been within a mile of her all night . And I never knew !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>You are married , Mr. Mallory ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>No . Not yet .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>Get married .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>What ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>Take my advice and get married .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>You recommend it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>I do . . . . There is no companion like a wife , if you marry the right woman .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Oh ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>I have been married thirty years . Thirty years of happiness .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>But in your profession you must go away from your wife a good deal .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p><stage>smiling</stage>But then I come back to her a good deal .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p><stage>thoughtfully</stage>Yes , that must be rather jolly .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>Why do you think I welcomed your company so much when I came upon you here this morning ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p><stage>modestly</stage>Oh , well ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>It was something to tell my wife when I got back to her . When you are married , every adventure becomes two adventures . You have your adventure , and then you go back to your wife and have your adventure again . Perhaps it is a better adventure that second time . You can say the things which you did n't quite say the first time , and do the things which you did n't quite do . When my week 's travels are ever , and I go back to my wife , I shall have a whole week 's happenings to tell her . They wo n't lose in the telling , Mr. Mallory . Our little breakfast here this morning — she will love to hear about that . I can see her happy excited face as I tell her all that I said to you , and — if I can remember it — all that you said to me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p><stage>eagerly</stage>I say , how jolly !<stage>Thoughtfully</stage>You wo n't forget what I said about the Great Percy ? I thought that was rather good .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>I hope it was n't too good , Mr. Mallory . If it was , I shall find myself telling it to her as one of my own remarks . That 's why I say “ Get married . ” Then you can make things fair for yourself . You can tell her all the good things of mine which you said .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>But there must be more in marriage than that .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>There are a million things in marriage , but companionship is at the bottom of it all . . . . Do you know what companionship means ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>How do you mean ? Literally ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>The derivation of it in the dictionary . It means the art of having meals with a person . Cynics talk of the impossibility of sitting opposite the same woman every day at breakfast . Impossible to them , perhaps , poor shallow-hearted creatures , but not impossible to two people who have found what love is .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>It does n't sound very romantic .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p><stage>solemnly</stage>It is the most romantic thing in the whole world . . . . Some more cheese ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p><stage>taking it</stage>Thank you . . . .<stage>Thoughtfully</stage>Do you believe in love at first sight , Master Susan ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>Why not ? If it 's the woman you love at first sight , not only the face .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>I see .<stage>After a pause</stage>It 's rather hard to tell , you know . I suppose the proper thing to do is to ask her to have breakfast with you , and see how you get on .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>Well , you might do worse .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p><stage>laughing</stage>And propose to her after breakfast ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>If you will . It is better than proposing to her at a ball as some young people do , carried away suddenly by a snatched kiss in the moonlight .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p><stage>shaking his head</stage>Nothing like that happened last night .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>What does the Great Alfred say of the kiss ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>I never read the Daily Mail .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>Tennyson , Mr. Mallory , Tennyson .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , I beg your pardon .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>“ The kiss , ” says the Great Alfred , “ the woven arms , seem but to be weak symbols of the settled bliss , the comfort , I have found in thee . ” The same idea , Mr. Mallory . Companionship , or the art of having breakfast with a person .<stage>Getting up</stage>Well , I must be moving on . We have been companions for a short time ; I thank you for it . I wish you well .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p><stage>getting up</stage>I say , I 've been awfully glad to meet you . And I shall never forget the breakfast you gave me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>It is friendly of you to say so .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p><stage>hesitatingly</stage>You wo n't mind my having another one when Ernest comes back — I mean , if Ernest comes back ? You wo n't think I 'm slighting yours in any way ? But after an outdoor bathe , you know , one does ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p>Please ! I am happy to think you have such an appetite .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p><stage>holding out his hand</stage>Well , good-bye , Mr. Susan ,<stage>SUSAN looks at his hand doubtfully , and GERVASE says with a laugh</stage>Oh , come on !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p><stage>shaking it</stage>Good-bye , Mr. Mallory .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>And I sha n't forget what you said .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
       <p><stage>smiling</stage>I expect you will , Mr. Mallory . Good-bye .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>He goes off .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p><stage>calling after him</stage>Because it was n't the moonlight , it was n't really . It was just Her .<stage>To himself</stage>It was just Her . . . . I suppose the great Whatsisname would say , “ It was just She , ” but then , that is n't what I mean .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>GERVASE watches him going down the hill . Then he turns to the other side , says , “ Hallo ! ” suddenly in great astonishment , and withdraws a few steps .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>It can n't be !<stage>He goes cautiously forward and looks again</stage>It is !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>He comes back , and walks gently off through the trees .</stage>
      <stage>MELISANDE comes in . She has no hat ; her hair is in two plaits to her waist ; she is wearing a dress which might belong to any century . She stands in the middle of the glade , looks round it , holds out her hands to it for a moment , and then clasps them with a sigh of happiness . . . .</stage>
      <stage>GERVASE , his cloak thrown away , comes in behind her . For a moment he is half-hidden by the trees .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p><stage>very softly</stage>Princess !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>She hears but thinks she is still dreaming . She smiles a little .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p><stage>a little more loudly</stage>Princess !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>She listens and nods to herself , GERVASE steps out into the open .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Princess !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>She turns round .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking at him wonderingly</stage>You !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>At your service , Princess .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>It was you who came last night .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>I was at your father 's court last night . I saw you . You looked at me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>I thought it was only a dream when I looked at you . I thought it was a dream when you called me just now . Is it still a dream ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>If it is a dream , let us go on dreaming .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Where do you come from ? Fairyland ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>This is Fairyland . We are in the enchanted forest .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>It is for the Princess to say what we shall talk about . If your Royal Highness commands , then I will even talk about myself .</p>

       <p>I am called Gervase .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Gervase . It is a pretty name .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>I have been keeping it for this morning .</p>

       <lg>
        <l>It will be Prince Gervase , will it not , if this is</l>
        <l>Fairyland ?</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Alas , no . For I am only a humble woodcutter 's son . One of seven .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Of seven ? I thought that humble woodcutters always had three sons , and that it was the youngest who went into the world to seek his fortune .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Three — that 's right . I said “ one of several . ” Now that I count them up , three .<stage>Counting on his fingers</stage>Er — Bowshanks , er — Mulberry-face and myself . Three . I am the youngest .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>And the fairies came to your christening ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Now for the first time I think that they did .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>nodding</stage>They always come to the christening of the third and youngest son , and they make him the tallest and the bravest and the most handsome .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p><stage>modestly</stage>Oh , well .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>You are the tallest and the bravest and the most handsome , are n't you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p><stage>with a modest smile</stage>Well , of course , Mulberry-face is hardly a starter , and then Bowshanks —<stage>he indicates the curve of his legs</stage>— I mean , there 's not much competition .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>I have no sisters .</p>

       <p>The Princess never has sisters . She has suitors .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>with a sigh</stage>Yes , she has suitors .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>There is one dressed in black and white who seeks to win my hand .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p><stage>feeling the point</stage>He bites the dust to-morrow .</p>
      </sp>

       <p>To-morrow ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Unless it rains in the night . Perhaps it would be safer if we arranged for him to bite it this afternoon .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>How brave you are !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Say no more . It will be a pleasure .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Ah , but I cannot ask you to make this sacrifice for me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>The sacrifice will be his .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>But are you so certain that you will kill him ? Suppose he were to kill you ?</p>

       <p><stage>getting up</stage>Madam , when the third son of a humble woodcutter engages in mortal combat with one upon whom the beautiful Princess has frowned , there can be but one end to the struggle . To doubt this would be to let Romance go .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>You are right . I should never have doubted .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>At the same time , it would perhaps be as well to ask the help of my Uncle Otto .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>But is it fair to seek the assistance of an uncle in order to kill one small black and white suitor ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Ah , but he is a wizard . One is always allowed to ask the help of a wizard . My idea was that he should cast a spell upon the presumptuous youth who seeks to woo you , so that to those who gazed upon him he should have the outward semblance of a rabbit . He would then realise the hopelessness of his suit and . . . go away .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>with dignity</stage>I should certainly never marry a small black and white rabbit .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>No , you could n't , could you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>gravely</stage>No .<stage>Then their eyes meet . There is a twinkle in his ; hers respond ; and suddenly they are laughing together .</stage>What nonsense you talk !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Well , it 's such an absurdly fine morning , is n't it ? There 's a sort of sparkle in the air . I 'm really trying to be quite sensible .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>making room for him at her feet</stage>Go on talking nonsense .<stage>He sits down on the ground and leans against the log at her side .</stage>Tell me about yourself . You have told me nothing yet , but that<stage>she smiles at him</stage>your father is a woodcutter .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Yes . He — er — cuts wood .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>And you resolved to go out into the world and seek your fortune ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Yes . You see if you are a third son of a humble woodcutter , nobody thinks very much of you at home , and they never take you out with them ; and when you are cutting wood , they always put you where the sawdust gets into your mouth . Because , you see , they have never read history , and so they do n't know that the third and youngest son is always the nicest of the family .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>And the tallest and the bravest and the most handsome .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>And all the other things you mention .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>So you ran away ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>So I ran away — to seek my fortune .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>But your uncle the wizard , or your godmother or somebody , gave you a magic ring to take with you on your travels ?<stage>Nodding</stage>They always do , you know .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p><stage>showing the ring on his finger</stage>Yes , my fairy godmother gave me a magic ring . Here it is .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking at it</stage>What does it do ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>You turn it round once and think very hard of anybody you want , and suddenly the person you are thinking of appears before you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>How wonderful ! Have you tried it yet ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Once . . . . That 's why you are here .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Oh !<stage>Softly</stage>Have you been thinking of me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>All night .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>I dreamed of you all night .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p><stage>happily</stage>Did you , Melisande ? How dear of you to dream of me !<stage>Anxiously</stage>Was I — was I all right ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , yes !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p><stage>pleased</stage>Ah !<stage>He spreads himself a little and removes a speck of dust from his sleeve</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>thinking of it still</stage>You were so brave .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , I expect I 'm pretty brave in other people 's dreams — I 'm so cowardly in my own . Did I kill anybody ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>You were engaged in a terrible fight with a dragon when I woke up .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Leaving me and the dragon still asleep — I mean , still fighting ? Oh , Melisande , how could you leave us until you knew who had won ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>I tried so hard to get back to you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>I expect I was winning , you know . I wish you could have got back for the finish . . . . Melisande , let me come into your dreams again to-night .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>You never asked me last night . You just came .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Thank you for letting me come .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>And then when I woke up early this morning , the world was so young , so beautiful , so fresh that I had to be with it . It called to me so clearly — to come out and find its secret . So I came up here , to this enchanted place , and all the way it whispered to me — wonderful things .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>What did it whisper , Melisande ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>The secret of happiness .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Ah , what is it , Melisande ?<stage>She smiles and shakes her head</stage>I met a magician in the woods this morning .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Did he speak to you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>He told me the secret of happiness .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>What did he tell you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>He said it was marriage .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Ah , but he did n't mean by marriage what so many people mean .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>He seemed a very potent magician .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Marriage to many people means just food . Housekeeping . He did n't mean that .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>A very wise and reverend magician .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Love is romance . Is there anything romantic in breakfast — or lunch ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Well , not so much in lunch , of course , but — -</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>How well you understand ! Why do the others not understand ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p><stage>smiling at her</stage>Perhaps because they have not seen Melisande .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Oh no , no , that is n't it . All the others — -</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Do you mean your suitors ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Yes . They are so unromantic , so material . The clothes they wear ; the things they talk about . But you are so different . Why is it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>I do n't know . Perhaps because I am the third son of a woodcutter . Perhaps because they do n't know that you are the Princess . Perhaps because they have never been in the enchanted forest .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>What would the forest tell them ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>All the birds in the forest are singing “ Melisande ” ; the little brook runs through the forest murmuring “ Melisande ” ; the tall trees bend their heads and whisper to each other “ Melisande . ” All the flowers have put on their gay dresses for her . Oh , Melisande !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>awed</stage>Is it true ?<stage>They are silent for a little , happy to be together . . . . He looks back at her and gives a sudden little laugh .</stage>What is it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Just you and I — together — on the top of the world like this .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , that 's what I feel , too .<stage>After a pause</stage>Go on pretending .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Pretending ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>That the world is very young .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>We are very young , Melisande .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>timidly</stage>It is only a dream , is n't it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Who knows what a dream is ? Perhaps we fell asleep in Fairyland a thousand years ago , and all that we thought real was a dream , until now at last we are awake again .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>How wonderful that would be .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Perhaps we are dreaming now . But is it your dream or my dream , Melisande ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>after thinking it out</stage>I think I would rather it were your dream , Gervase . For then I should be in it , and that would mean that you had been thinking of me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Then it shall be my dream , Melisande .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Let it be a long one , my dear .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>For ever and for ever .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>dreamily</stage>Oh , I know that it is only a dream , and that presently we shall wake up ; or else that you will go away and I will go away , too , and we shall never meet again ; for in the real world , what could I be to you , or you to me ? So go on pretending .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>He stands up and faces her .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Melisande , if this were Fairyland , or if we were knights and ladies in some old romance , would you trust yourself to me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>So very proudly .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>You would let me come to your father 's court and claim you over all your other suitors , and fight for you , and take you away with me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>If this were Fairyland , yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>You would trust me ?</p>
      </sp>

       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>I would trust my lord .</p>

       <p><stage>smiling at her</stage>Then I will come for the Princess this afternoon .<stage>With sudden feeling</stage>Ah , how can I keep away now that I have seen the Princess ?</p>

       <p>It is no dream , Melisande . Or if it is a dream , then in my dream I love you , and if we are awake , then awake I love you . I love you if this is Fairyland , and if there is no Fairyland , then my love will make a faery land of the world for you . For I love you , Melisande .</p>

      <stage>It is about four o'clock in the afternoon of the same day . JANE is sitting on the sofa in the hall , glancing at a paper , but evidently rather bored with it , and hoping that somebody — BOBBY , did you say ?— will appear presently . However , it is MR. KNOWLE who comes in .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Ah , Jane !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking up</stage>Hallo , Uncle Henry . Did you have a good day ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Well , Peters and I had a very enjoyable drive .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>But you found nothing at the sale ? What a pity !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE<stage>taking a catalogue from his pocket</stage>Nothing which I wanted myself , but there were several very interesting lots . Peters was strongly tempted by Lot 29 — “ Two hip-baths and a stuffed crocodile . ” Very useful things to have by you if you think of getting married , Jane , and setting up house for yourself . I do n't know if you have any thoughts in that direction ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p><stage>a little embarrassed</stage>Well , I suppose I shall some day .</p>

       <p><stage>carelessly</stage>Bobby ? Oh , he 's about somewhere .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . I think Bobby would like to hear about Lot 29 .<stage>Returning to his catalogue</stage>Or perhaps Lot 42 . “ Lot 42 — Twelve aspidistras , towel-horse , and ‘ The Maiden 's Prayer . ’ ” All for seven and sixpence . I ought to have had Bobby with me . He could have made a firm offer of eight shillings . . . . By the way , I have a daughter , have n't I ? How was Sandy this morning ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>I did n't see her . Aunt Mary is rather anxious about her .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Has she left us for ever ?</p>

       <p>There 's nothing to be frightened about really .</p>

       <p>KNOWLE . I 'm not frightened .</p>

       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>She had breakfast before any of us were up , and went out with some sandwiches afterwards , and she has n't come back yet .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . A very healthy way of spending the day .<stage>MRS. KNOWLE comes in</stage>Well , Mary , I hear that we have no daughter now .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . My dear , I always meant to come back safely . Did n't you expect me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . I had given up hope . Jane here will tell you what a terrible morning I have had ; prostrate on the sofa , mourning for my loved ones . My only child torn from me , my husband — dead .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE<stage>surprised</stage>Oh , I was dead ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . I pictured the car smashed to atoms , and you lying in the road , dead , with Peters by your side .</p>

       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Ah ! How was Peters ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE<stage>with a shrug</stage>I did n't look . What is a chauffeur to one who has lost her husband and her only child in the same morning ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Still , I think you might have looked .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Sandy 's all right , Aunt Mary . You know she often goes out alone all day like this .</p>

       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>KNOWLE . Ah , is she alone ? Jane , did you count the gardeners as</l>

       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Count the gardeners ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . To make sure that none of them is missing too .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>It 's quite all right , Aunt Mary . Sandy will be back by tea-time .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE<stage>resigned</stage>It all comes of christening her Melisande . You know , Henry , I quite thought you said Millicent .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Well , talking about tea , my dear — at which happy meal our long-lost daughter will be restored to us — we have a visitor coming , a nice young fellow who takes an interest in prints .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . I 've heard nothing of this , Henry .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . No , my dear , that 's why I 'm telling you now .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . A young man ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Nice-looking ?</p>
      </sp>

       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Rich ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . I forgot to ask him , Mary . However , we can remedy that omission as soon as he arrives .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . It 's a very unfortunate day for him to have chosen . Here 's Sandy lost , and I 'm not fit to be seen , and — Jane , your hair wants tidying ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . He is not coming to see you or Sandy or Jane , my dear ; he is coming to see me . Fortunately , I am looking very beautiful this afternoon .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Jane , you had better be in the garden , dear , and see if you can stop Sandy before she comes in , and just give her a warning . I do n't know what she 'll look like after roaming the fields all day , and falling into pools ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . A sweet disorder in the dress kindles in clothes a wantonness .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . I will go and tidy myself . Jane , I think your mother would like you to — but , after all , one must think of one 's own child first . You will tell Sandy , wo n't you ? We had better have tea in here . . . . Henry , your trousers —<stage>she looks to see that JANE is not listening , and then says in a loud whisper</stage>your trousers ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . I 'm afraid I did n't make myself clear , Mary . It 's a young fellow who is coming to see my prints ; not the Prince of Wales who is coming to see my trousers .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MRS</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE<stage>turning to JANE</stage>You 'll remember , Jane ?</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Ah ! . . . Your aunt was n't very lucid , Jane . Which one of you is it who is going to marry the gentleman ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Do n't be so absurd , Uncle Henry .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE<stage>taking out his catalogue again</stage>Perhaps he would be interested in Lot 29 .<stage>BOBBY comes in through the windows .</stage>Ah , here 's Bobby . Bobby , they tell me that you think of setting up house .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking quickly at JANE</stage>Who told you that ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MR</speaker>
       <p>KNOWLE . Now , starting with two hip-baths and a stuffed crocodile for nine shillings and sixpence , and working up to twelve aspidistras , a towel-horse and “ The Maiden 's Prayer ” for eight shillings , you practically have the spare room furnished for seventeen and six . But perhaps I had better leave the catalogue with you .<stage>He presses it into the bewildered BOBBY 'S hands</stage>I must go and tidy myself up . Somebody is coming to propose to me this afternoon .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>He hurries out .</stage>
      <stage>BOBBY looks after him blankly , and then turns to JANE .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>I say , what 's happened ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>

       <p>Happened ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>Yes , why did he say that about my setting up house ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>I think he was just being funny . He is sometimes , you know .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>You do n't think he guessed ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Guessed what ? About you and Melisande ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BOBBY</speaker>
       <p>I say , shut up , Jane . I thought we agreed not to say anything more about that .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>But what else could he have guessed ?</p>

Because you 're so frightfully fascinating , that after twenty-four hours of it , I simply have to tell you how much I love you , then your pride is hurt .

       <p>Yes , but that 's so vague , darling . Do you mean that ——</p>

       <p><stage>dreamily</stage>I have seen him ; I have talked to him ; he has kissed me .</p>

       <p>I have looked into his eyes , and he has looked into mine .</p>

       <p>Yes , but who ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>

       <p>The true knight , the prince , for whom I have been waiting so long .</p>

       <p>But who is he ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>They call him Gervase .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Gervase who ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>

       <p><stage>scornfully</stage>Did Elaine say , “ Lancelot who ” when they told her his name was Lancelot ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Yes , dear , but this is the twentieth century . He must have a name .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>dreamily</stage>Through the forest he came to me , dressed in blue and gold .</p>

       <p>I mean — blue and gold . They do n't do it nowadays .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>But how ?— Why ? Who can he be ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>He said he was a humble woodcutter 's son . That means he was a prince in disguise . He called me his princess .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Darling , how could he be a prince ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>I have read stories sometimes of men who went to sleep and woke up thousands of years afterwards and found themselves in a different world . Perhaps , Jane , he lived in those old days , and ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Did he talk like an ordinary person ?</p>
      </sp>

       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Oh no , no !</p>

       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Well , it 's really extraordinary . . . . Was he a gentleman ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>smiling at her</stage>I did n't ask him , Jane .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p><stage>crossly</stage>You know what I mean .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>He is coming this afternoon to take me away .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p><stage>amazed</stage>To take you away ? But what about Aunt Mary ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>vaguely</stage>Aunt Mary ? What has she got to do with it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p><stage>impatiently</stage>Oh , but ——<stage>With a shrug of resignation</stage>I do n't understand . Do you mean he 's coming here ?<stage>MELISANDE nods gravely</stage>Melisande , you 'll let me see him ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Yes . I 've thought it all out . I wanted you here , Jane . He will come in ; I will present you ; and then you must leave us alone . But I should like you to see him . Just to see how different , how utterly different he is from every other man . . . . But you will promise to go when you have seen him , wo n't you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p><stage>nodding</stage>I 'll say , “ I 'm afraid I must leave you now , and —— ” Sandy , how can he be a prince ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>When you see him , Jane , you will say , “ How can he not be a prince ? ”</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>But one has to leave princes backward . I mean — he wo n't expect — you know ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>I do n't think so . Besides , after all , you are my cousin .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>JANE</speaker>
       <p>Yes . I think I shall get that in ; just to be on the safe side . “ Well , cousin , I must leave you now , as I have to attend my aunt . ” And then a sort of — not exactly a curtsey , but —<stage>she practises , murmuring the words to herself</stage>I suppose you did n't happen to mention me to him this morning ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>half smiling</stage>Oh no !</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>I do n't know .<stage>She grips JANE 'S arm suddenly</stage>Jane , I did n't dream it all this morning , did I ? It did happen ? I saw him — he kissed me — he is coming for me — he ——</p>

      <stage>JANE looks from one to the other in bewilderment .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>I ought to explain . Mr. Knowle was kind enough to lend me some petrol last night ; my car broke down ; he was good enough to say I might come this afternoon and see his prints . I am hoping to be allowed to thank him again for his kindness last night . And — er — I 've brought back the petrol .</p>
      </sp>

       <p>I say , you know —<stage>he tries again</stage>I do n't want you to — to feel that — I mean , just because I asked you twice — I mean I do n't want you to feel that — well , I mean you must n't do it just for my sake , Sandy . I mean Melisande .</p>

       <p>You know , I was thinking about it last night — afterwards , you know — and I began to see , I began to see that perhaps you were right . I mean about my not being romantic and — and all that . I mean , I 'm rather an ordinary sort of chap , and ——</p>

       <p><stage>eagerly</stage>No , no . No , that 's where you 're wrong , Sandy . I mean Melisande . You are n't ordinary . I do n't say you 'd be throwing yourself away on me , but — but I think you could find somebody more suitable .<stage>Earnestly</stage>I 'm sure you could . I mean somebody who would remember to call you Melisande , and who would read poetry with you and — and all that . I mean , there are lots of fellows ——</p>

      </sp>
      <stage>She walks about , pulling at her handkerchief and telling herself that she wo n't cry . But she feels that she is going to , and she goes to the open windows , and stands for a moment looking out , trying to recover herself</stage>

      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>I think you had better leave this morning out of it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>But if I leave this morning out of it , then I have only just met you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>That is what I would prefer .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Oh ! . . . Then if I have only just met you , perhaps I ought n't to have said straight off that I want to marry you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>It is unusual .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Yes . But not unusual to want to marry you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>I am not interested in your wants .</p>

       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Very easy for you , I should think .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>But not for you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>bitterly</stage>You dress up and amuse yourself , and then laugh and go back to your ordinary life again — you do n't want to remember that , do you , every time you do it ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>You let your hair down and flirt with me and laugh and go home again , but you can n't forget . Why should I ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>furiously</stage>How dare you say I flirted with you ?</p>

       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>How dare you say I laughed at you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Do you think I knew you would be there when I went up to the wood ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Do you think I knew you would be there when I went up ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Then why were you there all dressed up like that ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>My car broke down and I spent the night in it . I went up the hill to look for breakfast .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Breakfast ! That 's all you think about .</p>

       <p>Dear hands . . . . May I kiss your lips , Melisande ?<stage>She says nothing . He comes closer to her</stage>Melisande !</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>He is about to put his arms round her , but she breaks away from him .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Oh , do n't , do n't ! What 's the good of pretending ? It was only pretence this morning — what 's the good of going on with it ? I thought you were so different from other men , but you 're just the same , just the same . You talk about the things they talk about , you wear the clothes they wear . You were my true knight , my fairy Prince , this morning , and this afternoon you come down dressed like that<stage>she waves her hand at it</stage>and tell me that you are on the Stock Exchange ! Oh , can n't you see what you 've done ? All the beautiful world that I had built up for you and me — shattered , shattered .</p>

       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p><stage>with a smile</stage>Well , that 's not quite fair , you know .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>What do you mean ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Well , what about my beautiful world — the world that I had built up ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>I do n't understand .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>What about your pretence this morning ? I thought you were so different from other women , but you 're just the same , just the same . You were my true lady , my fairy Princess , this morning ; and this afternoon the Queen , your mother , disabled herself by indigestion , tells me that you do all the housekeeping for her just like any ordinary commonplace girl . Your father , the King , has obviously never had a battle-axe in his hand in his life ; your suitor , Prince Robert of Coote , is much more at home with a niblick than with a lance ; and your cousin , the Lady Jane ——</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>sinking on to the sofa and hiding her face</stage>Oh , cruel , cruel !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p><stage>remorsefully</stage>Oh , forgive me , Melisande . It was horrible of me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>No , but it 's true . How could any romance come into this house ? Now you know why I wanted you to take me away — away to the ends of the earth with you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Well , that 's what I want to do .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Ah , do n't ! When you 're on the Stock Exchange !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>But there 's plenty of romance on the Stock Exchange .<stage>Nodding his head</stage>Oh yes , you want to look out for it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>reproachfully</stage>Now you 're laughing at me again .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>My dear , I 'm not . Or if I am laughing at you , then I am laughing at myself too . And if we can laugh together , then we can be happy together , Melisande .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>I want romance , I want beauty . I do n't want jokes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>I see what it is . You do n't like my knickerbockers .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>bewildered</stage>Did you expect me to ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>No .<stage>After a pause</stage>I think that 's why I put ‘ em on .<stage>She looks at him in surprise .</stage>You see , we had to come back to the twentieth century some time ; we could n't go on pretending for ever . Well , here we are —<stage>indicating his clothes</stage>— back . But I feel just as romantic , Melisande . I want beauty — your beauty — just as much .<stage>He goes to her .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Which Melisande do you want ? The one who talked to you this morning in the wood , or the one who —<stage>bitterly</stage>does all the housekeeping for her mother ?<stage>Violently</stage>And badly , badly , badly !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>The one who does all the housekeeping for her mother — and badly , badly , badly , bless her , because she has never realised what a gloriously romantic thing housekeeping is .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>amazed</stage>Romantic !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p><stage>with enthusiasm</stage>Most gloriously romantic . . . . Did you ever long when you were young to be wrecked on a desert island ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>clasping her hands</stage>Oh yes !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>You imagined yourself there — alone or with a companion ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Often !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>And what were you doing ? What is the romance of the desert island which draws us all ? Climbing the bread-fruit tree , following the turtle to see where it deposits its eggs , discovering the spring of water , building the hut — housekeeping , Melisande . . . . Or take Robinson Crusoe . When Man Friday came along and left his footprint in the sand , why did Robinson Crusoe stagger back in amazement ? Because he said to himself , like a good housekeeper , “ By Jove , I 'm on the track of a servant at last . ” There 's romance for you !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>smiling and shaking her head at him</stage>What nonsense you talk !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>It is n't nonsense ; indeed , indeed it is n't . There 's romance everywhere if you look for it . You look for it in the old fairy-stories , but did they find it there ? Did the gentleman who had just been given a new pair of seven-league boots think it romantic to be changed into a fish ? He probably thought it a confounded nuisance , and wondered what on earth to do with his boots . Did Cinderella and the Prince find the world romantic after they were married ? Think of the endless silent evenings which they spent together , with nothing in common but an admiration for Cinderella 's feet — do you think they did n't long for the romantic days of old ? And in two thousand or two hundred thousand years , people will read stories about us , and sigh and say , “ Will those romantic days never come back again ? ” Ah , they are here now , Melisande , for us ; for the people with imagination ; for you and for me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p>Are they ? Oh , if I could believe they were !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>You thought of me as your lover and true knight this morning . Ah , but what an easy thing to be ! You were my Princess . Look at yourself in the glass — how can you help being a princess ? But if we could be companions , Melisande ! That 's difficult ; that 's worth trying .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>gently</stage>What do you want me to do ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>Get used to me . See me in a top-hat — see me in a bowler-hat . Help me with my work ; play games with me — I 'll teach you if you do n't know how . I want to share the world with you for all our lives . That 's a long time , you know ; we can n't do it on one twenty-minutes ’ practice before breakfast . We can be lovers so easily — can we be friends ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>looking at him gravely</stage>You are very wise .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>GERVASE</speaker>
       <p>I talked with a wise man in the wood this morning ; I 've been thinking over what he said .<stage>Suddenly</stage>But when you look at me like that , how I long to be a fool and say , “ Come away with me now , now , now , ” you wonderful , beautiful , maddening woman , you adorable child , you funny foolish little girl .<stage>Holding up a finger</stage>Smile , Melisande . Smile !<stage>Slowly , reluctantly , she gives him a smile .</stage>I suppose the fairies taught you that . Keep it for me , will you — but give it to me often . Do you ever laugh , Melisande ? We must laugh together sometimes — that makes life so easy .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>MELISANDE</speaker>
       <p><stage>with a happy little laugh</stage>Oh , what can I say to you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>

      <stage>MELISANDE stays there , looking after him , her hand to her cheek . . . . But one cannot stand thus for ever . The new life must begin . With a little smile at herself , at GERVASE , at things , she fetches out the Great Book from its hiding-place , where she had buried it many weeks ago in disgust . Now it comes into its own . She settles down with it in her favourite chair . . . .</stage>

      <stage>But you know how the romantic passage goes . We have her with it , curled up in the chair , this adorable child , this funny foolish little girl .</stage>

     <stage>THE STEPMOTHER</stage>
     <stage>A summer morning . The sunniest and perhaps the pleasantest room in the London house of SIR JOHN PEMBURY , M. P . For this reason LADY PEMBURY uses it a good deal , although it is not officially hers . It is plainly furnished , and probably set out to be a sort of waiting-room for SIR JOHN 'S many callers , but LADY PEMBURY has left her mark upon it .</stage>
     <stage>PERKINS , the butler , inclining to stoutness , but not yet past his prime , leads the may in , followed by THE STRANGER , PERKINS has already placed him as “ one of the lower classes , ” but the intelligent person in the pit perceives that he is something better than that , though whether he is in the process of falling from a higher estate , or of rising to it , is not so clear . He is thirty odd , shabbily dressed ( but then , so are most of us nowadays ) , and ill at ease ; not because he is shabby , but because he is ashamed of himself . To make up for this , he adopts a blustering manner , as if to persuade himself that he is a fine fellow after all . There is a touch of commonness about his voice , but he is not uneducated .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PERKINS</speaker>
      <p>I 'll tell Sir John you 're here , but I do n't say he 'll see you , mind .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Do n't you worry about that . He 'll see me right enough .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PERKINS</speaker>
      <p>He 's busy just now . Well ——<stage>He looks at THE STRANGER doubtfully .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>bitterly</stage>I suppose you think I 've got no business in a gentleman 's house . Is that it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PERKINS</speaker>
      <p>Well , I did n't say so , did I ? Maybe you 're a constituent ? Being in the ‘ Ouse of Commons , we get some pretty queer ones at times . All sorts , as you might say . . . . P'raps you 're a deputation ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>violently</stage>What the hell 's it got to do with you who I am . You go and tell your master I 'm here — that 's all you 've got to do . See ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PERKINS</speaker>
      <p><stage>unruffled</stage>Easy , now , easy . You ‘ ave n't even told me your name yet . Is it the Shah of Persia or Mr. Bottomley ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>The less said about names the better . You say , “ Somebody from Lambeth ” — he 'll know what I mean .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PERKINS</speaker>
      <p><stage>humorously</stage>Ah , I beg your pardon — the Archbishop of Canterbury . I did n't recognise your Grace .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>angrily</stage>It 's people like you who make one sick of the world . Parasites — servile flunkeys , bolstering up an effete aristocracy . Why do n't you get some proper work to do ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PERKINS</speaker>
      <p><stage>good-naturedly</stage>Now , look here , young man , this is n't the time for that sort of talk . If you 've got anything you want to get off your chest about flunkeys or monkeys , or whatever it may be , keep it till Sunday afternoon — when I 'm off duty .<stage>He comes a little closer to THE STRANGER</stage>Four o'clock Sunday afternoon —<stage>jerking his thumb over his shoulder</stage>— just round the corner — in the Bolton Mews . See ? Nobody there to interrupt us . See ? All quite gentlemanly and secluded , and a friend of mine to hold the watch . See ?<stage>He edges closer as he talks .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>retreating nervously</stage>No offence meant , mate . We 're in the same boat — you and me ; we do n't want to get fighting . My quarrel is n't with you . You go and tell Sir John that there 's a gentleman come to see him — wants a few minutes of his valuable time — from Lambeth way . He 'll know . That 's all right .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PERKINS</speaker>
      <p><stage>drawing back , disappointedly</stage>Then I sha n't be seeing you Sunday afternoon ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>laughing awkwardly</stage>There , that 's all right . No offence meant . Somebody from Lambeth — that 's what you 've got to say . And tell ‘ im I 'm in a hurry . He 'll know what I mean .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PERKINS</speaker>
      <p><stage>going slowly to the door</stage>Well , it 's a queer game , but being in the ‘ Ouse of Commons , one can n't never be surprised . All sorts , as you might say , all sorts .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Exit PERKINS .</stage>
     <stage>THE STRANGER , left alone , walks up and down the room , nervously impatient .</stage>
     <stage>LADY PEMBURY comes in . In twenty-eight years of happy married life , she has mothered one husband and five daughters , but she has never had a son — her only sorrow . Her motto might be , “ It is just as easy to be kind ” ; and whether you go to her for comfort or congratulation , you will come away feeling that she is the only person who really understands .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>Oh !<stage>She stops and then comes towards THE STRANGER</stage>How do you do ? Are you waiting to see my husband ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>taken aback at seeing her</stage>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He is not sure for the moment if this upsets his plans or forwards them .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>I think he 's engaged just now . But he wo n't be long . Perkins will tell him as soon as he is free .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>contemptuously</stage>His name is Perkins , is it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>surprised</stage>The butler ? Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>contemptuously</stage>Mister Perkins , the Butler .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a friendly smile</stage>You do n't mind our having a butler ?<stage>She picks up some work from the table and takes it to the sofa</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>shrugging his shoulders</stage>One more parasite .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>interested</stage>I always thought parasites were much smaller than Perkins .<stage>Sitting down</stage>Do sit down , wo n't you ?<stage>He sits down reluctantly .</stage>You must n't mind my being here . This is really my work-room . I expect my husband will take you into his own room when he 's ready .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Your work-room ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>looking up at him with a smile</stage>You do n't seem to like our domestic arrangements .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>waving his hand at her embroidery</stage>You call that work ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>pleasantly</stage>Other people 's work always seems so contemptible , does n't it ? Now I expect if you tried to do this , you would find it very difficult indeed , and if I tried to do yours — what is your work , Mr .— er — Dear me , I do n't even know your name .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>bitterly</stage>Never mind my name . Take it that I have n't got a name .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>But your friends must call you something .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Take it that I have n't got any friends .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>Oh , do n't say that ! How can you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>surly</stage>What 's it matter to you whether anybody cares about me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>Oh , never mind whether anybody cares about you ; do n't you care about anybody ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Nobody .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>Poor , poor man !<stage>Going on with her work</stage>If you can n't tell me your name , I wish you would tell me what work you do .<stage>Winningly</stage>You do n't mind my asking , do you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>I can tell you what work I 'm going to do after to-day .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>Oh , do !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>violently</stage>None !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>surprised</stage>None ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>No more work after to-day .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>Wo n't that be rather dull ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Well , you ought to know . I 'm going to be one of the idle rich — like you and Sir John — and let other people work for me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>thoughtfully</stage>I should n't have said my husband was idle . But there it is . No two people ever agree as to what is work and what is n't .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>What do you know about work — you aristocrats ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>mildly</stage>My husband is only a K. B. E ., you know . Quite a recent creation .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>not heeding her</stage>You , who 've been brought up in the lap of luxury — never known a day 's discomfort in your life ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>My dear young man , you really must n't tell a woman who has had five children that she has never known a day 's discomfort in her life . . . . Ask any woman .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>upset</stage>What 's that ? . . . I did n't come here to argue with you . You began it . Why can n't you let me alone ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>going to a side-table and taking up a photograph</stage>Five children — all girls — and now I 'm a grandmother .<stage>Showing him the photograph</stage>There ! That 's my eldest daughter with her eldest son and my eldest grandchild . Is n't he a duck ? He 's supposed to be like me . . . . I never had a son of my own .<stage>THE STRANGER has taken the photograph in his hand and is holding it awkwardly .</stage>Oh , let me take it away from you . Other 's people 's relations are so uninteresting , are n't they ?<stage>She takes it away and puts it back in its place . Then she returns to her seat and goes on with her work .</stage>So you 've made a lot of money ? How exciting for you !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>grimly</stage>I have n't got it yet , but it 's coming .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>Soon ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>To-day .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>You 're not married , are you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>You want to know a lot , do n't you ? Well , I 'm not married .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>I was thinking how much nicer it is when you can share that sort of news with somebody else , somebody you love . It makes good news so much better , and bad news so much more bearable .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>That 's what you and your husband do , is it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>nodding</stage>Always . For eight-and-twenty years .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>He tells you everything , eh ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>Well , not his official secrets , of course . Everything else .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Ha ! I wonder .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>But you have nobody , you say . Well , you must share your good news with me . Will you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Oh yes , you shall hear about it all right .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>That 's nice of you . Well then , first question . How much money is it going to be ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>thoughtfully</stage>Well , I do n't quite know yet . What do you say to a thousand a year ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>Oh , but what a lot !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>You think a thousand a year would be all right . Enough to live on ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>For a bachelor , ample .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>For a bachelor .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>There 's no one dependent on you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Not a soul . Only got one relation living .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>Oh ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>enjoying a joke of his own</stage>A father . But I shall not be supporting him . Oh no . Far from it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>a little puzzled by this , though the is not going to show it</stage>Then I think you will be very rich with a thousand a year .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Yes , that 's what I thought . I should think it would stand a thousand .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>What is it ? An invention of some sort ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Oh no , not an invention . . . . A discovery .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>How proud she would have been !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Who ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>Your wife if you had had one ; your mother if she had been alive .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>violently</stage>Look here , you leave my mother out of it . My business is with Sir John ——<stage>sneeringly</stage>Sir John Pembury , K. B. E . If I want to talk about my mother , he and I will have a nice little talk together about her . Yes , and about my father , too .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>LADY PEMBURY understands at last . She stands up slowly , and looks at him , horrified .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>What do you mean ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>A thousand a year . You said so yourself . Yes , I think it 's worth a thousand a year .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>Who is your father ? What 's your name ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Did n't I tell you I had n't got a name ?<stage>Bitterly</stage>And if you want to know why , ask Sir John Pembury , K. B. E .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>in a whisper</stage>He 's your father .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>upset by her emotion</stage>Look here , I did n't want all this . I ask you — did I begin it ? It was you who kept asking questions . I just came for a quiet talk with Sir John — Father and Son talking together quietly — talking about Son 's allowance . A thousand a year . What did you want to come into it for ?</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>LADY PEMBURY is quiet again now . She wipes away a tear or two , and sits up , looking at him thoughtfully .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>So you are the son that I never had .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>What d'you mean ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>almost to herself</stage>The son whom I wanted so . Five girls — never a boy . Let me look at you .<stage>She goes up to him .</stage></p>

      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>looking at him earnestly to see if she can see a likeness</stage>No — and yet —<stage>shaking her head sadly</stage>Poor boy ! What an unhappy life you must have had !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>I did n't come here to be pitied . I came to get my rightful allowance — same as any other son .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>to herself</stage>Poor boy !<stage>She goes back to her seat and then says</stage>You do n't mind my asking you questions now , do you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Go on . There 's no mistake about it . I can promise you that .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>How did you find out ? Did your Mother tell you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Never a word . “ Do n't ask questions , sonny —— ” “ Father 's dead ” — all that sort of thing .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>Does Sir John know ? Did he ever know ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>feeling in his pocket</stage>He knew right enough .<stage>Bringing out letters</stage>Look here — here you are . This was how I found out .<stage>Selecting one</stage>There — read that one .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>taking it</stage>Yes — that 's John 's writing .<stage>She holds it out to him .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Are n't you going to read it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>shaking her head pathetically</stage>He did n't write it to me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>He did n't write it to me , if it comes to that .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>You 're her son — you have a right . I 'm — nobody .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>putting it back in his pocket</stage>Oh well , please yourself .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>Did Sir John provide for your mother ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Well , why should n't he ? He was a rich man .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>Not in those days . . . . But indeed — why should n't he ? What else could he do ? I 'm glad he did .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>And now he 's going to provide for his loving son . He 's rich enough for that in these days .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>He 's never seen you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Never . The historic meeting of Father and Son will take place this afternoon .<stage>With a feeble attempt at what he thinks is the aristocratic manner</stage>Afraid the Governor will be in the deuce of a rage . Been exceedin ’ my allowance — what ? Make it a thousand , dear old Gov .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>Do n't they call that blackmail ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>violently</stage>Now look here , I 'd better tell you straight that there 's no blackmail about this at all . He 's my father , is n't he ? Well , can n't a son come to his father if he 's hard up ? Where are your threatening letters ? Where 's the blackmail ? Anyway , what 's he going to do about it ? Put his son in prison ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>following her own thoughts</stage>You 're thirty . Thank God for that . We had n't met then . . . . Ah , but he ought to have told me . He ought to have told me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>P'raps he thought you would n't marry him , if he did .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>Do you think that was it ?<stage>Earnestly to him , as if he were an old friend</stage>You know men — young men . I never had a son ; I never had any brothers . Do they tell ? They ought to , ought n't they ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Well — well , if you ask me — I say , look here , this is n't the sort of thing one discusses with a lady .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>Is n't it ? But one can talk to a friend .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>scornfully</stage>You and me look like friends , do n't we ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>smiling</stage>Well , we do , rather .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He gets up hastily and moves further away from her .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>I know what your game is . Do n't think I do n't see it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>What is it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>Falling on your knees , and saying with tears in your eyes :</l>
       <l>“ Oh , kind friend , spare me poor husband ! ” I know the sort of thing .</l>
       <l>And trying to work me up friendly before you begin .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>shaking her head</stage>No , if I went on my knees to you , I should n't say that . How can you hurt my husband now ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Well , I do n't suppose the scandal will do him much good . Not an important Member of Parliament like him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>Ah , but it is n't the outside things that really hurt you , the things which are done to you , but the things which you do to yourself . And so if I went on my knees to you , it would not be for my husband 's sake . For I should go on my knees , and I should say : “ Oh , my son that might have been , think before you give up everything that a man should have . Ambition , hope , pride , self-respect — are not these worth keeping ? Is your life to end now ? Have you done all that you came into the world to do , so that now you can look back and say , ‘ It is finished ; I have given all that I had to give ; henceforward I will spend ’ ? ”<stage>Very gently</stage>Oh , my son that might have been !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>very uncomfortable</stage>Here , I say , that is n't fair .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>gently</stage>When did your mother die ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Look here , I wish you would n't keep on about mothers .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>When did she die , proud mother ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>sulkily</stage>Well , why should n't she be proud ?<stage>After a pause</stage>Two years ago , if you want to know .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>It was then that you found out who your father was ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>That 's right . I found these old letters . She 'd kept them locked up all those years . Bit of luck for me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>almost to herself</stage>And that was two years ago . And for two years you had your hopes , your ambitions , for two years you were proud and independent . . . . Why did you not come to us then ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a touch of vanity</stage>Well , I was getting on all right , you know — and ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>And then suddenly , after two years , you lost hope .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>I lost my job .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>Poor boy ! And could n't get another .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>bitterly</stage>It 's a beast of a world if you 're down . He 's in the gutter — kick him down — trample on him . Nobody wants him . That 's the way to treat them when they 're down . Trample on ‘ em .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>And so you came to your father to help you up again . To help you out of the gutter .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>That 's right .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>pleadingly</stage>Ah , but give him a chance !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Now , look here , I 've told you already that I 'm not going to have any of that game .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>shaking her head sadly</stage>Foolish boy ! You do n't understand . Give him a chance to help you out of the gutter .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Well , I 'm ——! Is n't that what I am doing ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>No , no . You 're asking him to trample you right down into it , deeper and deeper into the mud and slime . I want you to let him help you back to where you were two years ago — when you were proud and hopeful .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>looking at her in a puzzled way</stage>I can n't make out what your game is . It 's no good pretending you do n't hate the sight of me — it stands to reason you must .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>smiling</stage>But then women are unreasonable , are n't they ? And I think it is only in fairy-stories that stepmothers are always so unkind .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>surprised</stage>Stepmother !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>Well , that 's practically what I am , is n't it ?</l>
       <stage>Whimsically</stage>
       <l>I 've never been a stepmother before .</l>
       <stage>Persuasively</stage>
       <l>Could n't you let me be proud of my stepson ?</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Well , you are a one ! . . . Do you mean to say that you and your husband are n't going to have a row about this ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>It 's rather late to begin a row , is n't it , thirty years after it 's happened ? . . . Besides , perhaps you are n't going to tell him anything about it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>But what else have I come for except to tell him ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>To tell me . . . . I asked you to give him a chance of helping you out of your troubles , but I 'd rather you gave me the chance . . . . You see , John would be very unhappy if he knew that I knew this ; and he would have to tell me , because when a man has been happily married to anybody for twenty-eight years , he can n't really keep a secret from the other one . He pretends to himself that he can , but he knows all the time what a miserable pretence it is . And so John would tell me , and say he was sorry , and I would say : “ It 's all right , darling , I knew , ” but it would make him ashamed , and he would be afraid that perhaps I was n't thinking him such a wonderful man as I did before . And it 's very bad for a public man like John when he begins to lose faith in what his wife is thinking about him . . . . So let me be your friend , will you ?<stage>There is a silence between them for a little . He looks at her wonderingly . Suddenly she stands up , her finger to her lips</stage>H'sh ! It 's John .<stage>She moves away from him</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <stage>SIR JOHN PEMBURY comes in quickly ; big , good-looking , decisive , friendly ; a man who wears very naturally , and without any self-consciousness , an air of being somebody .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>walking hastily past his wife to her writing-desk</stage>Hallo , darling ! Did I leave a cheque-book in here ? I was writing a cheque for you this morning . Ah , here we are .<stage>As he comes back , he sees THE STRANGER</stage>I beg your pardon , Kate . I did n't see ——<stage>He is making for the door with the cheque-book in his hand , and then stops and says with a pleasant smile to THE STRANGER</stage>But , perhaps you are waiting to see me ? Perkins said something ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>coming forward</stage>Yes , I came to see you , Sir John .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He stands close in front of SIR JOHN , looking at him . LADY PEMBURY watches them steadfastly .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>tapping his cheque-book against his hand</stage>Important ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>I came to ask your help .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>looking at his cheque-book and then back with a smile at THE STRANGER</stage>A good many people do that . Have you any special claim on me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>after a long pause</stage>No .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>PEMBURY looks at him , undecided , LADY PEMBURY comes forward .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>All right , dear .</l>
       <stage>Meaning that she will look after THE STRANGER till he comes back .</stage>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>I 'll be back in a moment .<stage>He nods and hurries out</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <stage>There is silence for a little , and then LADY PEMBURY claps her hands gently .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>with shining eyes</stage>Oh , brave , brave ! Ah , but I am a proud stepmother to-day .<stage>She holds out her hand to him</stage>Thank you , son .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>not seeing it , and speaking in a hard voice</stage>I 'd better go .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>May n't I help you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>I 'd better go .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>distressed</stage>You can n't go like this . I do n't even know your name , nor where you live .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Do n't be afraid — you sha n't hear from me again .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>gently</stage>Not even when you 've got back to where you were two years ago ? May n't I then ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>looking at her , and then nodding slowly</stage>Yes , you shall then .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>Thank you . I shall wait . I shall hope . I shall pray .<stage>She holds out her hand again</stage>Good-bye !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>shaking his head</stage>Wait till you hear from me .<stage>He goes to the door , and then stops and comes slowly back . He says awkwardly</stage>Wish you 'd do one thing for me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>Yes ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>That fellow — what did you say his name was — Perkins ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>surprised</stage>The butler ? Perkins — yes ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p>Would you give him a message from me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>Of course .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STRANGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>still awkwardly</stage>Just to say — I 'll be there — at the Mews — on Sunday afternoon . He 'll know . Tell him I 'll be there .<stage>He squares his shoulders and walks out defiantly — ready to take the world on again — beginning with PERKINS on Sunday afternoon</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <stage>LADY PEMBURY stands watching him as he goes . She waits after he has gone , thinking her own thoughts , out of which she comes with something of a shock as the door opens and SIR JOHN comes in .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>Hallo ! Has he gone ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>What did he want ? Five pounds — or a place in the Cabinet ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>He came for — a subscription .</p>

      <speaker>PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p>And got it , if I know my Kate .<stage>Carelessly</stage>What did he take from you ?</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>LADY PEMBURY</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a wistful little sigh</stage>Yes ; he took something from me . Not very much , I think . But just — something .<stage>She takes his arm , leads him to the sofa , and says affectionately</stage>And now tell me all that you 've been doing this morning .<stage>So he begins to tell her — just as he has told her a thousand times before . . . .
