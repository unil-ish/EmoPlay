    <speaker>THURSDAY EVENING</speaker>
    <p>SCENE A small suburban kitchen in the modest home of Mr. and Mrs. Gordon Johns . A meal has recently been cooked , as is shown by a general confusion of pots and pans and dish-cloths . At the rear , an icebox standing in the corner . Rear , center , two shelved cabinets , one containing groceries and household sundries , the other dishes and glassware . Rear , L , an oil range . Some baby linen and very small shirts<stage>such as would be suitable for a child of about ten months ’</stage>are hanging on a clothes-horse near the stove . Boor R leads out to back porch ; there are two windows in R wall , one each side of door . Door L to diningroom . At the corner in the rear , L , door opening on back stairs , which ascend to upper parts of the house . Down stage , L , against side wall , a sink and oil-cloth covered drain-board or shelf beside it . In the center of stage a small table covered with oil-cloth . A kitchen chair in corner , down R . When the scene opens , GORDON and LAURA are carrying in soiled dishes through door , L. They come in and out several times , making methodical arrangements for cleaning up . They pile the dishes on the shelf by the sink . Gordon takes dishpan from a hook under the sink , and fills it with hot water from the kettle on the stove . LAURA , who is an attractive little person , aged about twenty-three , is in that slightly tense condition of a young hostess who has had a long and trying day with house and baby , and has also cooked and served a dinner for four .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>All right , Creature , just wait till I light my pipe and we 'll polish this up .<stage>Lights pipe and rolls up shirtsleeves .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p><stage>taking an apron from chair in corner</stage>Put this on first . That 's the only decent pair of trousers you 've got .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>Enter Mrs. Sheffield , carrying dishes .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p>Now you children run along and take it easy . I 'll do all this .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>No , no , mother . You go and talk to Mrs. Johns .<stage>Pointedly .</stage>Do n't let her come in here . mrs. sheff<stage>ultramaternally</stage>Poor baby , she 's tired . You 've been on your feet all day , now let Mother wash up for you . That was a big dinner to cook .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>No tireder than you are , Mother darling . You cooked lunch .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>Both of you clear out ; I can get this done in no time .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p><stage>patting Laura 's cheek</stage>Busy with the baby all afternoon , and then cooking such a delicious dinner — Dearie , wo n't you let Mother do this for you ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>There is n't room in this kitchen for everybody —<stage>Enter Mrs. Johns , carrying dishes .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p>Gordon , you and Laura go and rest . Let the two grandmothers —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>Now listen , little people , this is my job . I always wash up on Thursday evenings —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p>You go and read your newspaper . I can see you 're all fagged out after that long day in the office —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p><stage>to Laura</stage>Please go and lie down , Baby . You 're so tired .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p><stage>with waning patience</stage>You two go and amuse yourselves ; Gordon and I 'll attend to this .<stage>They gently eject the two mothers-in-law .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>Come on , now , the good old system !<stage>He takes the small table from center of stage , and puts it carefully midway between sink and dish cabinet . Takes chair from corner , down R , and sets it beside table . Laura sits down on chair and wipes silverware and dishes as he hands them to her after washing .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>The silver first , while the water 's clean .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>Right . We make a pretty good team at this , do n't we ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p><stage>holds up a small silver jug</stage>That darling old cream jug . Mother used that when she was a little girl .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>I love our little Thursday evening suppers . I think they 're more fun than any other night .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>I 'm glad , Gordie .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>We get better grub on Thursdays , when Ethel goes out , than we ever do when she 's in .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>I tried to have everything specially nice tonight . Some visitors are very critical .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>It was lovely . I 'm afraid it was hard for you , Creature , to have Mother come just now .<stage>A short pause ,</stage>Especially when your Mother was here .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Did n't she know Mother was here ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>No . I had n't told her . You see your Mother is here so much more often . I did n't know your mother would still be here . I was afraid Mother might be a little hurt —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Mother helps me a great deal . I think it 's a queer thing if a wife can n't have her mother stay with her once in a while —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p><stage>aware of danger , changes the subject</stage>Ye Gods , Ethel has cracked the Copenhagen platter .<stage>Laura is silent .</stage>That 's one of the set Mother gave us when we were married .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>It 's a stock pattern . You can get another at any department store .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>I 'll bet that coon did n't empty the icebox pan before she went . I never saw a cook yet who could remember to do that —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>If you had to go out and hunt for them you would n't be so particular . She 's better than no one .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p><stage>goes to icebox and removes a large , brimming pan from under it</stage>What did I tell you !<stage>The water slops over from pan as he carries it gingerly to sink and empties it . He replaces the pan under icebox .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>You 'd better heat some more water . You 've poured that ice-water into the dishpan .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p><stage>getting a little peevish ; refills kettle and puts it on stove</stage>It 's perfectly absurd not having any pantry to keep the icebox in . In here , the heat of the stove melts the ice right away .<stage>Goes back to icebox and slams its doors shut .</stage>Of course , she never keeps the doors properly closed .<stage>He returns to sink and resumes dishwashing .</stage>It 's a funny thing .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>What is ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>Why , that a presumably intelligent coon can n't understand the doors of an icebox are meant to be kept tight shut , to save ice . What does she suppose those little clamps are for ?<stage>Laura is silent . There is a pause , while Gordon scrapes portions of food off the soiled plates . He examines some of these plates rather carefully , and picks out several large pieces of meat , lettuce , butter , etc . which he puts on one plate at one side . Then he seems to resume his good humor and relights his pipe .</stage>Well , it 's jolly to have both the grandmothers here together , is n't it ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Gordon , dear , put the silver away in the sideboard before it gets wet again .<stage>He gathers up silver from the table in front of her and exit L. Laura steps outside door R , and returns , bringing garbage can , which she puts down by the sink . She begins to wash dishes , and sees the plate of odds and ends which Gordon has carefully put to one side . She scrapes its contents into the garbage pail . While she is washings Gordon enter , L .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>Now , Creature , let me do that . You do n't want to spoil those pretty hands .<stage>Takes them , with an attempt to be affectionate .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>I guess it is n't any worse for them than washing the baby 's things .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>Come on , old man , let me .<stage>Gently removes her from sink , and pushes her to the chair by the table . She sits down and wipes dishes as he hands them to her .</stage>It does n't take long when there are two of us .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Gordie , these dishes are n't properly clean . You can n't get that grease off without hot water .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>I guess that kettle 's hot by now .<stage>To stove , feels water in kettle .</stage>Give it a minute longer .<stage>Stands by stove and puffs at his pipe . In a moment of false security , he foolishly reopens a dangerous topic .</stage>You know , I 'm a little worried about Mother .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p><stage>putting away dishes</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Why ?</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>GORDON</l>
     <l>I do n't think she 's as well as usual . She hardly ate any of her salad .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p><stage>turns as though about to say somethings but checks herself and pauses a moment . This time it is she who tries honorably to avert the gathering storm</stage>Oh , Gordie , I forgot to tell you ! Junior drank out of a cup to-day — the first time !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>He did ! The little rascal !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Look , here 's the cup .<stage>Shows a small silver cup .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p><stage>affectionately , putting his arm around her</stage>Well , well .<stage>Looks at cup .</stage>What cup is that ? I do n't seem to remember it —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Why — Mother brought it with her . She used it when she was a baby .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>Where 's that nice old Christening mug of mine ? I think Junior would like to use that once in a while , too .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>I put it away , dear . I was afraid Ethel might dent it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p><stage>takes kettle from stove , goes back to sink</stage>I hope Mother is n't feeling poorly . I noticed at supper —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>When hot meat is served , refined people usually call it dinner —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p><stage>looks at her cautiously , and suddenly seems to realize that they are on the edge of an abyss</stage>Now , honey , you 're tired . You go and rest , I 'll finish up here .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>No , thank you . I like to see that everything gets cleaned up properly . Someone might come snooping out here , and then there 'd be hints about my housekeeping . Of course , I 'll admit I was n't brought up to be a cook —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p><stage>seeks inspiration by relighting his pipe , and takes up a handsome silver coffee pot</stage>One thing I never can make out is , how to prevent coffee grounds from going down the sink .<stage>He talks desperately , trying to tide over the mutually realized danger point .</stage>Perhaps if I could invent some kind of a little coffee-ground strainer I 'd make our fortune . That coffee was delicious , Creature .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Take care of that urn , it 's one of the few handsome things we have .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>It is a beauty .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Jack Davis gave it to me —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p><stage>puts it down with distaste</stage>I guess I 'd better attend to the garbage .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p><stage>nervously</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>It 's all fixed</speaker>
    <p>GORDON I always like Thursdays because that 's the one evening Ethel does n't get a chance to throw away about five dollars ’ worth of good food .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>I fixed the garbage . You can put the pail outside .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p><stage>hunting among plates on the shelf beside sink</stage>Where 's that plate I put here ? There was a lot of perfectly good stuff I saved —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p><stage>blows up at last</stage>Well , if you think I 'm going to keep a lot of halfeaten salad your Mother picked over —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p><stage>seizes garbage pail , lifts it up to the sink and begins to explore its contents . His fuse also is rapidly shortening .</stage>My Lord , it 's no wonder we never have any money to spend if we chuck half of it away in waste .<stage>Picking out various selections .</stage>Waste ! Look at that piece of cheese , and those potatoes . You could take those things , and some of this meat , and make a nice economical hash for lunch —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>It 's a wonder you would n't get a job as a scavenger . I never heard of a husband like you , rummaging through the garbage pail .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p><stage>blows up</stage>Do you know what the one unforgivable sin is ? The sin against the Holy Ghost ? It 's Waste ! It makes me wild to think of working and working like a dog , and half of what I earn just thrown away by an ignorant coon . Look at this , just look at it !<stage>Displays a grisly object .</stage>There 's enough meat on that bone to make soup . And ye gods , here 's that jar of anchovy paste !<stage>Holds it up .</stage>I thought you got that for me as a little treat . I wondered where it had gone to . Why , I had n't eaten more than just the top of it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Well , you left it , and left it , and it got mildewed .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>Scrape it off . A little mildew wo n't hurt anybody . There 'll be mildew on my bank account if this kind of thing goes on .<stage>Still examining garbage pail .</stage>Look here , about half a dozen slices of bread . What 's the matter with them , I 'd like to know .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>I think it 's the most disgusting thing I ever heard of . To go picking over the garbage pail like that . You attend to your affairs and I 'll attend to mine .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>I guess throwing away good , hard-earned money is my affair , is n't it ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>You 're always quick enough to find fault . I know Ethel 's careless , but she 's the best I can get out here in this godforsaken suburb . Maybe you 'll be good enough to find me a better servant . A well-trained girl would n't work in this old dump , where there is n't even gas . You do n't seem to know when you 're lucky . You come back at night and find your home well cared for and me slaving over a hot dinner , and do you ever say a word of thanks ? No , all you can think of is finding fault . I can n't imagine how you were brought up . Your Mother —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>Just leave my mother out of it . I guess she did n't spoil me the way yours did you . Of course , I was n't an only daughter —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>I wish you had been . Then I would n't have married you .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>I suppose you think that if you 'd married Jack Davis or some other of those profiteers you 'd never have had to see the inside of a kitchen —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>If Junior grows up with your disposition , all I can say is , I hope he 'll never get married .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>If he gets married , I hope it 'll be to some girl who understands something about economy —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>If he gets married , I hope he 'll be man enough not to be always finding fault —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>Well , he wo n't get married ! I 'll put him wise to what marriage means , fussing like this all the time —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Yes , he will get married . He shall get married !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>Oh , this is too absurd —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>He shall get married , just to be a humiliating example to his father . I 'll bring him up the way a husband ought to be .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>In handcuffs , I suppose —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>And his wife wo n't have to sit and listen to perpetual criticism from his mother —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>If you 're so down on mothers-in-law , it 's queer you 're anxious to be one yourself . The expectant mother-in-law !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>All right , be vulgar . I dare say you can n't help it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>Great Scott , what did you think marriage was like , anyway ? Did you expect to go through life having everything done for you , without a little hard work to make it interesting ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Is it necessary to shout ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>Now let me tell you something . Let 's see if you can ratify it from your extensive observation of life . Is there anything in the world so cruel as bringing up a girl in absolute ignorance of housework , believing that all her days she 's going to be waited on hand and foot , and that marriage is one long swoon of endearments —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>There 's not much swooning while you 're around .</p>
   </sp>

    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>Why , I believe you actually think your life is wrecked if you are n't being petted and praised every minute . You pretend to think marriage is so sacred and yet you 're buffaloed by a few greasy dishes . I like my kind of sacredness better than yours , and that 's the sacredness of common sense . Marriage ought not to be performed before an altar , but before a kitchen sink .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p><stage>furiously</stage>I ought to have known that oil and water wo n't mix . I ought to have known that a vulgar , selfish , conceited man could n't make a girl happy who was brought up in a refined family . I was a Sheffield , and why I ever became a Johns is more than I can imagine , Johns — I suppose that 's camouflage for Jones . You 're too common , too ordinary , to know when you 're lucky . You get a charming aristocratic wife and expect her to grub along like a washerwoman . You try to crush all the life and spirit out of her . You ought to have married an icebox — that 's the only thing in this house you 're really attentive to .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>Now listen —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p><stage>will not be checked</stage>Talk about being spoiled — why , your Mother babies you so , you think you 're the only man on earth .<stage>Sarcastically .</stage>Her poor , overworked boy , who tries so hard and gets all fagged out in the office and struggles so nobly to support his family ! I wonder how you 'd like to run this house and bear a child and take care of it and shuffle along with an ignorant coon for a maid and then cook a big dinner and be sneered at and never a word of praise . All you can think of is picking over the garbage pail and finding fault —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p><stage>like a fool</stage>I did n't find fault . I found some good food being wasted .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>All right , if you love the garbage pail better than you do your wife , you can live with it .<stage>Flings her dishtowel on the floor and exit , L .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <stage>Gordon stands irresolutely at the sink , and makes a few gloomy motions among the unfinished dishes . He glares at the garbage can . Then he carefully gathers those portions of food that he had chosen as being still usable , contemplates them grimly , then puts them on a plate and , after some hesitation , puts the plate in the icebox . He takes the garbage can and puts it outside door , R. He returns into the kitchen , but then a sudden fit of anger seizes him .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>It 's always the way !</l>
     <stage>Tears off apron , throws it on the floor , and exit R , slamming door .</stage>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <stage>After a brief pause , the door at the rear opening onto the back stairs , is cautiously opened , and Mrs. Sheffield enters quietly . She takes one swift look around the disordered kitchen , picks up dishtowel and apron from the floor , and sets to work rapidly to clean up . Then the back stairs door is again opened in the same stealthy way , and Mrs. Johns enters . The two ladies seem to take each other 's measure with instinctive shrewdness , and fall into a silent , businesslike team-play in putting things to rights . Mrs. Johns takes charge at the sink , and the remaining dishes spin under her capable hands . Mrs. Sheffield takes them from her , rapidly polishes them , and puts them away on the shelves . There is unconscious comedy in the trained precision and labor-saving method of their actions , which are synchronized so that every time Mrs. Johns holds out a washed dish , Mrs. Sheffield is moving back from the cabinet , ready to receive it . They work like automatons , for perhaps two minutes not a word is said , and the two seem , by searching side-glances , to be probing each other 's mood .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p>If it was n't so tragic I 'd laugh .<stage>A pause , during which they work busily .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p>If it was n't so comic I 'd cry .<stage>Another pause .</stage>I guess it 's my fault . Poor Laura , I 'm afraid I have spoiled her .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p>My fault , I think . Two mothers-in-law at once is too much for any young couple . I did n't know you were here , or I would n't have come .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p>Laura is so dreadfully sensitive , poor child —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p>Gordon works so hard at the office . You know he 's trying to get promoted to the sales department , and I suppose it tells on his nerves —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p>If Laura could afford to have a nurse to help her with the baby she would n't get so exhausted —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p>Gordon says he wants to take out some more insurance , that 's why he worries so about economy . It is n't for himself , he 's really very unselfish —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p><stage>a little tartly</stage>Still , I do think that sometimes —<stage>They pause and look at each other quickly .</stage>My gracious , we 'll be at it ourselves if we do n't look out !</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>She goes to the clothes-horse and rearranges the garments on it . She holds up a lilliputian shirt , and they both smile .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p>That darling baby ! I hope he wo n't have poor Gordon 's quick temper . It runs in the Johns family , I 'm afraid . I was an Armstrong before I married Gordon 's father — I did n't know what temper was until I married — either my own or his .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p>I was a Thomson — Thomson without the P , you know , from Rhode Island . All families are hot tempered . All husbands ’ families , anyway .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p>Gordon 's father used to say that Adam and Eve did n't know when they were well off . He said that was why they called it the Garden of Eden .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p>Why ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p>Because there was no mother-in-law there .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p>Poor children , they have such a lot to learn ! I really feel ashamed , Mrs. Johns , because Laura is an undisciplined little thing , and I 'm afraid I 've always petted her too much . She had such a lot of attention before she met Gordon , and was made so much of , it gave her wrong ideas .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p>I wish Gordon was a little younger , I 'd like to turn him up and spank him . He 's dreadfully stubborn and tactless —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p>But I 'm afraid I did make a mistake . Laura was having such a good time as a girl , I was always afraid she 'd have a hard awakening when she married . But Mr. Sheffield had a good deal of money at that time , and he used to say , ‘ She 's only young once , let her enjoy herself . ’</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p>My husband was shortsighted , too . He had had to skimp so , that he brought up Gordon to have a terror of wasting a nickel .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p>Very sensible . I wish Mr. Sheffield had had a little more of that terror . I shall have to tell him what his policy has resulted in . But really , you know , when I heard them at it , I could hardly help admiring them .<stage>With a sigh .</stage>It brings back old times !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p>So it does !<stage>A pause .</stage>But we can n't let them go on like this . A little vigorous quarreling is good for everybody . It 's a kind of spiritual laxative . But they carry it too far .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p>They 're awfully ingenious . They were even bickering about Junior 's future mother-in-law . I suppose she 's still in school , whoever she may be !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p>Being a mother-in-law is almost as painful as being a mother .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p>I think every marriage ought to be preceded by a treaty of peace between the two mothers . If they understand each other , everything will work out all right .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p>You 're right . When each one takes sides with her own child , it 's fatal .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p><stage>lowering her voice</stage>Look here , I think I know how we can make them ashamed of themselves . Where are they now ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p><stage>goes cautiously to door L and peeps through</stage>Laura is lying on the couch in the living-room . I think she 's crying — her face is buried in the cushions .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p>Splendid . That means she 's listening with all her ears —<stage>Tiptoes to window , R .</stage>I can n't see Gordon , but I think he 's walking round the garden —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p><stage>quietly</stage>If we were to talk a little louder he 'd sit on the back steps to hear it —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p>Exactly . Now listen !<stage>They put their heads together and whisper ; the audience does not hear what is said .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p>Fine ! Oh , that 's fine !<stage>Mrs. Sheffield whispers again , inaudible to the spectators .</stage>But wait a moment . Do n't you think it would be better if I praise Laura and you praise Gordon ? They wo n't expect that , and it might shame them —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p>No , no ! Do n't you see —<stage>Whispers again , inaudibly .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p>You 're right . Cunning as serpents and harmless as doves —<stage>They carefully set both doors , L and R ajar .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p>I only hope we wo n't wake the baby —<stage>They return to the task of cleaning up , and talk very loudly in pretended quarrel .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p>Where do these dessert plates go ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p>On this shelf .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p>You 're here so much more often than I , naturally you know Laura 's arrangements better .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p>It 's a lucky thing I am here . I do n't know what poor Laura would do without me at such a dreadful time —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p>Poor Laura ! I should say she 's very fortunate , such a good husband —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p>I think it 's rather sad for a girl who has had as much as she has , to come down to this —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p>It 's perfectly wonderful how Gordon has got on in business —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p>He ought to , with such a lovely home , run like a clock —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p>Yes . An alarm clock .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p>Well , I 'm not going to see my daughter 's happiness ruined —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p>I always knew he 'd make some girl a fine husband —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p>Perhaps . But he seems to have picked the wrong girl . Laura has too much spirit to be bullied —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p>Well , perhaps it was all a mistake . Poor Gordon , he works so hard . I believe his hair is going white over his ears already .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p>Stuff ! That 's lather from where he shaved this morning . He 's too slovenly to wash it off .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p>It is n't right that a young man should have to slave the way he does —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p><stage>apparently in a passion</stage>Do you think that business slavery can compare to household slavery ? I think it 's heartrending to see an attractive girl like Laura shut up in a poky little house doing drudgery and tending a baby . Think of it , having to take care of her own baby ! Why , it 's an outrage . If Gordon was half a man , he 'd get her a trained baby nurse so she would n't have to look at the poor little thing —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p><stage>scathing</stage>Yes , how sad that Gordon should have to entrust his son to amateur care when it needs scientific attention .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p>Poor darling Laura — she never ought to have had a baby .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p>Gordon is too intellectual to be bothered with these domestic details . He ought to be able to concentrate on his work .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p><stage>coming close to Mrs. Johns , feigning great rage , but grimacing to show it is merely acting</stage>Well , if you do n't think my daughter is good enough for your son , I can always take her home with me . I guess I can find room for her , and we can put the child in an institution .<stage>Both nearly laughs but recover themselves .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p>Do n't worry . I 'll take the child . He 's a Johns anyway , not a Sheffield . And you just watch Gordon , when he 's relieved of all this family worry and quarreling . He 'll make his mark in the world . He 's too fine to be tied down by a wife that does n't understand him .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p>Oh , how happy Laura will be to hear this . My sweet , clever , attractive , economical , sensible little girl , free at last . Her married life has been a nightmare . That great , hulking , selfish man has tried to trample all the joy out of her . He sha n't do it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p>I never heard of a young husband as self-sacrificing as Gordon . I do n't believe he ever goes out for an evening with other men , and he never spends anything on himself —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p>I think the way Laura runs her little home is just wonderful . See how she struggles to keep her kitchen in order — this miserable , inconvenient little kitchen , no gas , no pantry , no decent help . I think it 's terrible she has had to put up with so much —<stage>They pause , and listen at the door , L. The kitchen is now spick and span . Mrs. Johns makes a gesture to indicate that Laura is taking it all in , offstage .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p>Well , then , it 's all settled .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p>Yes . As Laura 's mother , I can n't let her go on like this . A husband , a home , and a baby — it 's enough to ruin any woman .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. JOHNS</speaker>
    <p>It 's only fair to both sides to end it all . I never heard of such brutal hardships . Gordon can n't fight against these things any longer . Throwing away a soupbone and three slices of bread ! I wonder he does n't go mad .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MRS. SHEFF</speaker>
    <p>We 've saved them just in time .<stage>They look at each other knowingly , with the air of those who have done a sound bit of work , Then they stealthily open the door at the rear , and exeunt up the back stairs ,</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <stage>There is a brief pause ; then the door L opens like an explosion , and Laura bursts in , She stands for a moment , wild-eyed , stamps her foot in a passion , Then she seizes one of the baby shirts from the rack , and drops into the chair by the table , crying . She buries her head in her arms , concealing the shirt , Enter Gordon , R , He stands uncertainly , evidently feeling like a fool .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>I 'm sorry , I — I left my pipe in here .<stage>Finds it by the sink ,</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p><stage>her face still hidden</stage>Oh , Gordie , was it all a mistake ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p><stage>troubled , pats her shoulder tentatively</stage>Now listen , Creature , do n't . You 'll make yourself sick .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>I never thought I 'd hear such things — from my own mother .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>I never heard such rot . They must be mad , both of them .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Then you were listening , too —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>Yes . Why , they 're deliberately trying to set us against each other .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>They would n't have dared speak like that if they had known we could hear . Gordon , I do n't think it 's legal —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>I 'm afraid the law does n't give one much protection against one 's mothers .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p><stage>miserably</stage>I guess she 's right . I am spoiled , and I am silly , and I am extravagant —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>Do n't be silly , darling . That 's crazy stuff . I 'm not overworked , and even if I were I 'd love it , for you —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>I do n't want a nurse for Junior . I would n't have one in the house .<stage>Sits up , dishevelled , and displays the small shirt she has been clutching .</stage>Gordon , I 'm not an amateur ! I love that baby and I am scientific . I keep a chart of his weight every week .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>Yes , I know , ducky , Gordon understands . Soon we 'll be able to buy that scales you want , and we wo n't have to weigh him on the meat balance .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Nobody can take away my darling baby —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>It was my fault , dear . I am obstinate and disagreeable —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>I 'll speak to Ethel about the garbage —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>Ethel 's all right . We 're lucky to have her .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Gordon , you must n't work too hard . You know you 're all I have —<stage>A sob .</stage>since Mother 's gone back on me .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p><stage>patting her</stage>I think it 's frightful , the things they said . What are they trying to do , break up a happy home ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>We are happy , are n't we ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>Well , I should say so . Did you ever hear me complain ?<stage>Takes her in his arms .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>No , Gordie . It was cruel of them to try to make trouble between us — but , perhaps , some of the things they said —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>Were true ?—</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Well , not exactly true , dear , but — interesting ! — your mother is right , you do have a hard time , and I 'll try —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p><stage>stops her</stage>No , your mother is right . I 've been a brute —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>I 'm lucky to have such a husband —<stage>They are silent a moment .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>I suppose you 'll think it an awful anticlimax —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>What , dear ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>Suppose we have something to eat ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p><stage>happily</stage>Good idea . Quarreling always makes me hungry .<stage>They go to the icebox .</stage>I did n't really get any supper to speak of , I was worrying about everything so —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p><stage>opening icebox</stage>You mean dinner , honey — among refined people !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>Do n't be a tease . Come on , we 'll have a snack —<stage>She discovers Gordon s plate of left-overs .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>Throw out that junk — I was idiotic to save it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p>No , Gordie , you were quite right . We must save everything we can . Four or five heads of lettuce would make a new shirt for Junior .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p><stage>bewildered</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Lettuce ?</speaker>
    <p>LAURA I mean , if we saved that much , it would make enough money to buy him a new little vest . He 's getting so enormous —<stage>She puts plate of left-overs on the table , with some other cold food .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>There , now , this is better .<stage>They sit down at table .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>LAURA</speaker>
    <p><stage>thoughtfully</stage>You know , Gordie , we must n't let them know we heard them .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>GORDON</speaker>
    <p>No , I suppose not . But it 's hard to forgive that sort of talk .</p>
   </sp>
