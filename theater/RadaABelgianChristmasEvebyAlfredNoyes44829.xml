    <speaker>DEDICATION</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Thou whose deep ways are in the sea ,</l>
     <l>Whose footsteps are not known ,</l>
     <l>To-night a world that turned from Thee</l>
     <l>Is waiting — at Thy Throne .</l>
     <l>The towering Babels that we raised</l>
     <l>Where scoffing sophists brawl ,</l>
     <l>The little Antichrists we praised —</l>
     <l>The night is on them all .</l>
     <l>The fool hath said ... The fool hath said ...</l>
     <l>And we , who deemed him wise ,</l>
     <l>We , who believed that Thou wast dead ,</l>
     <l>How should we seek Thine eyes ?</l>
     <l>How should we seek to Thee for power ,</l>
     <l>Who scorned Thee yesterday ?</l>
     <l>How should we kneel in this dread hour ?</l>
     <l>Lord , teach us how to pray .</l>
     <l>Grant us the single heart once more</l>
     <l>That mocks no sacred thing ,</l>
     <l>The Sword of Truth our fathers wore</l>
     <l>When Thou wast Lord and King .</l>
     <l>Let darkness unto darkness tell</l>
     <l>Our deep unspoken prayer ;</l>
     <l>For , while our souls in darkness dwell ,</l>
     <l>We know that Thou art there .</l>

    <lg>
     <l>Under which banner ? It was night</l>
     <l>Beyond all nights that ever were .</l>
     <l>The Cross was broken . Blood-stained Might</l>
     <l>Moved like a tiger from its lair ,</l>
     <l>And all that heaven had died to quell</l>
     <l>Awoke , and mingled earth with hell .</l>
     <l>For Europe , if it held a creed ,</l>
     <l>Held it thro ’ custom , not thro ’ faith .</l>
     <l>Chaos returned in dream and deed ,</l>
     <l>Right was a legend — Love , a wraith ;</l>
     <l>And That from which the world began</l>
     <l>Was less than even the best in man .</l>
     <l>God in the image of a snake</l>
     <l>Dethroned that dream , too fond , too blind ,</l>
     <l>The man-shaped God whose heart could break ,</l>
     <l>Live , die and triumph with mankind ;</l>
     <l>A Super-snake , a Juggernaut ,</l>
     <l>Dethroned the Highest of human thought .</l>
     <l>Choose , England ! For the eternal foe</l>
     <l>Within thee , as without , grew strong ,</l>
     <l>By many a super-subtle blow</l>
     <l>Blurring the lines of right and wrong</l>
     <l>In Art and Thought , till nought seemed true</l>
     <l>But that soul-slaughtering cry of New !</l>
     <l>New wreckage of the shrines we made</l>
     <l>Thro ’ centuries of forgotten tears ....</l>
     <l>We knew not where their hands had laid</l>
     <l>Our Master . Twice a thousand years</l>
     <l>Had dulled the uncapricious sun .</l>
     <l>Manifold worlds obscured the One ;</l>
     <l>Obscured the reign of Law , our stay ,</l>
     <l>Our compass thro ’ the uncharted sea ,</l>
     <l>The one sure light , the one sure way ,</l>
     <l>The one firm base of Liberty ;</l>
     <l>The one firm road that men have trod</l>
     <l>Thro ’ Chaos to the Throne of God .</l>
     <l>Choose ye ! A hundred legions cried</l>
     <l>Dishonour , or the instant sword !</l>
     <l>Ye chose . Ye met that blood-stained tide ,</l>
     <l>A little kingdom kept its word ;</l>
     <l>And , dying , cried across the night ,</l>
     <l>Hear us , O earth , we chose the Right .</l>
     <l>Whose is the victory ? Though ye stood</l>
     <l>Alone against the unmeasured foe ,</l>
     <l>By all the tears , by all the blood ,</l>
     <l>That flowed , and have not ceased to flow ,</l>
     <l>By all the legions that ye hurled</l>
     <l>Back thro ’ the thunder-shaken world ;</l>
     <l>By the old that have not where to rest ,</l>
     <l>By lands laid waste and hearths defiled ,</l>
     <l>By every lacerated breast ,</l>
     <l>And every mutilated child ,</l>
     <l>Whose is the victory ? Answer , ye</l>
     <l>Who , dying , smiled at tyranny :—</l>
     <l>Under the sky 's triumphal arch</l>
     <l>The glories of the dawn begin .</l>
     <l>Our dead , our shadowy armies , march</l>
     <l>E'en now , in silence , thro ’ Berlin —</l>
     <l>Dumb shadows , tattered blood-stained ghosts ,</l>
     <l>But cast by what swift following hosts !</l>
     <l>And answer , England ! At thy side ,</l>
     <l>Thro ’ seas of blood , thro ’ mists of tears ,</l>
     <l>Thou that for Liberty hast died</l>
     <l>And livest , to the end of years .</l>
     <l>And answer , earth ! Far off , I hear</l>
     <l>The paeans of a happier sphere :—</l>
     <l>The trumpet blown at Marathon</l>
     <l>Exulted over earth and sea ;</l>
     <l>But burning angel lips have blown</l>
     <l>The trumpets of thy Liberty ,</l>
     <l>For who , beside thy dead , could deem</l>
     <l>The faith , for which they died , a dream ?</l>
     <l>Earth has not been the same , since then .</l>
     <l>Europe from thee received a soul ,</l>
     <l>Whence nations moved in law , like men ,</l>
     <l>As members of a mightier whole ,</l>
     <l>Till wars were ended .... In that day ,</l>
     <l>So shall our children 's children say .</l>

   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NANKO</speaker>
    <p>, an old , half-witted schoolmaster , living in the care of the doctor . He has a delusion that it is always Christmas Eve . German soldiers .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>RADA</speaker>
    <p>A BELGIAN CHRISTMAS EVE The action takes place in a Belgian village , during the War of 1914 . The scene is a room in the doctor 's house . On the right there is a door opening to the street , a window with red curtains , and a desk under the window . On the left there is a large cupboard with a door on either side of it , one leading to a bedroom and the other to the kitchen . At the back an open fire is burning brightly . Over the fireplace there is a reproduction in colours of the Dresden Madonna . The room is lit only by the firelight and two candles in brass candlesticks , on a black oak table , at which the two soldiers are seated , playing cards and drinking beer .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>RADA</speaker>
    <p>, a dark handsome woman , sits on a couch to the left of the fire , with her head bowed in her hands , weeping .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NANKO</speaker>
    <p>sits cross-legged on a rug before the fire , rubbing his hands , snapping his fingers , and chuckling to himself .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TARRASCH</speaker>
    <p><stage>throwing down the cards</stage>Pish ! You have all the luck .<stage>He turns to RADA</stage>Look here , my girl , where is the use of snivelling ? We 've been killing pigs all day and now we want to unbuckle a bit . You ought to think yourself infernally lucky to be alive at all , and I 'm not sure that you will be so fortunate when the other boys come back . Wheedled them out of the house finely , did n't you ? On a fine wildgoose chase , too . Hidden money ! Refugees do n't bury their money and leave the secret behind them . You 've been whimpering ever since we two refused to believe you . What 's your game , eh ? I warn you there 'll be hell to pay when they come back .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>RADA</speaker>
    <p><stage>sobbing and burying her face</stage>God , be pitiful !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TARRASCH</speaker>
    <p>This is war , this is ! And you can n't expect war to be all swans and shining armour . No — nor smart uniforms either . Look at the mud my friend and I have already annexed from Belgium . Brander , you know it 's a most astonishing fact ; but I have remarked it several times . Those women whose eyes glitter at the sight of a spiked helmet are the first to be astonished by the realities of war . They expect the dead to jump up and kiss them and tell them it is all a game , as soon as the battle is ended . No , no , my dear ; it 's only in war that one sees how small is one 's personal happiness in comparison with greater things . Is n't it ?</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>He fills a glass and drinks . BRANDER lights a cigar .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NANKO</speaker>
    <p>Exactly . In times of peace we forget those eternal silences . We value life too highly . We become domesticated . Why , I suppose in this magnificent war there have been so many women and children killed that they would fill the great Cloth Hall at Ypres ; and , as for the young men , there have been so many slaughtered that their dead bodies would fill St. Peter 's at Rome . Why , I suppose they would fill the three hundred abbeys of Flanders and all the cathedrals in the world chock-full from floor to belfry , would n't they ? How Goya would have loved to paint them ! Ca n't you see it ?<stage>He grows ecstatic over the idea .</stage>Tournai with its five clock-towers , Ghent , and Bruges , Louvain and Antwerp , Rheims and Westminster , Under the round white moon , on Christmas Eve , With towers of frozen needlework , and spires That point to God ; but all their painted panes Bursting with dreadful arms and gaping faces , Gargoyles of flesh ; and round them , in the snow , The little cardinals , like gouts of blood , The little bishops , running like white mice , Hooded with violet spots , quite , quite dismayed To find there was no room for them within Upon that holy night when Christ was born . But perhaps if Goya were living to-day he would prefer to pack them into Chicago meat factories , with the intellectuals dancing outside like marionettes , and the unconscious Hand of God pulling the strings . You know one of their very latest theories is that He is a somnambulist .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TARRASCH</speaker>
    <p><stage>to RADA</stage>You should read Schopenhauer , my dear , and learn to estimate these emotions at their true value . You would then be able to laugh at these feelings which seem to you now so important . It is the mark of Kultur to be able to laugh at all sentiments . Is n't it ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NANKO</speaker>
    <p>The priests , I suppose , are still balancing themselves on the tight-rope , over the jaws of the crowd . The poor old Pope did his best for his Master , when the Emperor asked him for a blessing on the war . “ I bless Peace , ” said the Pope ; but nobody listened . I composed a little poem about that . I called it St. Peter 's Christmas . It went like this :— And does the Cross of Christ still stand ? Yes , though His friends may watch from far — And who is this at His right hand , This Rock in the red surf of war ? This , this is he who once denied , And turned and wept and turned again . Last night before an Emperor 's pride He stood and blotted out that stain . Last night an Emperor bared the sword And bade him bless . He stood alone . Alone in all the world , his word Confessed — and blessed — a loftier throne . I hear , still travelling towards the Light , In widening waves till Time shall cease , The Power that breathed from Rome last night His infinite whisper — I bless Peace .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>TARRASCH and BRANDER applaud ironically .</stage>
   <stage>Illustration : OVER THE JAWS OF THE CROWD</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TARRASCH</speaker>
    <p>Excellent ! Excellent !<stage>To RADA</stage>You should have seen our brave soldiers laughing — do you remember , Brander — at a little village near Termonde . They made the old vicar and his cook dance naked round the dead body of his wife , who had connived at the escape of her daughter from a Prussian officer .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NANKO</speaker>
    <p>Ah , that was reality , was n't it ? None of your provincial respectability about that , none of your shallow conventionality ! That 's what the age wants — realism !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TARRASCH</speaker>
    <p>It was brutal , I confess ; but better than British hypocrisy , eh ? There was something great about it , like the neighing of the satyrs in the Venusberg music .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>RADA</speaker>
    <p><stage>sinking on her knees by the couch and sobbing</stage>God ! God !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TARRASCH</speaker>
    <p>They were beginning to find out the provincialism of their creeds in England . The pessimism of Schopenhauer had taught them much ; and if it had not been for this last treachery , this last ridiculous outburst of the middle-class mind on behalf of what they call honour , we should have continued to tolerate<stage>if not to enjoy</stage>, in Berlin , those plays by Irishmen which expose so wittily the inferior Kultur , the shrinking from reality , of their<stage>for the most part</stage>not intellectual people . I have the honour , madam , to request that you should no longer make this unpleasant sound of weeping . You irritate my nerves . Have you not two men quartered upon you instead of one ? And are they not university students ? If your husband and the rest of the villagers had not resisted our advance , they might have been alive , too . In any case , your change is for the better . Is n't it ?</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>He lights a cigar .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NANKO</speaker>
    <p>Exactly ! Exactly ! You remember , Rada , I used to be a schoolmaster myself in the old days ; and if you knew what I know , you would n't cry , my dear . You 'd understand that it 's entirely a question of the survival of the fittest . A biological necessity , that 's what it is . And Haeckel himself has told us that , though we may resign our hopes of immortality , and the grave is the only future for our beloved ones , yet there is infinite consolation to be found in examining a piece of moss or looking at a beetle . That 's what the Germans call the male intellect .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TARRASCH</speaker>
    <p>Is this man attempting to be insolent ?</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>He rises as if to strike NANKO .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>BRANDER</speaker>
    <p><stage>tapping his forehead</stage>Take no notice of him . He 's only a resident patient . He was not calling you a beetle . He has delusions . He thinks it is always Christmas Eve . That 's his little tree in the corner . As Goethe should have said — There was a little Christian . He had a little tree . Up came a Superman And cracked him , like a flea .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TARRASCH</speaker>
    <p><stage>laughing</stage>Very good ! You should send that to the Tageblatt , Brander . Well , Rada , or whatever your name is , you 'd better find something for us to eat . I 'm sick of this whimpering . Would n't your Belgian swine have massacred us all , if we 'd given them the chance ? We 've thousands of women and children at home snivelling and saying , “ Oh ! my God ! Oh ! my God ! ” just like you .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>RADA</speaker>
    <p><stage>rising to her feet in a fury of contempt</stage>Then why are you in Belgium , gentlemen ? Is it the husks and chaff that the swine eat , Or is it simply butchery ?<stage>They stare at her in silence , over-mastered for a moment by her passion . Then , her grief welling up again , she casts herself down on the couch , and buries her face in her hands , sobbing .</stage>God ! God ! God !</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>Illustration : THE OLD DANCE OF CHARLATANS AND BEASTS</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>BRANDER</speaker>
    <p>Do n't you trouble about God . What can He do when both sides go down on their marrow-bones ? He can n't make both sides win , can He ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NANKO</speaker>
    <p>That 's how the intellectuals prove He does n't exist . Either He is not almighty , they say , or else He is unjust enough not to make both sides win . But all those anthropomorphic conceptions are out of date now , even in England , as this gentleman very truly said . You see , it was so degrading , Rada , to think that God had anything in common with mankind<stage>though love was once quite fashionable</stage>, and as we did n't know of anything higher than ourselves we were simply compelled to say that He resembled something lower , such as earthquakes , and tigers , and puppet-shows , and ideas of that sort . Reality above all things ! You may see God in sunsets ; but there was nothing real about the best qualities of mankind . It 's curious . The more intellectual and original you are , the lower you have to go , and the more likely you are to end in the old dance of charlatans and beasts . I suppose that 's an argument for tradition and growth . If we call it Evolution , nobody will mind very much .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>RADA</speaker>
    <p><stage>wringing her hands in an agony of grief</stage>Oh , God , be pitiful , be pitiful !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>BRANDER</speaker>
    <p><stage>standing in front of her</stage>Look here , we 've had enough of this music . I 've been watching you , and there 's more upon your mind than sorrow for the dead . Why were you so anxious to wheedle us all out of the house ? Tarrasch has warned you there 'll be hell to pay when the others come back . What was the game , eh ? You 'd better tell me . You could n't have thought you were going to escape through our lines to-night .<stage>There is a sudden uproar outside , and a woman 's scream , followed by the terrified cry of a child .</stage>Ah ! Ah ! Father !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>BRANDER</speaker>
    <p>Hear that . The men are mad with brandy and blood and — other things . There 's no holding them in , even from the children . You need n't wince . Even from the children , I say . What chance would there be for a fine-looking wench like yourself ? No , you were not going to try that . You 've something to hide , here , in the house , eh ? Well , now you 've got rid of the others , and we 've had a drink , we 're going to look for it . What is there ?</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>He points to the bedroom door .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>RADA</speaker>
    <p><stage>rising to her feet slowly , steadying herself with one hand on the couch and fixing her eyes on his face</stage>My bedroom . No . I 've nothing here to hide . This is war , is n't it ? If I choose to revenge myself on those that have used me badly , people that I hate , by telling you where you can find what everybody wants , money , money — I suppose you want that — is n't that good enough ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>BRANDER</speaker>
    <p>Better come with us , then , and show us this treasure-trove .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>RADA</speaker>
    <p><stage>shrinking back</stage>No , no , I dare not . All those dead out there would terrify me , terrify me !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TARRASCH</speaker>
    <p>A pack of lies ! What were you up to , eh ? Telephoning to the English ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>BRANDER</speaker>
    <p>It has been too much for her nerves . Do n't worry her , or she 'll go mad . Then there 'll be nobody left to get us our supper .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>TARRASCH wanders round the room , opening drawers and examining letters and other contents at the desk .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NANKO</speaker>
    <p>That would be selfish , Rada . You know it 's Christmas Eve . Nobody ought to think of unpleasant things on Christmas Eve . What have you done with the Christmas-tree , Rada ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>BRANDER</speaker>
    <p>And who 's to blame ? That 's what I want to know . You do n't blame us , do you ? We did n't know where we were marching a month ago ; and possibly we shall be fighting on your side against somebody else , a year hence .</p>

    <p><stage>who has been watching him curiously</stage>I know . You are the British . Mother said The British would be here before the Boches . I dreamed that you were coming , and I thought I heard the marching . Were n't you singing , too ? It made me feel so happy in my sleep . What were you singing ? “ It 's a long , long way To —— ” what d'you call it ? Tipperary ? eh ? What does that mean ?</p>
   </sp>

    <speaker>BETTINE</speaker>
    <p>Well , I suppose it means the Boches must march A long , long way before they reach it , eh ? There 's Canada . They 'll have to march through that . Then India , and that 's huge . Why , Nanko says There are three hundred million people there , And all their soldiers ride on elephants . Poor Boches ! I 'm sorry for them . Nanko says They 're trying to ride across two thousand years In motor-cars . It 's easy enough to ride Two thousand miles ; but not two thousand years .<stage>She runs to the stocking and examines it . TARRASCH and BRANDER return to the table and eat and drink .</stage>There 's nothing in the stocking . Never mind , Nanko , when Christmas really comes , you 'll see .<stage>With a sudden note of fear in her voice .</stage>Mother , where 's father ?</p>

    <speaker>NANKO</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Now , what a wonderful man the doctor was !</l>
     <l>Nobody else , in these parts , would have thought</l>
     <l>Of buying a gramophone . Let 's open it .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>BETTINE</speaker>
    <p>Yes ! Yes ! And we 'll give father a surprise ! It shall be playing a tune when he comes in ! He wo n't be angry , will he , mumsy dear ?</p>

   <stage>BRANDER opens the package . NANKO rubs his hands in delight . They get the gramophone ready .</stage>

    <speaker>NANKO</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Oh , this will be a merry Christmas Eve .</l>
     <l>There now — just see how this kind gentleman</l>
     <l>Has opened the package for us . Now you see</l>
     <l>The good of war . It benefits the health .</l>
     <l>Sets a man up . Look at old Peter 's legs ,</l>
     <l>He 's a disgrace to the village , a disgrace !</l>
     <l>Nobody shoots him either , so he spoils</l>
     <l>Everything ; for you know , you must admit ,</l>
     <l>Bettine , that war means natural selection —</l>
     <l>Survival of the fittest , do n't you see ?</l>
     <l>For instance , I survive , and you survive :</l>
     <l>Do n't we ? So Peter should n't spoil it all .</l>
     <l>They say that all the tall young men in France</l>
     <l>Were killed in the Napoleonic wars ,</l>
     <l>So that most Frenchmen at the present day</l>
     <l>Are short and fat . Is n't that funny , Bettine ?</l>
     <stage>She laughs .</stage>
     <l>Which shows us that tall men are not required</l>
     <l>To-day . So nobody knows . Perhaps thin legs</l>
     <l>Like Peter 's may be useful , after all ,</l>
     <l>In aeroplanes , or something . Every ounce</l>
     <l>Makes a great difference there . Nobody knows .</l>
     <l>It 's natural selection . See , Bettine ?</l>
     <l>Ah , now the gramophone 's ready . Make it play</l>
     <l>A Christmas tune . That 's what the churches do</l>
     <l>On Christmas Eve : for all the churches now ,</l>
     <l>And all the tall cathedrals with their choirs ,</l>
     <l>What do you think they are , Bettine ? I 'll tell you .</l>
     <l>I 'll whisper it . They 're great big gramophones !</l>
     <stage>She laughs .</stage>
     <l>Now for a Christmas tune !</l>

   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TARRASCH</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Better keep quiet</l>
     <l>Till morning . When the men have slept it off</l>
     <l>They 'll stand a better chance of slipping away .</l>

     <l>Oh , what a pity ! I did think , Bettine ,</l>
     <l>That we should have some music . Well — I know !</l>
     <l>Tell us the Christmas piece you learned in school .</l>
     <l>That 's right . Stand there ! No , stand up on this bench .</l>
     <l>Your mother tells me that you won the prize</l>
     <l>For learning it so beautifully , Bettine .</l>
     <l>That 's right . Now , while you say it , I will stand</l>
     <l>Here , with a candle . See , that illustrates</l>
     <l>The scene .</l>
     <stage>He lifts one of the candles to illuminate the picture of the Madonna and child . For a moment he speaks with a curious dignity .</stage>
     <l>You know it is not all delusion</l>
     <l>About this Christmas Eve . The wise men say</l>
     <l>That Time is a delusion . Now then , speak</l>

    <speaker>BETTINE</speaker>
    <p><stage>with her hands behind her , as if in school , she obeys him</stage>She laid Him in a manger , because there was no room for them in the inn . And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field , keeping watch over their flock by night , And lo , the angel of the Lord came upon them , and the glory of the Lord shone round about them , and they were sore afraid . And the angel said unto them , “ Fear not : for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy , which shall be to all people . “ For unto you is born this day in the City of David a Saviour , which is Christ the Lord . “ And this shall be a sign unto you ; ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes , lying in a manger . ” And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host , praising God , and saying :— “ Glory to God in the Highest , and on earth peace .... ”</p>

    <speaker>TARRASCH</speaker>
    <p>The British ! A night-attack ! ( They all rush out except NANKO , who peers after them from the door . Leaving it open to the night , he takes a marron glace from the table , crosses the room , and begins to examine the gramophone . Confused sounds of men rushing to arms , thin bugle-calls in the distance , and the occasional clatter of a galloping horse blow in from the blackness framed in the open door . The deep pulsation of the British artillery is heard throughout , in a steady undertone . )</p>

    <p><stage>calling aloud as he munches</stage>Come , Rada , you 're pretending . They 're all gone . Rada , these marrons glaces are delicious . It 's over now ! Come , I do n't think it 's right To spoil a person 's pleasure on Christmas Eve .<stage>He tiptoes to the door and peers into the night .</stage>Come quick , Bettine , rockets are going up ! They are breaking into clusters of green stars ! Oh , there 's a red one ! You could see for miles When that one broke . The willow-trees jumped out Like witches ; and , between them , the canal Dwindled away to a little thread of blood . And there were lines of men running and falling , And guns and horses floundering in a ditch . Oh , Rada ! there 's a bonfire by the mill . They 've burned the little cottage . There 's a man Hanging above the bonfire by his hands , And heaps of dead all round him . Come and see ! It 's terrible , but it 's magnificent , Like one of Goya 's pictures . That 's the way He painted war . Well , everybody 's gone .... To think I was the fittest , after all !<stage>He returns to the gramophone .</stage>I wonder how this gramophone does work . He said the tune that he was putting in Was just the thing for Christmas Eve . I wonder , I wonder what it was . Listen to this !<stage>He reads the title .</stage>It 's a good omen , Rada — A Christmas carol Sung by the Grand Imperial Choir — d ’ you hear ?— At midnight in St. Petersburg — Adeste Fideles ! Fancy that ! A Christmas carol Upon the gramophone ! So all the future ages will be sure To know exactly what religion was . To think we must not hear it ! Rada , they say The Angel Gabriel composed that tune On the first Christmas Eve . So do n't you think That we might hear it ? Everybody is gone , except the dead . It will not wake them .... Come , Rada , you 're pretending ! Do not make The war more dreadful than it really is .<stage>He accidentally sets the gramophone working and jumps back , a little alarmed . He runs to the bedroom door .</stage>Rada ! I 've started it ! Bettine , d ’ you hear ? The gramophone 's working .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>The artillery booms like a thunder-peal in the distance . Then the gramophone drowns it with the massed voices of the Imperial Choir singing :</stage>

    <p>Something red again ? Trickling under the door ? Blood , I suppose ....<stage>A look of horror comes into his face as he stands listening to the music . Then , as if slowly waking from a dream and almost as if sanity had returned for a moment , he cries :</stage>It 's true ! It 's true ! Rada , I am awake ! I am awake ! And , in the name of Christ , I accuse , I accuse ... O God , forgive us all !<stage>He falls on his knees by the bedroom door and calls , as if to the dead within :</stage>Awake , and after nineteen hundred years .... Bettine , Bettine ! the British , they are coming ! Rada , you said it — they are coming quickly ! They are coming , with the reign of right and law . But , O Bettine ! Bettine ! will they remember ? Are they awake ? I only hear their guns . What if they should grow used to it , Bettine , And fail to wipe this horror from the world ? God , is there any hope for poor mankind ? God , are Thy little nations and Thy weak , Thine innocent , condemned to hell for ever ? God , will the strong deliverers break the sword And bring this world at last to Christmas Eve ?</p>
