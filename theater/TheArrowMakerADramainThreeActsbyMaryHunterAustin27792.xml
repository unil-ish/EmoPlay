    <head>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION</head>
    <p n="1">The greatest difficulty to be met in the writing of an Indian play is the extensive misinformation about Indians . Any real aboriginal of my acquaintance resembles his prototype in the public mind about as much as he does the high-nosed , wooden sign of a tobacco store , the fact being that , among the fifty-eight linguistic groups of American aboriginals , customs , traits , and beliefs differ as greatly as among Slavs and Sicilians . Their very speech appears not to be derived from any common stock . All that they really have of likeness is an average condition of primitiveness : they have traveled just so far toward an understanding of the world they live in , and no farther . It is this general limitation of knowledge which makes , in spite of the multiplication of tribal customs , a common attitude of mind which alone affords a basis of interpretation .</p>
    <p n="2">But before attempting to realize the working of Indian psychology , you must first rid yourself of the notion that there is any real difference between the tribes of men except the explanations . What determines man 's behavior in the presence of fever , thunder , and the separations of death , is the nature of his guess at the causes of these things . The issues of life do not vary so much with the conditions of civilization as is popularly supposed .</p>
    <p n="3">Chiefest among the misconceptions of primitive life , which make difficult any dramatic presentation of it , is the notion that all human contacts are accompanied by the degree of emotional stress that obtains only in the most complex social organizations . We are always hearing , from the people farthest removed from them , of “ great primitive passions ,” when in fact what distinguishes the passions of the tribesmen from our own is their greater liability to the pacific influences of nature , and their greater freedom from the stimulus of imagination . What among us makes for the immensity of emotion , is the great weight of accumulated emotional tradition stored up in literature and art , almost entirely wanting in the camps of the aboriginals . There the two greatest themes of modern drama , love and ambition , are modified , the one by the more or less communal nature of tribal labor , the other by the plain fact that in the simple , open-air life of the Indian the physical stress of sex is actually much less than in conditions called civilized .</p>
    <p n="4">When the critics are heard talking of “ drama of great primitive passions ,” what they mean is great barbaric passions , passions far enough along in the process of socialization to be subject to the interactions of wealth , caste , and established religion , and still free from the obligation of politeness . But the life of the American Indian provides no such conditions , and , moreover , in the factor which makes conspicuously for the degree of complication called Plot , is notably wanting ,— I mean in the factor of Privacy . Where all the functions of living are carried on in the presence of the community , or at the best behind the thin-walled , leafy huts , human relations become simplified to a degree difficult for our complexer habit to comprehend . The only really great passions — great , I mean , in the sense of being dramatically possible — are communal , and find their expression in the dance which is the normal vehicle of emotional stress .</p>
    <p n="5">In The Arrow-Maker the author , without dwelling too much on tribal peculiarities , has attempted the explication of this primitive attitude toward a human type common to all conditions of society . The particular mould in which the story is cast takes shape from the manner of aboriginal life in the Southwest , anywhere between the Klamath River and the Painted Desert ; but it has been written in vain if the situation has not also worked itself out in terms of your own environment .</p>
    <p n="6">The Chisera is simply the Genius , one of those singular and powerful characters whom we are still , with all our learning , unable to account for without falling back on the primitive conception of gift as arising from direct communication with the gods . That she becomes a Medicine Woman is due to the circumstance of being born into a time which fails to discriminate very clearly as to just which of the inexplicable things lie within the control of her particular gift . That she accepts the interpretation of her preëminence which common opinion provides for her , does not alter the fact that she is no more or less than just the gifted woman , too much occupied with the use of her gift to look well after herself , and more or less at the mercy of the tribe . What chiefly influences their attitude toward her is worthy of note , being no less than the universal , unreasoned conviction that great gift belongs , not to the possessor of it , but to society at large . The whole question then becomes one of how the tribe shall work the Chisera to their best advantage .</p>
    <p n="7">How they did this , with what damage and success is to be read , but if to be read profitably , with its application in mind to the present social awakening to the waste , the enormous and stupid waste , of the gifts of women . To one fresh from the consideration of the roots of life as they lie close to the surface of primitive society , this obsession of the recent centuries , that the community can only be served by a gift for architecture , for administration , for healing , when it occurs in the person of a male , is only a trifle less ridiculous than that other social stupidity , namely , that a gift of mothering must not be exercised except in the event of a particular man being able , under certain restrictions , to afford the opportunity . There is perhaps no social movement going on at present so deep-rooted and dramatic as this struggle of Femininity to recapture its right to serve , and still to serve with whatever powers and possessions it finds itself endowed . But a dramatic presentation of it is hardly possible outside of primitive conditions where no tradition intervenes to prevent society from accepting the logic of events .</p>
    <p n="8">Whatever more there may be in The Arrow-Maker , besides its Indian color , should lie in the discovery by the Chisera , to which the author subscribes , that it is also in conjunction with her normal relation for loving and bearing that the possessor of gifts finds the greatest increment of power . To such of these as have not discovered it for themselves , The Arrow-Maker is hopefully recommended .</p>
    <p n="9">NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION</p>
   </div>
   <titlePage>
    <docImprint>The Arrow-Maker was first published as produced at The New Theatre ,<settlement>New York</settlement>, in the spring of<date>1911</date>. In that edition certain concessions were made to what was thought to be the demand for a drama of Indian life which should present the Indian more nearly as he is popularly conceived . After four years the success of the published play as an authentic note on aboriginal life as well as a drama suitable for production in schools and colleges , seems to warrant its publication in the original form . As it now stands , the book not only conforms to the author 's original conception of the drama , but to the conditions of the life it presents . With the addition of notes and glossary it is hoped the present edition will meet every demand that can be made on an honest attempt to render in dramatic form a neglected phase of American life . M.

    <head type="act">ACT FIRST</head>
    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>SCENE .— The hut of the CHISERA , in the foot-hills of the Sierras . It stands at the mouth of a steep , dark cañon , opening toward the valley of Sagharawite . At the back rise high and barren cliffs where eagles nest ; at the foot of the cliffs runs a stream , hidden by willow and buckthorn and toyon . The wickiup is built in the usual Paiute fashion , of long willows set about a circular pit , bent over to form a dome , thatched with reeds and grass . About the hut lie baskets and blankets , a stone metate , other household articles , all of the best quality ; in front is a clear space overflowing with knee-deep many-colored bloom of the California spring . A little bank that runs from the wickiup to the toyon bushes is covered with white forget-me-nots . The hearth-fire between two stones is quite out , but the deerskin that screens the opening of the hut is caught up at one side , a sign that the owner is not far from home , or expects to return soon .</stage>
     <stage>At first glance the scene appears devoid of life , but suddenly the call of a jay bird is heard faintly and far up the trail that leads to the right among the rocks . It is repeated nearer at hand , perfectly imitated but with a nuance that advises of human origin , and two or three half-naked Indians are seen to be making their way toward the bottom of the cañon , their movements so cunningly harmonized with the lines of the landscape as to render them nearly invisible . CHOCO and PAMAQUASH with two others come together at the end of the bank farthest from the CHISERA 'S hut .</stage>
    </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHOCO</speaker>
     <p>Who called ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PAMAQUASH</speaker>
     <p>It came from farther up .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHOCO</speaker>
     <p>Yavi , I think .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PAMAQUASH</speaker>
     <p>He must have seen something .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHOCO</speaker>
     <p>By the Bear , if the Castacs have crossed our boundaries , there are some of them shall not recross it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PAMAQUASH</speaker>
     <p>Hush — the Chisera — she will hear you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHOCO</speaker>
     <p>She is not in the hut . She went out toward the hills early this morning , and has not yet returned . Besides , if the Castacs have crossed , we cannot keep it from the women much longer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PAMAQUASH</speaker>
     <p><stage>Who has moved up to a better post of observation .</stage>There is some one on the trail .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The jay 's call is heard and answered softly by PAMAQUASH .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHOCO</speaker>
     <p>Yavi . But Tavwots is not with him .<stage>YAVI comes dropping from the cliffs .</stage>What have you seen ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>YAVI</speaker>
     <p>Smoke rising — by Deer Leap . Two long puffs and a short one .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The news is received with sharp , excited murmurs .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PAMAQUASH</speaker>
     <p>More than a score — and with all our youths we cannot count so many .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHOCO</speaker>
     <p>And this business of war leader still unsettled — The Council must sit at once . Go , one of you , and tell Chief Rain Wind that Tavwots has signaled from Deer Leap that more than a score of Castacs are out against us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PAMAQUASH</speaker>
     <p>And tell the women to prepare a gift hastily for the Chisera . Who knows how soon we shall have need of her medicine .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>One of the Indians departs on this errand .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHOCO</speaker>
     <p>Never so much need of it as when we have neglected our own part of the affair ! Even before the Castacs began to fill up our springs and drive our deer , we knew that the Chief is too old for war ; and now that the enemy has crossed our borders we are still leaderless .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PAMAQUASH</speaker>
     <p>So we should not be if we had followed the tribal use and given the leadership to years and experience . It is you young men who have unsettled judgment , with the to-do you have made about the Arrow-Maker .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHOCO</speaker>
     <p>I have nothing against years and experience , but when one has the gods as plainly on his side as Simwa —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>YAVI</speaker>
     <p>Never have I seen a man so increase in power and fortune —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PAMAQUASH</speaker>
     <p>Huh — huh ! I too have watched the growth of this Simwa . Also I have seen a gourd swelling with the rains , and I have not laid it to the gods in either case . But the Council must sit upon it . We must bring it to the Council .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>YAVI</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hotly .</stage>Why should you credit the gods with Simwa 's good fortune since he himself does not so claim it ? For my part , I think with the Arrow-Maker , that it is better for a man to thrive by his own wits , rather than by the making of medicine or the wisdom of the elders .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PAMAQUASH</speaker>
     <p><stage>From above .</stage>Tst — st , Tavwots !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>TAVWOTS comes down the cañon panting with speed . He drops exhausted on the bank , and YAVI gives him water between his palms from the creek .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHOCO</speaker>
     <p>Have they crossed ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAVWOTS</speaker>
     <p>Between Deer Leap and Standing Rock — more than a score , though I think some of them were boys — but they had no women .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHOCO</speaker>
     <p>They mean fighting , then !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>YAVI</speaker>
     <p>Well , they can have it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAVWOTS</speaker>
     <p>But they should not be let fatten on our deer before they come to it . Winnemucca , whom I left at Deer Leap , will bring us word where they camp to-night . In the mean time there is much to do .<stage>Rising .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHOCO</speaker>
     <p>Much . No doubt Simwa will have something to suggest .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAVWOTS</speaker>
     <p>The Arrow-Maker is not yet war leader , my friend . I go to the Chief and the Council .<stage>He goes .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHOCO</speaker>
     <p>And yet , I think the Chief favors Simwa , else why should he prefer to put the election to lot rather than keep to the custom of the fathers ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>YAVI</speaker>
     <p><stage>Going .</stage>There might be reasons to that , not touching the merits of the Arrow-Maker .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PAMAQUASH</speaker>
     <p>Tavwots has met the women !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Sounds of the grief of the women in the direction of the camp .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHOCO</speaker>
     <p>They are coming to the Chisera . We should not have let them find us here ; they will neglect their business with her to beset us with questions .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>To them enter three women of the campody of Sagharawite , carrying perfect-patterned , bowl-shaped baskets , with gifts of food for the CHISERA . SEEGOOCHE , the Chiefs wife , is old and full of dignity . TIAWA is old and sharp , but WACOBA is a comfortable , comely matron , who wears a blanket modestly yet to conceal charms not past their prime . SEEGOOCHE and TIAWA wear basket caps , but WACOBA has a bandeau of bright beads about her hair . They show signs of agitation , instantly subdued at sight of the men .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p>Is this true what Tavwots has told us , that the Castacs are upon us ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHOCO</speaker>
     <p>No nearer than Pahrump . Not so near by the time we have done with them . What gifts have you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TIAWA</speaker>
     <p>The best the camp affords . Think you we would stint when the smoke of the Castacs goes up within our borders ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WACOBA</speaker>
     <p>Where is she ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHOCO</speaker>
     <p>Abroad in the hills gathering roots and herbs for to-night 's medicine . Wait for her .— We must go look to our fighting gear .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out in the direction of the campody .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PAMAQUASH</speaker>
     <p><stage>To WACOBA .</stage>My bow case , is it finished ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WACOBA</speaker>
     <p>And the bow inside it . See that you come not back to me nor to your young son until the bowstring is frayed asunder .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PAMAQUASH</speaker>
     <p>If you do your work with the Chisera as well as we with Castac , you shall not need to question our bowstrings .<stage>Going .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p>Leave us to deal — though if she cannot help us in this matter , I do not know where we shall turn .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TIAWA</speaker>
     <p>Never have I asked help of her , and been disappointed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WACOBA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gathering flowers .</stage>Aye , but that was mere women 's matters , weevil in the pine nuts , a love-charm or a colicky child . This is war !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Still peering about .</stage>As if that were not a woman 's affair also !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TIAWA</speaker>
     <p>You may well say that ! It was in our last quarrel with Castac I lost the only man-child I ever had , dead before he was born . When the women showed me his face , it was all puckered with the bitterness of that defeat . You may well say a woman 's matter !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p>That was the year my husband was first made Chief , and we covered defeat with victory , as we shall again . It was Tinnemaha , the father of the Chisera , went before the gods for us , I remember .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TIAWA</speaker>
     <p>Well for us that he taught her his strong medicine . Not a fighting man from Tecuya to Tehachappi but trusts in her .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Goes to the creek and dips up water to drink in her basket cap .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WACOBA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Tentatively .</stage>It is believed by some that she makes medicine for Simwa , the Arrow-Maker , and that is why his arrows are so well feathered and fly so swiftly to the mark .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p>Simwa ! Why , he scoffs at charms and speaks lightly even of the gods .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TIAWA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Giving the others to drink from her cap .</stage>Aye ; Simwa puts not faith in anybody but Simwa .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p>And with good reason , for he is the most skillful of the tribesmen . He has made all the arrows for the fighting men . Do you think they will make him war leader ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WACOBA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Ornamenting the basket she has brought with a wreath of flowers , which she plucks .</stage>Padahoon will never agree to it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TIAWA</speaker>
     <p>But if Simwa is the better man ?</p>

     <p>Prutt ! If age and experience were all , my husband would not ask that a new leader be chosen . Young men are keenest-eyed and quickest afoot .</p>

      <stage>Going over to WACOBA , aside from SEEGOOCHE .</stage>

     <p>Ugh , huh ! So the scent lies up that trail ? Well , why not ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WACOBA</speaker>
     <p>Why not ? The Chief 's daughter and the war leader ? A good match .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TIAWA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Going across to the hut .</stage>Aye , a good match !... Do you know , I have never been in the Chisera 's house . It is said she has a great store of baskets and many beads . Let us look .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p>No , no ; do not go near it .</p>

     <p><stage>Alarmed .</stage>Kima ! Tiawa , she may be watching you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TIAWA</speaker>
     <p><stage>By the hut , but not daring to enter it .</stage>What harm to visit a neighbor 's house when the door is open . Besides , she makes no bad medicine .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p>We know that she does not , but not that she could not if she would .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TIAWA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Returning reluctantly .</stage>Why should we hold the Chisera so apart from the campody ? Why should she not have a husband and children as other women ? How can she go before the gods for us until she knows what we are thinking in our hearts ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WACOBA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Jumping up .</stage>I have seen something stirring in the alder bushes . I think the Chisera comes !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p>Do not be seen too near the hut . Come away , Tiawa .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TIAWA</speaker>
     <p>Have you the presents ready ?<stage>The women take up their baskets hastily .</stage>Hide your basket , Seegooche . It is not well to let all your gifts appear on the first showing , for if she is not persuaded at first , we shall have something of more worth .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The CHISERA comes out of the trail by the almond bushes , young and tall and comely , but of dignified , almost forbidding , carriage . She is dressed chiefly in skins ; her hair is very long , braided with beads . She carries a small burden basket on her back , supported by a band about her forehead . She removes this , and drops it at the hut , coming forward .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Friends , what have we to do with one another ? Seegooche , has your meal fermented ? Or has your baby the colic again , Wacoba ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p>We have a gift for you , Chisera .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The women draw near timidly , each , as she speaks , placing her basket at the CHISERA 'S feet , and retire .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking at the gifts , without touching them .</stage>The venison is fat and tender ; Seegooche , there is no one grinds meal so smoothly as you . The honey is indeed acceptable .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>After a pause , during which the medicine woman looks keenly at them .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TIAWA</speaker>
     <p>We do not come for ourselves , Chisera , but from the tribeswomen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p>From every one who has a husband or son able to join battle .</p>

     <p>When the noise of battle is joined and the buzzards come , may they feed on our foes , Chisera —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p>O friend of the gods , befriend us !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The women cast dust on their hair and rock to and fro while the CHISERA speaks , lifting up their arms in an agony of entreating .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Am I not also a tribeswoman ? Would not I do so much for my people ? But your gifts and your prayers will be acceptable to the gods , for of myself I can do nothing .<stage>She stoops to the gifts , but hesitates .</stage>Who is this that comes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The young girls steal up noiselessly through the bushes , led by the Chief 's daughter . BRIGHT WATER is lovely and young ; her hair , flowing loosely over her shoulders and breast , is mingled with strings of beads and bright berries . Her dress of fringed buckskin is heavily beaded , her arms are weighted with armlets of silver and carved beads of turquoise ; about her neck hangs a disk of glittering shell . She walks proudly , a little in advance of the others , who bunch up timidly like quail on the trail , behind her . The women , catching sight of the girls , spring up , frightened , and stand half protectingly between them and the CHISERA .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TIAWA</speaker>
     <p>It is the Chief 's daughter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p>What do you here ? You have neither sons nor husbands that you should ask spells and charms .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BRIGHT WATER</speaker>
     <p>How , then , shall we have husbands or sons , if the battle goes against us ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Well answered , Chief 's daughter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BRIGHT WATER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Surprised .</stage>You know me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I have heard that the loveliest maiden of Sagharawite is called</l>
      <l>Bright Water , daughter of Rain Wind , Chief of the Paiutes .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Going over to BRIGHT WATER .</stage>You should have stayed in the wickiup , my daughter ; you are too young to go seeking magic medicine .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BRIGHT WATER</speaker>
     <p>The more need because we are young , mother . If the loss of battle come to you , at least you have had the love of a man and the lips of children at the breast . But we , if the battle goes against us , what have we ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Ay , truly , Seegooche , there are no joys so hard to do without as those we have not had .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BRIGHT WATER</speaker>
     <p>Therefore , we ask a charm , Chisera , for our sweethearts ; and , in the mean time , may this remind you —</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She drops a bracelet in the CHISERA 'S basket .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WHITE FLOWER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Going forward .</stage>The scarlet beads from me , Chisera . I am to be married in the time of tasseling corn .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TUIYO</speaker>
     <p>The shells from me , Chisera . Good medicine !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIOKE</speaker>
     <p>Strong Bow is my lover , Chisera . Bring him safe home again .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The girls retire after dropping their gifts in the CHISERA 'S basket .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p><stage>A little stiffly .</stage>You have no need of gifts . Am I not young , even as you ? Should you pray for your lover any more or less for the sake of a few beads ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Anxiously .</stage>Be not angry , Chisera . They would repay you for the dancing and the singing .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The CHISERA gathers up the gifts that the older women have brought and goes into the hut . The girls take up their gifts , puzzled .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p>I am afraid you have vexed her with your foolish quest .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BRIGHT WATER</speaker>
     <p>Has the Chisera a lover also , that she speak so ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p>It is not possible and we not know of it , for since her father 's death if any sought her hand in marriage , he must come to my husband in the matter of dowry .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WACOBA</speaker>
     <p>No fear that any will come while she is still the Chisera .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BRIGHT WATER</speaker>
     <p>She is the wisest of us all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TIAWA</speaker>
     <p>Wisdom is good as a guest , but it wears out its welcome when it sits by the hearth-stone .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BRIGHT WATER</speaker>
     <p>She has great power with the gods .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WACOBA</speaker>
     <p>So much so that if she had a husband , he dare not beat her lest she run and tattle to them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p>She is our Chisera , and there is not another like her between Tehachappi and Tecuya . If she were wearied with stooping and sweating , if she were anxious with bearing and rearing , how could she go before the gods for us ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TIAWA</speaker>
     <p>Aye , that is the talk in the wickiups , that we must hold her apart from us to give her room for her great offices , but I have always said — but I am old and nobody minds me — I have always said that if she had loved as we love and had borne as we have borne , she would be the more fitted to entreat the gods that we may not lose .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>As the CHISERA comes out of the hut .</stage>If you are angry , Chisera , turn it against our enemies of Castac .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>You know that I cannot curse .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TIAWA</speaker>
     <p>Is it true , Chisera , that you make no bad medicine ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Many kinds of sickness I can cure , and give easy childbirth . I can bring rain , and give fortune in the hunt , but of the making of evil spells I know nothing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p>But your father , the medicine man — he was the dread and wonder of the tribes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Aye , my father could kill by a spell , and make a wasting sickness with a frown , but he thought such powers not proper to women : therefore he taught me none .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WACOBA</speaker>
     <p>But you will bring a blessing on the battle ? Oh , Chisera , they do not tell us women , but we hear it whispered about the camp that the men of Castac are five and twenty , and even with the youths who go to their first battle we cannot make a score of ours . It is the Friend of the Soul of Man must make good our numbers .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Even now I go to prepare strong medicine .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WACOBA</speaker>
     <p>Come away , then , and leave the Chisera to her work .<stage>Going .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p>May the gods befriend you . If we have your blessing , we care little for another 's curse .<stage>Going .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Stay . After all , we are but women together , and if a woman may give counsel , women may hear it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TIAWA</speaker>
     <p>Would we might hear yours to-day !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>When the smoke of the medicine fire arises , so as to be seen from the spring , do you come up along the creek as far as the black rock .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WOMEN</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>When you hear the medicine rattles , stand off by the toyon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WOMEN</speaker>
     <p>By the toyon — yes !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>But when the rattles are stopped , and the singing falls off , come up very softly , not to disturb the Council , and hear what the gods have said . If the men speak against it , I will stand for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p>Our thanks to you , Chisera , for this kindness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TIAWA</speaker>
     <p>And though you are a Chisera , and have strange intercourse with the gods , I know you a woman , by this token .</p>

     <p>Doubt it not , but go .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking up the trail .</stage>Ah , Simwa , Simwa , what bond there is between us , when , if I but pronounce thy name in my heart , thy voice answers .<stage>The love call is repeated far up the cliffs above her hut , and she answers it , singing :</stage>Over-long are thy feet on the trails , O Much Desired !! Dost thou not hear afar what my blood whispers , Betraying my heart as the whir Of the night-moth 's wings betray the lilies ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>As she sings , SIMWA , in full war dress , comes dropping down , hand over hand , from the rocks , until he stands beside her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>Did you not hear me when first I called ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>I heard you , Most Desired . When do I not ? Even when I sleep , my heart wakes to hear you . The women have been with me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>You know , then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>That this very night a war party of ours must go out to meet the</l>
      <l>Castacs .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>And before that there will be a Council to choose a war leader ? Has the Chief told you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Not since this latest word , but yesterday he bid me prepare a strong medicine , for he thought the election would be made by lot . But I did not tell him , O Much Desired , that I had already made medicine a night and a day to let the choice fall on you . A day and a night by Deer Leap on Toorape , where never foot but mine had been , I made medicine , and the answer is sure .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>That I shall get the leadership ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>When have the gods denied me anything that I asked for your sake ,</l>
      <l>Arrow-Maker of Sagharawite ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>The Padahoon hunts on a cold trail , and there is nothing for me to do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He sits on the bank and the CHISERA sits below him .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Beloved , there is much to do , for before the shadow which lies between my feet has grown tall again , I must make medicine for the sake of this war ; and I have spent so much on you , the power goes from me . Now , you must put your hand upon my heart , and nurse it warm , so that the people lack nothing of their Chisera .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>Is that good , Chisera ?<stage>Puts his arm about her .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Very good , Friend of my heart .<stage>She leans upon his arm .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quickened by the caress .</stage>Chisera , what did you do before I came ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Oh , then I lived in the dream of you . When I ran in the trails , my heart expected you at every turn , and in the dark of the hut the sense of you brooded on my sleep . But I thought it was all for the gods .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Fatuously .</stage>Until I came .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Did I tell you , Simwa , that day when first you found me dancing in the sun — you had been gathering eagle 's feathers for your arrows , do you remember ?— I thought that day that you were of the gods yourself , for I was sick with longing , and the spring was in my blood .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>And when I came again , what did you think ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>That you were the man most deserving their favor , and that all the medicine I had learned until then was merely that I might persuade them for your sake .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sitting up .</stage>Chisera , when you go up to the Friend of the Soul of Man , you cannot be always asking for the tribespeople . Do you not sometimes ask for yourself ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>What should I ask for when I have your love ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>For friends , perhaps , who are to be rewarded , or those who have done you injuries ?<stage>Watching her .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laughing .</stage>Once , Simwa , before I was sure of you , I made a singing medicine to draw you from the camp . And you came , Arrow-Maker of Sagharawite , you came .<stage>Laying her hands on his bosom .</stage>Did you not feel me draw you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>Often and often , as it were a tie-rope in my bosom between us .<stage>Letting go her hands and stretching himself preparatory to rising .</stage>But I did not think it was your medicine .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>What then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rising and walking about .</stage>Your beauty and the wonder of your dancing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Tell me , Simwa , in the beginning I know you did not believe ; but now you understand the power I have from the Friend of the Soul of Man ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>Surely ; now that I am about to be made war leader by means of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Rising and going back to the feathering of the prayer-stick .</stage>
      <l>But</l>
      <l>I have heard the women gossiping at the spring —</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>What did they say ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>That Simwa does not believe in charms and scoffs at the gods .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>That was true<stage>recovering</stage>— once . But now that I am become the most notable arrow-maker in Sagharawite —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Now — now you do not scoff at the Chisera ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Embarrassed .</stage>But it is not always well for a man to say what he thinks . If I were to tell in the campody whence my good fortune is , would not Padahoon do me some mischief for it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>But , Simwa , am I never to come to you as other women to the wickiups of their husbands ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>What need , Chisera , when I come so often to yours ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>The need of women to serve openly where they love .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>But what service could you do me when you had lost the respect of the tribesmen ? You know the tribal custom . It is not for the friend of the gods to dig roots and dress venison .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Throws himself on the bank beside her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>I have not found the gods any the less friendly since I have loved , Arrow-Maker ; and I know not why it should seem strange to others that I should know love as — as we have known it . Only to-day the girls of the village came to me to buy a charm to keep their lovers safe in war . There was not one but dared to ask , even though she would not speak her lover 's name for bashfulness . See , one of them gave me this to make medicine upon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taking it .</stage>Bright Water gave you this ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Surprised .</stage>How did you know ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>I thought you said — that is , I have seen her wear it . Did she tell you from whom she had it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Not by his name , but by the way he looked to her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>How was that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>As every lover looks to every maid — tall and strong and straight of back . Even as you look to me , Beloved .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Relieved , giving back the amulet .</stage>May your medicine preserve him . And , as for me , Chisera , I wish I could persuade the tribesmen to look as favorably on me as you do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>But you have no enemies .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>The Sparrow Hawk , without doubt . Could you give me a curse for him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rising .</stage>Ah , you should not have asked me that . Never since my father died have I thought to regret that he did not teach me the making of evil medicine . Would I had all the curses in the world !<stage>Turning piteously to him .</stage>But you do not love me any the less because I have not one little , little curse to give you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>No , it is nothing . No curse can reach me past your blessing . But I would not have thought the old man would leave you wholly unprotected . Why , even I could wrong you , and , without a curse<stage>trying to speak lightly</stage>you could not punish me for it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>If no one does me no more wrong than you , Simwa , I need no cursing . But , in truth , my father did give me — Ah , now I have thought of another gift for you , Arrow-Maker of Sagharawite ! Before he died , the medicine man , my father — did I not tell you ?<stage>she rummages eagerly in her medicine bag</stage>— gave me this magic arrow against my evil hour .<stage>Drawing it out .</stage>See how heavy it is , and how the blood drain is cut in a medicine writing round and round the shaft .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>What magic has it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>That however far and feebly it is shot , it flies straight to the mark , over hills and high mountains , in the dark or light , and death rides upon its shaft .<stage>Laughing .</stage>Why , you could kill even me with this arrow . See , I have tied it in your quiver , so that you may not mistake it and shoot it away on any slight occasion . It is my latest gift to you , Beloved .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>Thanks for the gift , Chisera . Now give me the quiver . I must join the others before the Council . The fighting men were painting their faces when I came .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>A war-whoop is heard at a distance .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>I hear shouting .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>I must go quickly . I would not have Padahoon find me here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Yes , he would brood upon it like a sage hen , until he had hatched mischief . Oh , Simwa , though I have prayed the gods until they and I are weary , to keep you safe in this war , yet my heart shakes to see you go . There is a beating in my breast as of the wings of vultures after battle .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>You have wearied yourself too much making medicine . If you have no more faith in the gods , have a little in me . If I can go out of Sagharawite as war leader , I shall come back with the spoil of Castac .<stage>Shouts are heard nearer than before .</stage>Now I go quickly !<stage>He turns carelessly from her lingering caress and crosses to the toyon , starting back at the sight of PADAHOON , moving noiselessly through the chaparral , blanketed and watchful .</stage>What ! Has the Sparrow Hawk eaten when-o-nabe that he must visit the Chisera on the eve of Council ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>I come from the Chief — but I had not expected to find Simwa , the scoffer , before me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Uneasily .</stage>I have been gathering eagles ’ feathers for my arrows under Toorape .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>Quite so — and are not the first hunter to find the shortest way past the house of the Medicine Woman . But it is well known that Simwa seeks no charms for himself . The Chief has been asking for you .<stage>He passes on to the CHISERA , standing stiffly with strained attention by her hut . SIMWA hesitates , recovers himself , and passes out with the appearance of indifference .</stage>Chisera , Rain Wind , Chief of Sagharawite , greets you , and bids me say that at the moth-hour he will be here with the fighting men to invite the favor of the gods in this war with Castac .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>And before that —?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>There will be a Council —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>To choose a war leader .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>So the Chief has said .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>And it is the purpose of the Council to put this election to the gods ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>It may come to that —<stage>A pause .</stage>Chief Rain Wind is a dotard . What should a woman know of these matters ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>All that the gods are thinking in their hearts .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>The gods , aye ! But what word have the gods of the affairs of</l>
      <l>Sagharawite except as you carry it ? Now between us — Chisera —</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>What is there between us , Padahoon , that our talk should be otherwise than appears at the Council ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>There should be a matter of two doeskins , tanned white and fine<stage>he produces them from under his blanket</stage>if the gods are friendly . Look , Chisera !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He spreads them out before the CHISERA , who is seated by the hut , feathering a prayer-stick .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Dropping the doeskins negligently .</stage>Oh , the man can make an arrow .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>But not lead a war party ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>A war leader , Chisera , should be neither old and timid , nor young and overbold , but of middle years and discretion ; not so hot in his heart that his head cannot reason with it , nor so reasonable that it cools his heart .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>As he stands again , his hands are folded inside his arms ; he is not so sure of his errand .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Like ... Padahoon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Wheedling .</stage>What will the gods think of a blanket of the Navajoes<stage>he spreads it out before her</stage>— thick and fine — and four strings of shells — and a cake of mesquite meal —?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Are the gods a-cold , Padahoon , that you bring them a blanket ? Is there hunger in their camp , think you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>Let the things stay in yours , Chisera ; they will remind you to speak well of me when you go before the Friend of the Soul of Man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Put up your pack , Padahoon !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>It is a little matter , Chisera ; a handful of sticks thrown on the ground . What should the gods care for a handful of sticks ? And the blanket is very thick . Shall I leave it a little while , that you may admire it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Put up your pack , Padahoon , and learn not to think so lightly of the gods , lest they visit it upon you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Reluctantly putting up the bribe ; after a pause , revolving new measures .</stage>Chisera , this is a man 's business which comes before you in the Council . Will you hear man-talk from me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Is it possible the Sparrow Hawk does so much credit to my understanding ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>Chisera , we have had peace now at Sagharawite so many summers that scarcely a man of us besides myself has seen battle ; also we are a little outnumbered . Have you thought , Chisera , what will come to Sagharawite if we go out under an untried leader ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>What will come will be as the gods determine . What reason have you to think they will favor you more than Simwa ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>It is my experience , Chisera , that the gods are inclined to the better man . And , look you , Chisera , this is perhaps my last chance to serve my people . Comes another war , if there are enough of us left after this to make another war possible , I shall be too old for leadership . And I have that in me which I would prove before I die . This is man-talk , Chisera . Do you understand it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>I understand that you want greatly this election , but I can do nothing except as the gods declare . Put up your pack , Padahoon , I have work to do .<stage>Rising .</stage></p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>Simwa put trust in the gods ! Simwa believe that by singing and dancing and waving of arms , with a rag of buckskin and a hair of your head and three leaves of a seldom-flowering plant , you can turn the fortunes of war ? This will be news for the fighting men , Chisera .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quivering , but controlling herself .</stage>Padahoon , now by this I am minded to prove what the gods can do against tale-bearers and snakes in the grass !<stage>Balancing her medicine stick for a moment , she seems on the point of invoking the gods against him , but thinks better of it .</stage>Nay , but the gods have greater affairs .<stage>Sound of the drums in the direction of the camp .</stage>Now I go to prepare strong medicine so that you shall know , Padahoon , how the gods choose between you and the Arrow-Maker .</p>

     <speaker>PAMAQUASH</speaker>
     <p>He stays only until the fighting men are gathered together .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>

    <stage>As the preparations have gone forward , the sound of the drums and rattles , with an occasional subdued whoop , has drawn nearer , and the Fighting Men , led by the CHIEF , in full fighting gear , arrive in single file marching to the drums .

     <p>Let the Council sit .<stage>Eleven of the elders seat themselves in a circle about the fire , turning toward the CHIEF . The others stand or sit attentively in the background .

RAIN WIND blows a puff of smoke to all the gods , returning to his place in the Council ; the pipe passes from hand to hand ; when it has passed all about , each tribesman blowing smoke and saluting , the CHIEF rises and stands before the CHISERA 'S hut .</stage>Chisera , Chisera , come to Council !</p>

     <p><stage>Rising .</stage>Tribesmen , for as many years as a fir tree needs to bear cones , I have been Chief in Sagharawite . Now I am old , and , like a badger , see only my own trail<stage>grunts of dissent</stage>, and my legs carry me no farther than my eyes see . Therefore , since there is war with Castac concerning the piñon trees which are ours<stage>grunts and exclamations</stage>, it is right you have a younger man to lead you . But , since it has never happened that there must be a war leader chosen while there is a chief alive and sitting in Council , I think it well to inquire how the gods stand toward us .

     <p><stage>Continuing , with earnestness .</stage>Tribesmen , I am not myself of two minds in this business . I speak freely for Padahoon according to our custom which is , without discredit to the Arrow-Maker , for the leadership of the elder . But at least let us remember that the gods have high affairs ; they are not always listening to the gossip of the camp-fire and hut . What word have they of Sagharawite except as the Chisera carries it ? If we put the choice to them , let her know what we are thinking in our hearts . Let Simwa and Sparrow Hawk declare it so that we and the gods shall know how they stand toward the conduct of this war . I have said .<stage>Seats himself amid general approval .</stage></p>

     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rising .</stage>Chief and tribesmen , you know me . What I think in my heart , I say ; and what I say I do . The piñon trees are ours , since the time of our father 's fathers<stage>general assent</stage>, and this is a vain fight for the men of Castac . Inasmuch as they have crossed our borders , they do evilly , but they are also Paiutes , as we are , and sons of the Bear . Aforetime when the Tecuyas came against us , they were as our brothers . Now , were I war leader , I should leave them at Pahrump and , going up behind the ridge of Toorape , strike at their villages . When we have their women and children and their stores , we can make terms with our brothers of Castac . So shall we save our honor and our allies .</p>

    <stage>The CHISERA produces the sticks from her medicine bag , and hands them to one of the Old Men . To each of the others who will dance with her ( two or three ) she gives a fetish from her bag . They have already put on appropriate headdresses and are prepared for dancing . She motions the rattles to begin . Behind her are the Old Men , with the drums and rattles ; on each side , the Fighting Men seated on the ground . The dance begins , the CHISERA singing . The Old Men keep up a crooning accompaniment ; from time to time the Fighting Men join the singing and exhibit a growing excitement as the dance progresses . At intervals , one and another of them , leaps to his feet and joins the dance . At the last , the CHISERA , whirling rapidly , falls to the ground . Instantly the rattles are stopped , and the people wait in suspense the word of the gods . The women are seen to steal up through the toyon bushes . The CHISERA lifts herself slowly on one elbow , as if waking from a drugged sleep . She stretches out her hand for the sacred sticks . She drops them with a quick turn of the wrist , gathers them up and drops them again , seeking for an augury . She throws up the arm with the medicine stick and begins to chant .</stage>

     <speaker>ACT SECOND</speaker>
     <p>SCENE .— The campody of Sagharawite , three months later , near the new wickiup of the Arrow-Maker . At the right , the house of RAIN WIND , and behind all a spring under a clump of dwarf oaks . A little trail runs between stones to connect the Arrow-Maker with the rest of the campody , and beyond it the valley rises gently to the Sierra foothills , brooding under the spring haze . A little to the fore of SIMWA 'S house lies a great heap of blankets , baskets , and camp utensils , displayed to the best advantage , the wedding dower of the Chief 's daughter . By her father 's house BRIGHT WATER is being dressed for bridal by her young companions . They braid her hair , paint her face , tie her moccasins , and arrange her beads over the robe of white doeskin ; they laugh as they work and are happily important as is the custom of bridesmaids . The older women are winnowing grain and grinding at the metate . At the left and front , SIMWA , TAVWOTS , and others are gambling with dice made of halves of black-walnut hulls , filled with pitch ; the number indicated by bits of shell embedded in the pitch . They are shaken in a small basket and turned out on a basket plaque . The older men look on , smoking . TAVWOTS is broad-faced and merry , and does not neglect to ogle the girls at intervals , which causes them to giggle and hide their heads in their blankets . The men have on their holiday dress , especially the younger companions of SIMWA .</p>

     <p>Tavwots , your wit misleads you . The Chisera is not a subject for jest or the favor of men ; she is an advocate with the gods for us .</p>

     <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
     <p>On what grounds ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAVWOTS</speaker>
     <p>None , I think , except that they are able . A bowman of Tehachappi inquired of me how many fell at Castac , and I , thinking to glorify the tribe ,— I told him .</p>

Not ten sleeps have passed since the last of our fighting men returned from the killing of our blood brothers , and already we have a witness to our folly ! The Tecuyas are three to one of us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PAMAQUASH</speaker>
     <p>But the luck of Simwa is more than three times that of Tecuya .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>The fortunes of Simwa ! What are they but the accidents of time and weather . A landslip on the trail , a rainstorm that wetted their bowstrings and left ours dry . The damp has slacked your wits , Rain Wind , that you are not able to distinguish between the Arrow-Maker and his luck .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>The witness of the gods in his favor .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>The gods are not always so attentive . Where was the luck of the Arrow-Maker that it has not saved us from this ?<stage>Shaking the arrow as he descends .</stage>Show me something which we owe to Simwa if you would have me trust in him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
     <p>I will show you the pit of your own heart , Padahoon , and the adder that bites at the root of it . You are jealous of the fame and the office of Simwa , but you shall not sink your venom in the minds of the Fighting Men .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>I would I could sting them to understand that if Tecuya comes against us , they will not trust so much to luck as to war craft .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
     <p>Understand yourself that whatever comes of this business of Tecuya , Simwa is still war leader . You are too old a man , Padahoon , to be told that whoever lessens the credit of the war leader saps at the strength of Sagharawite .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>Aye , I am an old man and in my dotage when I seek to set years of good faith and experience against the fortunate moments of a fool .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
     <p>The Chief has spoken . No more of this until the Council . In the mean time , not a word to the women . It is an ill omen for a feast .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out , followed by all but TAVWOTS , CHOCO , PAMAQUASH , and PADAHOON .</stage>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>You too , Tavwots — you have looked at the lure of the Arrow-Maker 's luck and do not see the snare which his want of wit spreads for your feet ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAVWOTS</speaker>
     <p><stage>Uncertainly .</stage>But if the fortune of Simwa is not his own , whence is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>Tell me , Tavwots , when another man seeks favor from the gods , by whom does it come ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAVWOTS</speaker>
     <p>By the Chisera . But what —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>On the morning of the election , when I went from the Chief to advise the Chisera , I met Simwa by her hut .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PAMAQUASH</speaker>
     <p>I also met him when I came back from Leaping Water to bring word to the women — he said he had been gathering eagles ’ feathers for his arrows .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>So he said to me . Feathers for arrows when every man had his quiver full at his back !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAVWOTS</speaker>
     <p>But Simwa puts no faith in magic medicine . Why , he has not even asked the Chisera to his wedding !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>No , not even though the Chief 's daughter urged it .<stage>A pause full of significance .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAVWOTS</speaker>
     <p>No , no ! Padahoon ! Unless the Chisera owned to it herself , I would not believe it . The Chief is right . The wound of your jealousy festers and corrupts your tongue .<stage>Turning his back on PADAHOON he claps PAMAQUASH on the shoulder .</stage>Come and dance !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHOCO</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gathering his blanket around him .</stage>Even if the Chisera owned it , I would not believe it .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The men move in the direction of the merrymaking and are met by the younger people , laughing and shouting for SIMWA . PADAHOON watches them bitterly for a while , and , revolving many things , draws his blanket up and departs in the direction of the CHISERA 'S hut .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PAMAQUASH</speaker>
     <p>Come , Arrow-Maker , a speech for your bridal .<stage>Laughter and approval .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Drunk with popularity .</stage>The war leader loves deeds rather than talking .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAVWOTS</speaker>
     <p>We have seen what your fighting is like . Give us a speech .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>Friends and tribesmen , the fortune of Simwa is Simwa . Does the Bear take weapons against the woodchuck , and shall the sons of the Bear make charms against their enemies ? The spoil of Castac is in our camp<stage>cheers</stage>and our young men hunt within their borders .<stage>Applause .</stage>If any of the tribes inquire where are the fullest harvests , the fattest deer , the prettiest maidens<stage>he flings his blanket about BRIGHT WATER</stage>, bid him look for the land of Simwa the Arrow-Maker .<stage>Shouts and laughter .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>YOUNG MEN</speaker>
     <p>Come , now , a dance , a dance ! Tavwots , dance for us !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The cries increasing , TAVWOTS is pushed forward to dance , others cry for PAMAQUASH and YAVI , who join TAVWOTS , laughing , to dance the blanket dance , all the others singing and keeping time with swaying bodies . The girls hover about the dancers , and as at certain points in the dance the Young Men attempt to cast their blankets about the heads of the girls , they duck and squeal . Finally , amid much laughter , each dancer captures a girl , rubbing his cheek against hers , the Indian equivalent of a kiss . With great merriment the crowd moves off in the direction of the mesa , disclosing PADAHOON and the CHISERA , who have come up unobserved .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>Come this way , Chisera . The girls are out on the mesa , dancing with the bride , and the women are grinding at the metate for the marriage feast .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>But where is Simwa ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>With the bride , no doubt . Here is his wickiup , and here the marriage dower beside it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>All this ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>Never so many gifts went to a wedding in Sagharawite . Every woman whose man came back safe from the war gave a basket or a blanket , and Simwa gave all of his share of the spoil of Castac .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>And that , I doubt not , is bitter for you to see , Padahoon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>Why , as to that , Chisera , it is good to see spoil of our foes in the camp ; but the fighting men of Castac were our blood brothers . See , here is the blanket where the newly married pair shall sit to receive the blessings of the fruitful women .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Bitterly .</stage>But not the blessing of the Chisera . Never before , in my time , has there been a bride of Sagharawite but sent to ask my blessing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>Aye , but Simwa does not believe in charms and spells .<stage>The CHISERA seems about to break out angrily , but restrains herself . PADAHOON watches her narrowly as he speaks .</stage>Look , Chisera ! Is not the bride fair ? Fit to set a man beside himself with desiring ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>She is but a child . Her breasts are scarcely grown . No fit mate for a war leader .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Watching her .</stage>But a man so well furnished with wisdom need not look for it in a wife . Is it not so , Chisera ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Padahoon , why do you tell me this ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p><stage>With the appearance of candor .</stage>As often as I came to your house to get medicine , you asked me for news of the campody , and seemed best pleased with news of Simwa , the war leader ; and with reason , since he has become the most notable man of the Paiutes . Yet , when I told you he was to be married to-day to the Chief 's daughter , you were slow to believe . Now tell me if I have lied , Chisera .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>You have not lied , Padahoon , but Simwa , he has lied . How long have you known this ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>Since the time of Taboose .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>And why not told me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>How could I think the Chisera wished to know ? It was a thing you might have heard from the women grinding meal or weaving baskets . But the Chisera does not often come to the village , except there is illness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>I have no time to gossip with the women . I have to go before the gods for them and their children .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>And now that you are told , what will you do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Is there so much to do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>Only to give him your blessing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Bitterly .</stage>Did I not give him that at Castac ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Begins to search about among Simwa 's effects .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>What seek you , Chisera ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>The arrow ! the quiver ! Surely Simwa does not dance at his wedding wearing his quiver ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>No ; but when he is not wearing it , no man knows where he hides it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Searching .</stage>The quiver ! I must find the quiver !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>‘ Tis said he has a magic arrow in it of such power he would have it fall into no man 's hands .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Muttering .</stage>Aye , the arrow ; the black arrow .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>Chisera , why does this marriage disturb you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Padahoon , why should you think it disturbs me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>You have come .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Why should not one maid come to the marriage of another ? There is scarce two summers ’ difference between me and the Chief 's daughter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>Yes , but you come in your blanket . Such has not been your custom when you have come among us on errands of healing ; then you dressed sumptuously , as befitted one bearing the word of the gods . Now you come like an angry woman who would hide what is in her heart .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p><stage>With dignity .</stage>Cover your own heart , Padahoon , lest I ask what mischief breeds in it to bid you observe me so much . I have not forgot that you would have paid me a blanket to be made war leader in the room of Simwa .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p><stage>With ugly insinuation .</stage>Ugh ! huh ! Perhaps I had been as fortunate as the Arrow-Maker , if , instead of giving it , I had offered to share it with you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Kima ! Padahoon , you do tempt me to try if I can curse .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Conciliatory .</stage>I have no wish to anger the friend of the gods , but I am a plain man wishing good to my campody , and it seems not good to me that Simwa has grown suddenly so great .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Recovering herself .</stage>What has that to do with the Chisera ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>I have known this Simwa since he was first tied in a basket , and , though he has grown to be war leader , I think he is most like a pod of rattleweed that is swollen to twice its size at the end of the season , yet has no more in it than at the beginning . And I do not know how , without the help of magic medicine , he has come to be what he is with so little in him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>The Chief 's daughter has trusted him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>She loves him .<stage>During this scene bursts of Indian music and singing have been heard at intervals . It grows louder . PADAHOON and CHISERA look off .</stage>They come this way , Chisera . You are right . When a man has married so fair a wife , there is not much left to be done for him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p><stage>With bitter irony , as she moves over against SIMWA 'S hut and puts up her blanket .</stage>I am not so sure .</p>

    <stage>BRIGHT WATER enters with the young girls , laughing and talking . Her hair is braided with golden poppies and falls over her shoulders .

     <speaker>BRIGHT WATER</speaker>
     <p>But now that she is here , Simwa , you will ask her to bless us ?</p>

     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Recovering himself with an effort .</stage>Surely , surely . But the married women have not blessed us yet .<stage>Taking the bride 's hand and leading her to the blanket .

    </sp>
    <stage>The married women take up their baskets and begin the ceremony of sprinkling the bride with nuts and seeds in token of fruitfulness .</stage>

     <lg>
      <stage>Looking steadily at SIMWA .</stage>
      <l>Aye — where he loves —</l>
      <stage>Pleadingly .</stage>
      <l>Simwa ! Simwa !</l>

    <stage>She drops her blanket and turns away .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Lifting her basket to her shoulder again .</stage>Let us go on with the marriage .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p><stage>To the company .</stage>If the Chisera knows any reason why this marriage should not go on , should she not say it openly ? A word half spoken breeds suspicion faster than flies at killing time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
     <p>What talk is this of reasons ? Have I not the disposing of my daughter in marriage ? Reason enough , if I wish it so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>That which is most reasonable to men , the gods see otherwise .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>A murmur begins in the camp , but SIMWA takes it up instantly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>He is thinking of the war with Castac . Truly , you were not eye to eye with the gods on that occasion , Padahoon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>Were I so sure it was of the gods , I had not stood out so against it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
     <p>Was not Simwa approved of the gods through the mouth of the Chisera ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>So you think .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
     <p>Is there another Arrow-Maker so skilled between Tehachappi and Tecuya ? Are any shafts better fashioned to fly straight to the mark ? Is there any hunter knows more surely where the herds feed , or strikes quicker the slot of a deer ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>As you think .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
     <p>Let be this talk of reasons . This is mere woman 's mischief , to nod and wink and to make signs with the eyebrows . A woman would have you think reason enough for marrying if she liked or misliked it . Chisera , this is no matter for the gods , but a plain mating of man and maid .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Flashing .</stage>Since when have you talked with the gods , that you think to lesson me in their business ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
     <p>Since you have been a father , to know reasons for the bestowal of daughters .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Grunts of appreciation .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Letting her blanket slip to her breast .</stage>Know , then , that if these are your reasons , Rain Wind , there is no more meat in them than in the husk of acorns . If good fortune hangs on all Simwa 's movements , it is by reason of the medicine I make that binds him in the favor of the Friend .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Leaning on his elbows , with the manner of being quite at ease .</stage>You are very free with your blessing , Chisera , if it is so ; for it is well known in the camp that Simwa , the Arrow-Maker , does not believe in charms , nor seek them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INDIANS</speaker>
     <p><stage>Grunting in assent .</stage>Ugh ! huh !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Letting fall her blanket in a burst of indignation .</stage>“ Nor seek them !”— Ah ! Simwa ! Simwa !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>A short pause of embarrassment and consternation ensues . Then PADAHOON , in a manner meant to seem impartial —</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>The medicine of the Chisera is very powerful , but one must allow a little credit to the gods . Simwa was chosen war leader by the trial of the seven sticks . As the gods willed , they made the sticks to fall . Is it not so , Chisera ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sullenly , from her blanket .</stage>I do not know . I did not look .<stage>Letting fall her blanket and speaking proudly .</stage>I had persuaded the Friend to give victory to the war leader . What should I care for the sticks ? A day and a night I made medicine , and the sign was sure . I said “ Simwa ” and the gods confirmed it .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The Indians remain silent , but draw a little away from SIMWA .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BRIGHT WATER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rising and turning toward her .</stage>Chisera , why should you make medicine for Simwa ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Chief 's daughter , do not ask .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BRIGHT WATER</speaker>
     <p>Chief 's daughter I am , and wife of the war leader . Why should you concern yourself with his affairs ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p><stage>After a pause , with great dignity .</stage>Because he loved me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INDIANS</speaker>
     <p>Ah ! Ah — ah ! Ah !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laughing .</stage>The Friend of the gods has eaten rattleweed . Does a man love a wild woman who goes muttering and waving her arms , when she should be weaving and grinding meal ? Would he take a wander-thought to his bed , and have witless children ? Sooner I had a snake in my hut to run and tattle to the gods of me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAVWOTS</speaker>
     <p><stage>To PADAHOON .</stage>Now , if it is true that he owes his fortune to the gods , they have deserted him , else he would not speak so to a jealous woman .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking long at the CHISERA , haggard and unpainted , her blanket trailing , and then to the Chief 's daughter , and back again , all the eyes of the campody following .</stage>Is there any comeliness in a witch , that a man should desire her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Alarmed .</stage>Simwa , Simwa ! If you have no care for yourself , at least remember my daughter !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rising .</stage>Have no care , mother . If I do not believe she can bless , neither do you believe that she can curse .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BRIGHT WATER</speaker>
     <p>Mother , let be . If this be true that she speaks , I am already cursed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Going to his wife .</stage>What have we to do with blessings or cursings ? The Chisera is unsound in her mind . I have seen her dancing in the hills sometimes where I went to gather eagle 's feathers for my arrows , and her madness has made a curious tale of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BRIGHT WATER</speaker>
     <p>I would I might believe it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p><stage>With returning complacency .</stage>Do you find it so hard to have a husband whom other women admire ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>Chief and tribesmen , if it be true that Simwa values charms so little , let him declare what it is he keeps sewed in his quiver so precious that he must hide it even on his wedding day .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Murmurs . The CHISERA , in alarm , endeavors to check PADAHOON . SIMWA turns upon him with a snarl .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>Kima !<stage>Wildly .</stage>You cannot prove that I had it of the Chisera !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Suddenly darting out two fingers from his mouth , moving them rapidly in the manner of a snake 's tongue , with a hissing sound .</stage>Snake of two tongues ! Now I know you for the man you are , braggart and liar !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>Coyote whelp !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>SIMWA grasps a war weapon , a stone tied in a crotched stick , from the heap of wedding gifts , and smites PADAHOON to the earth , standing threateningly over him . The others stiffen into tense attitudes , drawing their blankets tighter , their eyes burning bright . PADAHOON draws the knife that hangs in a sheath at his neck .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
     <p><stage>Putting SIMWA back with a hand at his breast .</stage>Peace ! Though you are made my son by this day 's work , you shall not usurp judgment .<stage>To PADAHOON , as SIMWA moves slowly back , his weapon lowered .</stage>What charge do you make ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rising on his elbow to spit blood .</stage>Thou art a liar , if ever there was one in Sagharawite , and have nothing which is not owed to the Chisera .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
     <p>Speak straight , Padahoon , or , by the Bear , I shall let him kill you where you lie .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>Three nights after the return from Tecuya , I saw you at the Chisera 's house — and again in the rains — and at the time of Taboose .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
     <p>Is it so , Chisera ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>It is so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>Did you go there for love or profit ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>SIMWA lets slip his weapon from his hand to the ground .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
     <p>Simwa , if you were the son of my body , I should not know which to believe .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>Believe him if you like .<stage>Sullenly .</stage>If a skunk walk in my trail and leave a stink there , shall I go out of my way to deny that it is mine ? No doubt the woman is both mad and shameless .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Murmurs of indignation .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Afraid , but furious .</stage>Then if you are shameless , begone ! Stay not to vex the marriage of a maiden . Go ! Have to do with your gods , and leave my daughter .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>BRIGHT WATER</speaker>
     <p>Mother ! Mother !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Shameless , am I , Seegooche ? Then there is one of your blood shall know a greater shame . Great hunter does she think her man ? Aye , but she shall come to dig roots for him when he fails of the hunt and be glad of the offal the other women give her for pity . For this I say to you , tribesmen of Sagharawite , that , though I cannot curse , yet I can take back my blessing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BRIGHT WATER</speaker>
     <p>All this is of no account , Chisera . No doubt you can contrive against the fame of Simwa and bespeak the gods to neglect him ; I wait to hear what proof you have that he loved you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p>Do not vex her , daughter , lest she turn the gods against you also .</p>

     <p>No matter , mother . What Simwa bears , I can bear . What proof , Chisera ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>What proof ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She turns toward SIMWA , faltering . He smiles contemptuously .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BRIGHT WATER</speaker>
     <p>That Simwa loved you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Slowly , her eyes on SIMWA .</stage>He came to my hut — in the night — Chief 's daughter<stage>boldly</stage>, even as he comes this night to yours .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BRIGHT WATER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Impatiently .</stage>But did he love you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>He made me so believe .<stage>Looking about and noting the lack of conviction .</stage>How else had he held me , since last the poppies bloomed , a lure to snare the favor of the gods ? Does he say he was not blessed ? Aye , twice blessed .<stage>She takes from her bosom the amulet .</stage>Was it not this you gave me to make medicine upon , to keep your lover safe in war ? Twice blessed he was ; but , as I made my blessing , so do I break it .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Drops the amulet and grinds it underfoot .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INDIANS</speaker>
     <p><stage>Moving uneasily .</stage>Ah ! Ah !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>And this is the proof that I speak truly . From this day , whoever brings me arrows shall have medicine upon them without price , and who would have news of the passing of the deer shall have it for the asking . Only Simwa shall have nothing but his own wit and the work of his hands , and by what befalls , you shall know the truth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BRIGHT WATER</speaker>
     <p>By this I know the truth ! You never loved him , or you would not now betray him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Moving toward the trail .</stage>And you , Bright Water , that think to lie in your husband 's arms this night , know that I have lain there before you . And you shall not dare to laugh as a bride laughs , lest it be to him my voice in the dusk ; and if he turns and sighs in his sleep , you shall wonder if he dreams of the Chisera . Long and anxiously you shall look in the trail when he is late from the hunt , and the men shall mock him that he could not keep the blessing he had got .<stage>BRIGHT WATER turns despairingly and sinks on the ground , holding her mother by the knees and sobbing bitterly . All the Indians draw away from SIMWA , leaving him standing , discomfited , in the middle of the camp . All look with awe and dread at the CHISERA . She produces a small medicine stick from under her blanket and twirls it with menace . Going .</stage>As for you , Arrow-Maker of Sagharawite , though I cannot curse , yet am I the friend of the gods , and they have regard to me . Look well to yourself , Simwa . Look well .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p>She cannot choose but do it . The men have kept her supplied with venison , but she must know that there is hunger in the camp of the women and children .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WACOBA</speaker>
     <p>And that the Tecuyas have taken the best of our fighting men .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TIAWA</speaker>
     <p>But no man of hers . I have always said — but because I am old nobody minds me — that if there was one of her household to go to battle , she would need no persuasion to go before the gods . I would Simwa had given her a child .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WACOBA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Aside from SEEGOOCHE .</stage>Then you believe that he was her lover ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TIAWA</speaker>
     <p>What else ? Would any but a jilted woman sit and mope while our wickiups go up in smoke ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WACOBA</speaker>
     <p>I would she had a child , but not Simwa 's . One of that breed is enough .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Who has moved nearer the hut .</stage>Hush , see the curtain !<stage>They start .</stage></p>

     <speaker>TIAWA</speaker>
     <p>It was the wind .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p>They say she has not made medicine since my daughter 's marriage .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WACOBA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking off to the right where the mountains dip abruptly valleyward .</stage>And to think that even now they must be fighting under Toorape .</p>

     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p>Hush ! Hush !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PADAHOON and the CHISERA come out of the hut . The CHISERA 'S whole appearance is of heartbreak and neglect . She leans against the boulders at the left , holding her blanket close , and answers PADAHOON sullenly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>And is this all your answer ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>The trail is cold between the gods and me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>Then you will not make medicine ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>And would not if I could .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Have you turned renegade , Chisera , and side with our enemies of</l>
      <l>Tecuya ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>No , Padahoon , but I see that no good comes of persuading the gods to do more for man than his natural destiny .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>You have always persuaded them to our advantage .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>What good came of having Simwa made war leader ? Had I not persuaded them to meddle with that business , the leadership would have fallen to you as the elder , and we should not now be without allies in our need .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>I am not sure the gods had so much to do with that : but if the mischief came through them , the gods must repair it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>I will not make medicine . Send the women away .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>What shall I say to them ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>To count themselves already blessed in having those for whom they desire blessing . Tell them that to have loved and given the breast is enough to salve the wounds of loss .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>You are hard , Chisera .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>I am jealous of their griefs . Their very pangs I envy them . Who is there of mine goes to this war that I should grieve for his wounding or look for his return ?<stage>She looks bitterly toward the women who have crept from the caves to peer from the rocks in the direction of the fighting .</stage>Persuade me no more , Padahoon . I will not do it .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She disappears among the rocks to the left , and PADAHOON turns to the women who crowd around him anxiously .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WACOBA</speaker>
     <p>Has she promised ?</p>

     <p>Will she help us ?</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p>Is it because our gifts are so small ? She should consider how hard it is to get venison in war-time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>Her heart is so full of bitterness that there is no room in it for the gods .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WACOBA</speaker>
     <p>That is Simwa 's doing — though he is your son , Seegooche , I must say it — there was no better Chisera between here and Tehachappi until he curdled her wisdom with his lies .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TIAWA</speaker>
     <p>Ah , Simwa ! I spit upon his name .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The women spit between their teeth with sharp hisses .</stage>
    <sp>

     <speaker>WOMEN</speaker>
     <p>Ai ! Ai ! On him and us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>And hate would have been satisfied to strip him of his honors , but now she lets the whole tribe go down in the ruin of her love .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WACOBA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hopefully .</stage>Then if she loves him , perhaps he can persuade her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>As well persuade the rattlesnake not to strike him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SEEGOOCHE</speaker>
     <p>If the Chief should insist , she would not dare refuse .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>There is little she would not dare . But you can try .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Can he command the sap to rise or bid the deer-weed spring when there is no rain ? My power is gone from me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>Chisera , it is a grave matter to refuse service in time of war — be advised by the word of a friend —</p>

     <p>Has the Chisera indeed a friend ?</p>

     <p>Have I not proved —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Padahoon , when did you ever visit me for any but your own advantage ? For what else did you stir me against Simwa , and why now do you seek my blessing but to make good against him the honor of which he has robbed you ? Does any one of you bring me venison except for profit or grind my meal for love ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>

    <stage>Enter CHIEF RAIN WIND , stumbling blindly , led by his wife and followed at a respectful distance by the other women .

Great powers have been given you to turn the favor of the gods as a willow is turned in the wind . How is it you have not turned them when your people are in war and bad fortune ? We are driven as hunted rabbits to hide in holes in the rocks , and our fighting men are outnumbered ; even now we do not know if there be one left alive of them — Our tribe shall be as a forgotten tale unless you intercede for us .</p>

     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>Well , I believe in the medicine of Tibu . He has made old women of you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
     <p>Think no more of that . Let us consider what is to be done .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Shadows of vultures appear on the rocks , attracted by the dead . WACOBA springs up from casting dust upon her head to flap them away with her blanket , which she spreads over the body of her husband .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p><stage>As he motions to the men to move the body near the shelter .</stage>Yes , it is time to take counsel when the birds of the air betray us to our enemies .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The women gather together about the dead . One of them takes the place of the sentry who comes to Council . The men collect near the CHISERA 'S hut with the exception of SIMWA , who remains seated , re-stringing his bow . BRIGHT WATER goes to him .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BRIGHT WATER</speaker>
     <p>Simwa , how long will you let your pride destroy us ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>Is that a word for a man 's wife ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BRIGHT WATER</speaker>
     <p>It is a true one . Do we not know , you and I , that it is but pride that makes you stand out against the friend of the gods ? Look at me , Simwa , is it not proved on my body that she spoke truly when she said that you throve only by her blessing ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>Can you bear to admit so much ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BRIGHT WATER</speaker>
     <p>Bear ? What have I not borne ? Have I complained when I dig roots ? Have I quivered when I was mocked ? Has there been any sign of shame on my face for all the scorne on theirs ? Have I said , “ Give me children ,” when the nursing mothers pitied me ? Oh , I have borne , I have borne ; but this I cannot bear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>What is now so hard ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BRIGHT WATER</speaker>
     <p>To know that you and I know the truth and that you will see the tribe wiped out before you will admit it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>The truth ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BRIGHT WATER</speaker>
     <p>That you were the Chisera 's lover for the sake of what she could do for you , and your denial left her no way to prove it except by taking away the help of the gods from us all . Is not that the truth ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>Would you have me ashamed before all men ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BRIGHT WATER</speaker>
     <p>When have I not been ashamed since I married you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>Let her alone ! They will kill her if she refuses to make medicine and then we shall be rid of her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BRIGHT WATER</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>And you would permit that ?</l>
      <stage>He shifts uneasily under her gaze .</stage>
      <l>Simwa —</l>
      <stage>With profound entreaty .</stage>
      <l>Simwa !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>What is the witch to me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BRIGHT WATER</speaker>
     <p>My sister , I think , for she has loved you even as I have , to my sorrow .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She turns away from him meditating some deep purpose , and from this time on the progress of that purpose in her mind is evident in her bearing toward her husband .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Coming forward .</stage>
      <l>Let the Council sit .</l>
      <stage>They sit as in ACT I .</stage>
      <l>Simwa , as war leader , what plan have you ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>It wants not plans so much as men to do them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
     <p>Whatever is in any man 's mind for the good of the tribe , let it be delivered . Observe not the rule of the elders , but speak at once .<stage>A moment , during which black looks are cast at SIMWA .</stage>Will no one speak ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>Chief and tribesmen , once I gave counsel and you despised it —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
     <p>No more of that . Give counsel now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>It is the same counsel , but time has not mended the occasion . Penned here on the edge of the precipice we can but starve . We must break through our enemies and strike at their women and their stores .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAVWOTS</speaker>
     <p>Every trail is watched . Not so much as a weasel can go in and out from Toorape and they not know it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>With so many watchers , then , they cannot have much of a fighting force at any point . In an hour it will be dark ; we shall go down by Deer Leap with the women and children , and stay not for fighting , but , fleeing for our lives , break through to their villages —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHOCO</speaker>
     <p>But if they move on us to-night ? If the vultures have already betrayed us — even now they may be within earshot ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAVWOTS</speaker>
     <p>If they come up with us before we reach Deer Leap it is to run into the wolf 's mouth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>I have thought of that . To-night they expect us to mourn our dead and go before our gods —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
     <p>So should we .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>That they may think so , leave one behind to sound the medicine drum throughout the night . So they shall fear to attack and expect an easier victory in the morning when we are exhausted with dancing to the gods .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAVWOTS</speaker>
     <p>But he that stays , what shall become of him —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
     <p>He shall die as becomes him<stage>rising</stage>— as becomes a chief of his people .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Murmurs of consternation and then silence .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>But another — whose counsels we prize less —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
     <p>It is the tribal use . None else too blind for the trail and too feeble for the sortie<stage>with grim humor</stage>— but I can drum .<stage>Solemn grunts of approval .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>If we win through Deer Leap , we can make terms for you . Tribesmen , what say you ?<stage>A pause .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAVWOTS</speaker>
     <p>What I say is for myself only ; but I go not out against the Tecuyas again unless the Chisera has blessed the going .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE COUNCIL</speaker>
     <p>Good counsel ; good counsel ! He has it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIMWA</speaker>
     <p>There are two or three things to the making of fighting men , Tavwots , beside the blessing of women .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAVWOTS</speaker>
     <p>Two or three things , Simwa , that I think you have not : honor to win advantage and wit to keep what you have got .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>As for me , I am with Tavwots ; but<stage>he looks at SIMWA</stage>— the gods have no favors for unbelievers .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAVWOTS</speaker>
     <p>Nor have we , by the Bear !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>INDIANS</speaker>
     <p><stage>Springing up .</stage>Nor have we ! No ; by the Bear ! Out with him !<stage>They hustle SIMWA . One snatches off the war-bonnet , another the collar of bears ’ claws . Even the women strike dust upon him with their feet in an excess of contempt .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
     <p>Peace , tribesmen !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TAVWOTS</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps we shall have peace when we have a leader against whom neither the gods nor women have a spite . Tribesmen , who shall lead the going out but he who planned it ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>INDIANS</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>Do not count on me too much with the Chisera ; all this time I have kept in camp with my wound I have reasoned with her , but still she refuses me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
     <p>There shall be an end to that —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>How then —?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
     <p>Who denies service to the tribe in extremity must be dealt with as an enemy .<stage>Consternation .</stage></p>
    </sp>

     <p>But a friend of the gods —</p>

     <speaker>TAVWOTS</speaker>
     <p>Let the gods save her —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
     <p>There are times when the gods must be content to stand still and see what men will do . Who serves not us , serves our enemies . It is the law .</p>

     <p>Are you not respected above all women of the campody ? Even in war-time —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Ah — respect ! What have I to do with respect ? Am I not as other women that men should desire me ? Are my breasts less fair that there should never be milk in them ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
     <p>We honor you after the use of medicine men . What more would you have ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>The dole of women . Love and sorrow and housekeeping ; a husband to give me children , even though he beat me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
     <p>Love you have given , and sorrow you have got . Shame and defeat are your children . So it is always when power falls upon women . The word has passed in Council , Chisera ; will you repair this damage , or will you die for it ?</p>

     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>By whom trouble came into the camp , let it depart . Who prevented the wisdom of the gods at the throwing of the sacred sticks ? By whose counsel were our allies of Castac destroyed ? Who hardened the Chisera 's heart so that she kept not our foes from us ?</p>

     <p>Simwa ! Simwa !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>PADAHOON</speaker>
     <p>Sons of the Bear , do you think to win favor of the gods when you have one who mocks them in your midst ? Would you see the backs of the Tecuyas ? Would you win to your homes again ? Let Simwa die !</p>

     <p>Whether you can bear it or not , it shall be said of you , for though I am unhappy , I am still the Chisera , and I declare unto you that neither the life nor the death of a broken man can avail to turn the gods . But you , Chief Rain Wind , and you tribesmen of Sagharawite ,— if you must visit the loss of my power , let it be on your own heads , for you only are blameworthy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHIEF</speaker>
     <p>This is no time for riddles , Chisera .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>I mean none . What did Simwa other to me than the occasion allowed him ? Was it his fault that he found me alone and love-hungry ? Was it he who ordered that I should live apart where no woman could see how my heart went and give me counsel ? Was it any fault but yours — you that kept me far from your huts lest I should see and carry word to the gods how unworthy you were ! You that feared yourselves lessened when I walked among you with my power — Ai ! Ai ! Did you think at all what became of the woman so long as you had my medicine to help you ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>THE CHISERA</speaker>
     <p>Did ever a woman serve them the less because she had dealt with a man ? Nay , all the power of woman comes from loving and being loved , and now the bitterest of all my loss is to know that I have never had it .</p>

    <p n="35">THE DANCES</p>
    <p n="36">All tribal or emotional occasions among Indians are invariably accompanied by singing and dancing . These are frequently derived from the movements of animals and are both pantomimic and symbolic .</p>
    <p n="37">The object of the medicine dance is to work up the dancer to a state of trance , in which he receives a revelation in regard to the matter under consideration .</p>
    <p n="38">Some of these medicine dances are ritualistic in character and must be performed with great strictness , but in the case of the Chisera the dance is assumed to be made up of various dance elements expressing the emotion of the moment , combined by individual taste and skill .</p>
    <p n="39">Power is supposed to descend upon the dancer as he proceeds . Sometimes the dance lasts for hours , and even for days before the proper trance condition is attained . Even then the revelation may not come until a second or third climax has been reached .</p>
    <p n="40">The blanket dance is common throughout the Southwest , and possibly elsewhere . It is accompanied by a song which says , in effect , “ How lovely it will be when you and I have but one blanket .” By the young people it is not taken any more seriously than “ drop the handkerchief ” and other courtship games .</p>
    <p n="41">COSTUMES</p>
    <p n="42">While the scene of this play is laid among the Paiute peoples , there is nothing which makes it absolutely unlikely among any of the hunting tribes .</p>
    <p n="43">Considerable latitude is therefore permissible in costume and accessories . The only indispensable thing is that all these should be kept within a given culture area . Every article of Indian use or apparel is determined by some condition of living , and it is a mistake to mix costumes from various tribes .</p>
    <p n="44">Concessions must be made to the objections of the modern audience to the state of nudity which would be natural to the time in which the story is laid . But even making allowance for this , the tendency is always to overdo , to have too many beads and fringes and war-bonnets . No more than his white brother did the Indian wear all his best clothes every day .</p>
    <p n="45">The blanket is the most considerable item of Indian equipment . At once by its quality , its color , and its pattern it announces something of the wearer 's rank and condition .</p>
    <p n="46">The way in which it is worn betrays the state of his mind as does no other garment . It is drawn up , shrugged off , swung from one shoulder , or completely shrouds the figure according as his mood runs , or it is folded neatly about the body to get it out of the way of his arms when he has need of them . Blankets would be worn to Council , but not going to battle . They would be worn by young and modest women on public occasions , but by old women only for warmth and protection . They are also worn as an advertisement of the desire for privacy .</p>
    <p n="47">When an Indian is seen completely shrouded in his blanket , standing or sitting a little apart from the camp , he either has a grouch or he is praying . In either case it is not good manners to interrupt him .</p>
    <p n="48">As far as possible the use of the blanket is indicated in the text . Always it may be safely taken as an indication of the wearer 's attitude toward whatever is going on about him .</p>
