SCENE ONE     <stage type="setting">
      <stage>The flat roof of JEREMIAH 'S house ; the white flagstones gleam in the dim moonlight . Below are seen the towers and battlements of sleeping Jerusalem . Nothing stirs , save that from time to time we hear the whispering of the breeze that heralds the dawn .</stage>
      <stage>Of a sudden , impetuous footsteps sound upon the stair . JEREMIAH staggers in ; his robe is torn open at the throat ; he gasps like one being strangled .</stage>

       <speaker>Of a sudden , impetuous footsteps sound upon the stair . JEREMIAH staggers</speaker>
       <p>in ; his robe is torn open at the throat ; he gasps like one being strangled .</p>
      </sp>
     </stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p>They batter in the gates ... to the walls ... to the walls !... Faithless watchmen ... they are coming ... they are upon us .... The temple is in flames .... Help , help !... The walls are breached ....<stage>He has rushed forward to the edge of the roof , where he abruptly stops . His cry rends the shimmering silence . With a start , he awakens from his trance . He looks forth over the town like a drunken man ; his arms , which in his terror he has raised , sink slowly to his sides ; then wearily he draws his hand across his open eyes</stage>Illusion ! Once again these terrible visions . Full , how full , is the House of Dreams !<stage>He leans on the parapet and gazes down</stage>Peace broods over the city ; the country is at peace ; in me alone , in my breast alone , this fire rages . How quietly the town reposes in God 's arms , nestling in slumber , roofed over by peace , the moonbeams falling on every house , and every house plunged in gentle sleep . But I , I alone , am consumed with fire night after night ; I crash earthward with the falling towers , rush to escape , perish amid the flames ; I , and none but I , my bowels troubled , leap heated from my bed and stagger forth into the moonlight seeking coolness ! For me alone comes a vision to shatter sleep ; for me alone does a fiery horror wrench the darkness from my lids . The martyrdom of this vision ; the madness of these faces which swarm in their blood-stained multitude and then fade in the clear moonlight ! Always the same dream , the same illusion . Night after night , the same terror seizes me , the same dream , culminating in the same torment . Who has instilled this dream poison into my veins ? Who hunts me thus with terror ? Who covets my sleep , that he must rob me of it ; who is my torturer , and for whom must I thus hold vigil ? Answer ! Who art thou , invisible one , aiming at me from the darkness thy winged shafts ? Who art thou , terror incarnate , coming to lie with me by night , quickening me with thy spirit until my frame is twisted as with labor pains ? Wherefore in this slumbering city should the curse be laid on me alone ?<stage>He is silent , straining his ear to the all-pervading silence , and then continues with growing excitement</stage>Silence , nothing but silence , while within is unceasing turmoil and storm-tossed night . With scorching talons it tears at my vitals and yet cannot grasp them . I am scourged with visions , and know not who holds the scourge . My cries go forth into the void . Desist , invisible hunter , or if it must be otherwise , seize your quarry ; call to me when I wake , not when I sleep ; speak to me in words , not in visions . Reveal what you are hiding from me ; tell me the meaning of these torments .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>A VOICE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Calling softly from the darkness . It seems to come from far above or far beneath , mysterious in its remoteness</stage>Jeremiah !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p><stage>Staggers as if struck by a stone</stage>Who calls ? Surely I heard my name ? Was it a voice from the stars , or was it the voice of my own dream ?<stage>He listens . All is quiet again</stage>Is it thou , invisible one , who huntest me and tormentest me ? Or is it I myself ; is it the fierce current of my own blood ? Voice , speak once more , that I may know thee . Call to me once again .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE VOICE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Drawing nearer</stage>Jeremiah !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p><stage>Quailing , sinks to his knees</stage>Here am I , Lord ! Thy servant heareth .<stage>Breathless he hearkens . Nothing stirs ; he trembles with emotion</stage>Speak , Lord , to thy servant . Thou didst call my name . Give me thy message that I may understand it . I am ready for thy word and await thy command .<stage>He listens again with strained attention . Profound silence</stage>Is it presumption that I should long for thee ? I am no more than an ignorant fellow , a man of no account , a speck of dust in the world thou hast made , but thine is all power of choice . Thou who choosest kings from among shepherds , and who often unsealest the lips of a boy so that he glows with thy speech , thy choice is made by other tokens . Whom thou touchest , Lord , he is chosen ; whom thou choosest , Lord , he is appointed . If it were thy call which came to me , lo I have hearkened to the call . If it be thou , Lord , who huntest me , I flee thee not . Seize thy quarry , Lord , seize thy prey ; or hunt me yet farther to the goal ! But make thyself known , that I may not fail thee ; reveal the heaven of thy word , that I , thy servant , may behold thee !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE VOICE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Nearer and more urgent</stage>Jeremiah !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p><stage>Rapturously</stage>I hear , Lord , I hear . With all my soul I listen to thy word . Unworthy vessel that I am , I wait to be filled with thy message . I vow myself to thy service , Lord , to thine alone , for my soul is athirst to serve thee . I await thy word and thy sign .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE VOICE OF JEREMIAH 'S MOTHER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Now close at hand and plainly recognizable</stage>Jeremiah !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p><stage>In ecstasy</stage>Show thyself to me , Lord ; my heart is racked with the imminence of thy coming . Pour forth thy waters , holy storm ; plough me up , that I may bear thy seed ; make my earth fruitful , inspire my lips ; brand me with the mark of thy service ! Set thy yoke upon me . See , my neck is bowed in readiness , for thine am I , thine for evermore . Make thyself known to me , Lord , even as I know thee ; let me but see thy glory , even as thou lookest down upon my unworthiness in the gloom ; deign only to show me the way of thy will , point the way to him who is thy servant for ever !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MOTHER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Her search has led her up the stair ; her countenance shows anxiety , her voice is full of tenderness</stage>Here at last I find you , my son .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p><stage>Springing to his feet in fear and wrath</stage>Begone ! Alas the voices are stilled ; the way is lost , never shall I find it again .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>Woe is me , why do you stand here so thinly clad in the chill night air ? Come down , my son . The morning mist brings fever .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p><stage>Wildly</stage>Why do you follow me , why do you pester me ? Unending chase . You follow me without pause , waking or sleeping .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>Jeremiah , what do you mean ? I was sleeping below , and then I seemed to hear people talking on the roof .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p>You heard , you too ? God 's holy truth ! You heard him speak ? Understood his call ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>Whom do you mean ? You have no companion .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p><stage>Seizing her arm</stage>Mother , tell me I beseech you . Death or joy hangs upon your words . Did you hear a voice ; did you hear it after you had awakened ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>I heard a voice on the roof and went to summon you . But your bed was cold and empty . Then fear came upon me , and I called your name .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p><stage>Trembling</stage>You called my name ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>Thrice did I call you . But why ...</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p>Thrice ? Mother , are you certain ...</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>Thrice did I call you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p><stage>His voice breaking</stage>Disaster and derision ! Fraud everywhere , without and within . There came an earnest call , and in my terror I thought it was God .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>How strange you are ! I meant no harm . Since there was no answer , I came to the roof to see if there was anyone here . I found no one .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p>Nay , you found a madman . The torture of these visions ! Sense and nonsense join in cheating me . I am befooled by my own fantasy .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>What are you talking about ? What is troubling you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p>Nothing , Mother , nothing . Pay no heed to my words .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>I must heed them , Jeremiah ; but they are dark to me . An evil mood has beset you , and has estranged you from me . What has happened ; what is tormenting you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p>Nothing is tormenting me , Mother . I was too hot in bed , and sought the roof for coolness .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>You are closing your heart to me , and yet I can read you . I know that night after night for months past you have been wandering about . I have often heard you groaning in your sleep . When you have left your bed to walk restlessly in the darkness , my heart has followed your every step . Tell me your troubles . Shut not yourself away from me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p>Do not concern yourself about it , Mother .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>How can I help but concern myself about it ? Are you not the day of my days and the prayer of my nights ? You have outgrown the arms which used to carry you ; but I still hold you in my soul , which watches over your life . I knew , ere you yourself were aware ; I saw months ago , before you yourself had seen . I saw the shadow upon your brow and the anguish of your soul . You have become a stranger to your friends ; you shun merrymakings ; you keep away from the marketplace and from the dwellings of men . Buried in thought , you renounce life . Jeremiah , bethink yourself . You were trained for the priesthood . Your father 's mantle awaits you , that you may praise the Lord with psaltery and song . Look forth from the darkness into the daylight . The hour has come for you to begin your life 's work .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p>Not now the time for beginnings . The end draws nigh .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>It is time ! It is time ! Long since have you grown to manhood . The house has need of a wife , and of children to raise up seed to your father .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p><stage>In bitter distress</stage>Lead a wife home to desolation ? Beget children for the slaughter ? In sooth , it is not the bridal hour that approaches !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>I do not understand .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p>Shall I build a house in the abyss ? Shall I build my life in death ? Shall I sow corruption , and sing the praises of disaster ? I say unto you , Mother , blessed is he whose heart is now free from ties to the living , for whosoever breathes this day is already drinking the waters of death .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>What mad fancy has seized you ? When were the times more propitious ? When was the land more peaceful ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p>No , Mother , the fools say : Peace , Peace . But their words do not bring peace . They lie down to sleep unheeding , and as they sleep they are on their way to death . A time is coming such as Israel has never yet known , a war such as the world has never yet seen . The living will covet the peace of the dead in their graves , and those who can see will envy the darkness with which the blind are stricken . Not yet can the fools see , not yet is it manifest to the dreamers ; but I have beheld it night after night . Higher leap the flames , nearer comes the foe ; the day of tumult and destruction is at hand ; war 's red star is rising on the night .</p>

       <l>A word has come to me in secret ,</l>
       <l>For I have seen faces in the night ,</l>
       <l>I have wandered in my dreams .</l>
       <l>Fear and dread fell upon me ,</l>
       <l>I trembled in every limb ,</l>
       <l>And like a crumbling wall</l>
       <l>My heart fainted within me .</l>
       <l>Mother ,</l>
       <l>Such sights have I seen ,</l>
       <l>That , if they were written ,</l>
       <l>Men 's hair would stand on end ,</l>
       <l>And sleep would depart from them</l>

      <speaker>THE MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>Evil is he who dreams such dreams , and seven times an evildoer he who believes them . Alas that I should have lived to see this day when my own blood is fearful for Zion and has lost faith in the Lord ! Jeremiah , do you wish me to curse the womb that bore you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p>The horror came upon me against my will ; naught could I do to ward off the faces .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>Watch and pray against them and shatter their lies in the name of the Lord . Forget not , Jeremiah , that you are an anointed and consecrated son , that your voice should praise the Lord , that you should uplift the hearts of the sorrowful and fill with hope the minds of the despairing !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p>How can I ? My own despair is the greatest of all . Leave me , Mother , leave me !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>I will not leave you , neither will I abandon your soul to despair . Jeremiah , my only son , hearken to me . For the first time let me tell you something which may awaken your courage . Hear the words that are forced from me by my distress . I , too , was once filled with despair , inasmuch as for ten years the Lord had closed my womb . I was the sport of my companions and the mock of the concubines . For ten long years I bore my lot patiently , and had almost given up hope ; but in the eleventh year my heart was kindled , and I went to the house of God to implore him that my womb should bear fruit . Throwing myself on the ground , I watered it with tears , vowing that if a son were vouchsafed me I would devote him to the Lord 's service . I swore to be silent , to utter no word during my time of trial , that my son in days to come might speak abundantly , praising God .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p>You also consecrated me , Mother ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>The selfsame day your father knew me and I was blessed with you . Hearken , Jeremiah . For nine months did I faithfully refrain from speech that you might speak abundantly , that you might glorify the everlasting God ! Thus did I fulfil my vow , and we brought you up to read the scripture , and sweetly did you sing to the psaltery . Know , then , that from the first you were a consecrated priest and devoted to the service of the Lord . Rend the veil of your dreams and come forth into the daylight .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p>A double consecration , Mother , a twofold witness of this night . A second time you have called me to life . Through your words the light has come to me , for , wonderful to relate , I cried my question to God and he sent you to speak to me ! Now do I know who knocked on the wall of my sleep until I awakened from my life 's slumber ; now do I know who summoned me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>What has befallen you ? Your words are like those of a drunken man .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p>Yea , drunk am I now with the certainty of his will ; so full am I of speech , that the words must forth . The seals upon my mouth are broken , and my lips burn to utter the revelation .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>Woe is me if you should reveal your mad dreams . You are no son of mine if you cry such fancies aloud !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p>Your son , Mother ? Indeed and indeed I am your son , with a fate like unto yours ! Learn that I too have been barren , and that the Lord hath quickened me with a word and a secret . I have renewed your vow , Mother , and have given myself to the Lord .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>Go , then , to God 's house . Give yourself to him who has called you , praise his holy name .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p>Nay , Mother , not for me the service of the sacrificial priest . I myself must be the sacrifice . For God my veins run blood ; for him my flesh is consumed ; for him my soul burns . I will serve him as none ever served him before ; his paths shall henceforward be mine . Behold the dawn upon the valley , and within me likewise is darkness dispelled by light ! God 's heaven flames , and in me no less the heart is aflame . Chariot of Elijah , fiery chariot , carry my words that they may fall like thunder into the hearts of men . My lips scorch me , I must go , I must go .</p>

I went forth from the house full of shame for my own terrors ; I sought the marketplace that I might rejoice in its peace . But when I came thither I heard shouts of exultation ; and my heart broke within me , for the shouts were clamors for war . Brothers , my soul was bitter as gall , and the words came to my lips against my will . Tell me , is war so precious that you should praise it ? Is it so kindly that you should long for it ? Does it bring so much good that you should greet it with all the warmth of your heart ? I say unto you , people of Jerusalem , that war is a fierce and evil beast , one that devours the flesh of the strong and sucks the marrow of the mighty , crushing towns in its jaws and trampling the land beneath its hoofs . Those who awaken it , shall not again lay it to sleep ; and he who draws the sword , is like to perish by the sword . Woe , therefore , to the contentious man who quarrels when there is no need , for he shall come out upon one way , and flee upon seven . Woe to those who murder peace with the words of their mouth .

Fire and water keep their appointed places , the storehouses are well filled , and God has his spacious mansion .

Day by day you must wrest it from the mouths of liars and from the hearts of men . You must stand alone against the multitude ; for clamor is always on the side of the many , and the liar has ever the first word .

     <stage>KING ZEDEKIAH , followed by the Egyptian envoys , has come out of the palace . He bears a drawn sword . His expression is grave . Amid the exultant crowd he seems oppressed with thought . Scarcely heeding the tumult and the acclamations , he makes for the temple with slow strides . Suddenly , above the clamor of the multitude , rises the voice of JEREMIAH</stage>

     <stage>The voice of JEREMIAH is drowned amid the general uproar . He is thrust aside , and BARUCH has difficulty in protecting him . With redoubled energy the crowd continues to shout in an ecstasy around the king . ZEDEKIAH stands awhile , still trying to find the one who had called on him to sheathe the sword . For a moment , indeed , he lowers his weapon , and seems to be looking round for help . But , amid fanatical cries of the populace , the gates are opened . After a moment 's further hesitation , ZEDEKIAH raises his sword once more , and with earnest mien mounts the last steps and disappears into the temple</stage>

May I be thy victim Lord , and not this city . Let me disappear into the darkness of oblivion , if thy towers may still shine , O Jerusalem . May my words vanish like smoke , so long as thou endurest , eternal city . God forget me , if he will but remember thee .

      <p>The sound is very faint , but the breeze bears it to us . When I was in Joppa , for the first time I heard in the night the distant murmur of the waves . Such a sound rises now from the plain . They are there in their thousands , moving quietly , but the air is stirred by the rolling wheels and the clashing arms . A whole nation must be afoot , falling upon Israel . The noise echoes from our walls like the noise of the sea .</p>

      <p>Why does God hurl the nations against one another ? There is room for all beneath the skies . There is still plenty of land unploughed ; many forests still await the axe . Yet men turn their ploughshares into swords , and hew living flesh with their axes . I cannot understand , I cannot understand .</p>

      <p>The nations want war for its own sake .</p>

      <speaker>SECOND SENTRY</speaker>
      <p>What are nations ? Are not you one of our nation , am not I another ? Are not our wives , your wife and mine , part of this same people ? Did any of us want war ? I stand here armed with a spear , not knowing against whom it is to be turned . Down there in the darkness , unwitting , waits the man for whom it is destined . I know him not , have never seen his face , or the breast I must pierce with death . In the enemy 's camp another perchance warms his hands at the camp fire , the man who is to kill the father of my children . He has never seen me , and I have never done him harm . We are strangers , like trees in the forest . They grow quietly and bear their blossoms . But we rage furiously one against the other with axe and with spear , until our blood runs like resin , and therewith the life oozes forth . What puts death between the nations ? What is it which sows hatred when there is room and to spare for life , and when there is abundant scope for love ? I cannot understand , I cannot understand !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FIRST SENTRY</speaker>
      <p>These things must be God 's will , for they have always happened . I question no further .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SECOND SENTRY</speaker>
      <p>This crime cannot be God 's will . He has given us our lives that we may live them . Everything that men do not understand they describe as God 's will . War does not come from God . Whence comes it then ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FIRST SENTRY</speaker>
      <p>How can I tell whence it comes ? I know that there is war , and that it is useless to chatter about it . I do my duty ; sharpen my spear , not my tongue .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>For a time they are silent once more , gazing out into the white stillness . From a great distance come the words of the challenge ‚Äú Samson guard us , ‚Äù scarcely audible at first . Then the sound grows louder , still coming from unseen sentries . At length the words ‚Äú Samson guard us , ‚Äù loud and clear from the next post . Our two sentries take up the challenge , and it is heard with diminishing loudness as it passes on round the wall . Again all is still . The two sentries stand silent in the moonlight , their faces shadowed by their helmets</stage>

      <speaker>FIRST SENTRY</speaker>
      <p>I have been told that they are cruel as wild cats and venomous as serpents . It is said that they sacrifice their children to idols of copper and lead . But I have never set eyes on a Chaldean .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SECOND SENTRY</speaker>
      <p>Nor I . Too many mountains tower skyward between Jerusalem and Babylon ; there are rivers to cross , and more country than a man can march over in many weeks . The very stars in the sky are different , and yet the men of Ashur are arrayed against us and we against them . What do they covet from us ? If I were to question one of them , all he could tell me would doubtless be that in his house as in mine are wife and children lying upon straw . I believe if I could talk things over with such a man we should understand one another well enough . Often I feel that I should like to summon one of them , to hold out a friendly hand , so that we could have a heart to heart talk .</p>

      <p>How can a man help questioning himself ? How can he be other than uneasy , at such an hour ? Do I know where I am , or how long I have still to stand on guard ? This darkness beneath the wall , where the masonry is crumbling , will perhaps be my grave to-morrow . Maybe the wind which now caresses my cheek will not find me here in the morning . But can I fail , while I live , to ask the meaning of life ? The flame flickers until the torch goes out . How can life do other than question until it is quenched by death ? Maybe death is already within me ; perchance the questioner is no longer life , but death .</p>

Touch my hand that I may know whether I wake or sleep . Are my eyes open ? Is this wall builded of stones or of tears ? Does Jerusalem lie behind us unheeding in the darkness ?

      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p>Alas , it is true , then . I am not dreaming now . The horses are there and the chariots ; Ashur is arrayed against Zion ; the vision is fulfilled . All these miseries spring from my dreams , for they existed in me before they were in the world of reality . I alone knew , before ever God 's words became deeds . In me they arose ; through me they came . Yet naught can I do to hinder their flow ; nor by sword nor by shield can I stay their progress .</p>

      <p>Why was all this made plain to me before the day ? It cannot be against God 's will that he should disclose his plans to me , should vouchsafe me visions of the future . Nor can I rebel ; nor can I be silent ; though in truth for long I refused the summons , and stopped my ears to the call . But now , when I see in the real world what has again and again been revealed to me in dreams , for the first time do I feel assured that God speaks through me . I say to you , Baruch , that I am the chosen of the Lord . Woe unto me should I conceal my forebodings from the people and from the king . For this is no more than the beginning , and I know the end .</p>

      <p>You see the night , sleep , and the false quiet of repose . But in my ears the trumpets blare and the arms clash as the Chaldeans arise and storm the city . The walls whereon our feet are now planted , crumble at their onslaught ; the cries of the fugitives ring in my ears . The brazen flood foams over us . I hear the beating of Death 's wings o'er city and walls ; I see the destruction of Zion . Baruch , waking I see it , for God hath opened an eye within the darkness of my body ; my heart maketh a noise in me ; my soul hath heard the sound of the trumpet , the alarm of war . Why sleep they still ? Time is it they should wake , ere their sleep pass into death . Verily the hour is come to awaken Jerusalem !</p>

A people countless in numbers is encamped round Israel . Spears are leveled ; hands are raised ; even in sleep , their dreams turn against us . To-morrow they will all arise as the herbage rises after rain ; stillness will be replaced by the screams of death . This is perchance the last night of peaceful slumber .</p>

Kneel before Nebuchadnezzar , even as I kneel before thee . Open the gates , and open thy heart . Abase thyself , King Zedekiah , for it is better thou shouldst be abased than that Israel should be laid low .</p>

      <p>At times she has suspected , but I have been able to calm her fears . Yesterday , when the first rams were at work , she was alarmed by the cries of the populace . Throwing off the coverlet , she wrung her hands , and declared she must forth to the walls , that war had come , that the enemy was in the city , that Zion was perishing . Her son 's prophecy was being fulfilled , the king of the north had come . She struggled to her feet . Then her knees gave way beneath her . I caught her as she fell , bore her back to bed , and persuaded her that it was all a dream , that the shouting and the hosannas were but the illusion of fever . She seemed to believe me , lying with open eyes , and listening to the muffled clamor from the street .</p>

      <p><stage>Not moving , his hands still clenched</stage>I dare not , I dare not . Disaster dogs my footsteps . Curses go before me . Let me stand thus apart , lest my breath harm you , lest it strike terror to your soul .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p>Nay , Mother , the curse stands , and all the streets are filled with it . It rebounds from the wall of every house , attacks me from all men 's mouths . No longer am I your son , no longer living flesh , but the mock of the world , an outcast from my people , hated by the righteous , forgotten by God , loathed by myself . To myself leave me . Let me remain in the darkness , most accurst of all men .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MOTHER</speaker>
      <p>My child , were you indeed the rejected of all men , banned by the priests , outlawed by the people ; had God himself thrust you away from the light of his countenance ; still were you my son , blood of my blood for evermore . I will love you for their hatred , and bless you for their curse . If they have spit upon you , come that I may kiss you ; if they have cast you out , come that I may take you in ; home , come home to my heart . Sweet to me is the bitterness of your lips , sweet the salt of your tears ; blessed is all that you do ; if only you return to my mother 's heart .</p>

     </sp>
     <stage>The mother folds him in her arms , and clasps him without speaking for a time . Tremblingly she strokes his head and his body again and again . At length , as she looks at him , a strange glow of happiness lights up her face , and she speaks to him in a plaintive chant</stage>

      <p>And your men , old stalwart ; are they , too , stout-hearted ? Rarely do I hear them raise exultant cries . When I pass among them , no longer do they strike their shields . They turn away their faces .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ABIMELECH</speaker>
      <p>War makes men silent , but it steels their hearts . No longer , indeed , do they shout with delight , for that they can use their swords freely . Custom stales all joys . But they watch and wait ; strong as brass are they , guarding the walls of Jerusalem .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>But what if the moons still wax and wane ; what if the second year of the siege begins ? There is no help coming from outside .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ABIMELECH</speaker>
      <p>The siege will last as long as God pleases , and we shall last as long as the siege .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HANANIAH</speaker>
      <p>Never shall Nebuchadnezzar overthrow us . Woe unto all faint-hearts . Did it rest with me , I would put them to the sword .</p>

      <speaker>IMRE</speaker>
      <p>Mine eyes are dim with age , but being old , I saw the days when Senaccherib was arrayed against Israel , and I saw his men lying dead in heaps around our walls . Never were the jackals so fat as in the year when Jerusalem was encircled by the enemies of the Lord . The same may happen again to those who now besiege us . Let mine eyes not be wholly darkened ere this day dawn . Jerusalem endureth for ever !</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>Thou sayest nothing , Nahum . Wherefore art thou silent ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NAHUM</speaker>
      <p>Gloomy are my thoughts , Lord King , and bitter will be my speech . He thrusts not himself forward , to whom joy is lacking .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>I summoned you in council , one and all . Welcome is the bearer of good tidings , but no less welcome he who brings wise warnings . Speak freely .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NAHUM</speaker>
      <p>Shortly before you called me to the council , I was visiting the storehouses , and having the grain measured , bushel by bushel . They were full when the siege began , but now they are almost empty . No longer can we provide a whole loaf for the day 's ration .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>All sit in dismayed silence</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>Was there not ample provision of grain from the villages ? Was not an abundance of milch cows and other beasts driven within the walls ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NAHUM</speaker>
      <p>Forget not that the siege has lasted nearly a year , and that there are many mouths to feed .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p><stage>After another pause</stage>We can reduce the rations yet further . Let nothing be wasted .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NAHUM</speaker>
      <p>Long have we been careful to avoid waste . Yet the storehouses gape with emptiness . Time is a mighty eater .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>How long , then , thinkest thou , ere famine is upon us ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p>Three weeks ... And then ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NAHUM</speaker>
      <p>How can I answer thee , O King ? God alone knows the answer .<stage>Renewed silence</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HANANIAH</speaker>
      <p><stage>In great excitement</stage>Cut the loaves in half . Cut them in three , and let that suffice for the day . Too long have they lived riotously , they and their concubines ; let them grow lean , now , fighting the Lord 's fight .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ABIMELECH</speaker>
      <p>My soldiers must not have their food cut down . No man can fight on an empty stomach .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HANANIAH</speaker>
      <p>We must all share and share alike , the soldiers as well as the others . Jerusalem is at stake .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ABIMELECH</speaker>
      <p>My men must have their strength kept up . Let the useless mouths go hungry , the windbags and the prattlers .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NAHUM</speaker>
      <p>You talk folly . What would it avail to pinch ourselves unduly , seeing that there are an hundred thousand within the walls . There is food to last us three weeks . If we slaughter the beasts reserved for the temple , we can hold out a fortnight more .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASHUR</speaker>
      <p>Let us keep the peace among ourselves . Ye rail against one another like enemies . Let us stand united against Nebuchadnezzar and likewise against our own people . Neither he nor they must know aught of our need .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>What if he know it already ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NAHUM</speaker>
      <p>None can know it . Daily I set my seal on the doors of the storehouses . Neither the people nor Nebuchadnezzar can be aware of our distress .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ABIMELECH</speaker>
      <p>God be praised . Nebuchadnezzar would show us no mercy if he knew .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p><stage>After a pause</stage>I have called you in council , elders of the people . Wars are not ended by the sword alone . I have summoned you to ask whether I should send an envoy to Nebuchadnezzar , praying him that there should be peace between our nations .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HANANIAH</speaker>
      <p>No peace with the blasphemers of the Almighty !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ABIMELECH</speaker>
      <p>Let him make the first offer .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASHUR</speaker>
      <p>I think it would be dangerous for us to begin . Should we open the parley , he would seek to make slaves of us .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>I hold other views . Though as yet he knows nothing of our desperate plight , it can remain hidden for a few days only . We must turn these days to account .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NAHUM</speaker>
      <p>True are thy words , O King . We must seek mercy of Nebuchadnezzar before he triumphs over us with the sword .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ABIMELECH</speaker>
      <p><stage>Bitterly</stage>Sue for mercy ! Death were better !</p>

      <p>We need God 's mercy , not man 's .</p>

      <speaker>IMRE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Wearily</stage>When will you cease quarreling ? The king 's words are true . It would be folly to wait till the last hour . Let us seek parley while we can still show a bold front .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ABIMELECH</speaker>
      <p>It is too late . The dead lying before the walls will cry reproach on us .</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>Nay , it is not too late .<stage>He pauses for a moment</stage>An envoy has already passed between Nebuchadnezzar and me .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>The councilors spring excitedly to their feet</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NAHUM</speaker>
      <p>Thou hast received an envoy from Nebuchadnezzar ? Blessed be the hour .</p>
     </sp>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASHUR</speaker>
      <p>Thou hast held parley , King , without consulting us ? Why then are we summoned in council ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>Peace , peace . Can ye not wait till I have finished ? Ye snap at my first word like a pack of hungry hounds .<stage>A pause . He continues more quietly</stage>A messenger has come from Nebuchadnezzar . I have not yet heard the message . Is this to hold parley ? Is this treachery ? Answer !</p>

     <stage>All are silent for a while</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PASHUR</speaker>
      <p>I crave thy pardon , King . It is hard to weigh one 's words when so much hangs in the balance .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>It is for you to decide ; for you to hear the envoy , or to send him away unheard .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NAHUM</speaker>

      <p>We can listen to his message , and be cautious about accepting it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ABIMELECH</speaker>
      <p>We can hear him , and can settle afterwards whether we will let him return . He may be sent only to spy out the land .</p>

      <speaker>BARUCH</speaker>
      <p>When the Assyrian soldiers waylaid me , they took me to the king 's tent . Nebuchadnezzar has kept me under guard these eleven months . Sending for me yesterday , he said : ‚Äú Wilt thou take my message to King Zedekiah ? ‚Äù Standing before him without fear , I answered : ‚Äú I will . ‚Äù Then spake Nebuchadnezzar : ‚Äú Eleven months have I laid siege to this town . I have sworn that not again will I lie with woman until the gates of Jerusalem have been opened . But I will wait no longer . Should King Zedekiah wish for terms , let him hasten . Never has an enemy withstood me more stoutly . To none will I be more gentle than to him , should he hasten to sue for mercy . ‚Äù</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ABIMELECH</speaker>
      <p>Nebuchadnezzar is a great warrior . It is an honor to have held out against him for eleven months .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BARUCH</speaker>
      <p>He said further : ‚Äú If ye open the gates and humble yourselves ere the moon be full , I will grant you your lives . Every man may dwell in safety under his vine and under his fig tree . Though ye have shed our blood , I seek not yours , but only victory and renown . It is my will that from sunrise to sunset the nations should learn the news that none can withstand my sword ; that there is no king but shall bow before me , the king of kings . I need but a sign , and your city shall be safe , your days long in the land . ‚Äù</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BARUCH</speaker>
      <p>He said : ‚Äú Zedekiah , who has taken up arms against me , must abase himself . When I enter the city , let him walk to meet me , from the gates of the temple to the wall , carrying his crown in his hands , and wearing a wooden yoke on his neck ... ‚Äù</p>

He shall walk at my left hand , that men may know I honor him as my royal brother . But there is still one within your walls , of whom folk say that he is mightier than any . I would see this mighty one . They say that there is a god within your walls , whose countenance ye hide behind the curtains of a tabernacle , for that no one can bear to look upon him . To me , fear is unknown , and I wish to enter his presence , that I may behold him . I will not lay hands on his altar , nor touch his bread , neither will I covet his treasures . One thing only do I ask , that I may enter his tabernacle , for I would fain set eyes on him who hath proved mightier than I . ‚Äù Thus spake Nebuchadnezzar .</p>

     </sp>
     <stage>BARUCH stands by the doorway while ZEDEKIAH walks restlessly to and fro for a time . Then , pausing by the window , the king stares over the town , subsequently resuming his restless pacing . At length he turns and speaks to BARUCH</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>Nebuchadnezzar demands an answer to-day ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BARUCH</speaker>
      <p>Yea , Lord ; for to-morrow the moon is full .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p><stage>Paces the floor again . Then abruptly</stage>Thou sawest him face to face . Did he ask thee anything concerning me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BARUCH</speaker>
      <p>His chief counselor and his scribe were present . The former asked me about you , but Nebuchadnezzar bade him be silent .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>Full of pride is he , and his wrath is like a storm over our heads . But I fear him not . Himself , he asked nothing concerning me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BARUCH</speaker>
      <p>Nothing , Lord King .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>To him we are naught . To him our walls are but a handful of dust . Yet we can meet defiance with defiance . For eleven months he has been breaking his teeth against the ramparts of the city , and he would dismiss us with a smile . I am not worth a word , and he rates our town at a breath . Nevertheless my yoke is not yet ready ; the walls of Jerusalem still stand . We have taught him to wait , but he has not yet learned his lesson . Shall I be the slave of his caprices ? He would tarry but a day ? Let him tarry for weeks and months .<stage>Drawing himself up</stage>Take this message to Nebuchadnezzar . Say unto him ...</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BARUCH</speaker>
      <p><stage>In alarm</stage>Decide not in anger , King Zedekiah .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p><stage>Rigid with astonishment</stage>How darest thou interrupt me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BARUCH</speaker>
      <p><stage>Kneels</stage>I implore thee , save Jerusalem . Stretch forth thine hand in peace , lest the walls crumble and the temple be shattered . Lord King , I adjure thee , open the gates , open thy heart .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p><stage>Wrathfully</stage>‚Äú Open the gates , open thy heart ‚Äù . I have heard those words before . They have been put into thy mouth . One stands behind thee speaking against me with thy voice .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BARUCH</speaker>
      <p>Nay , Lord King . My supplication arises from the depths of my heart . Something will I tell thee , which hitherto I have withheld . It was not at Nebuchadnezzar 's summons that I went to him , but of my own free will , hoping that I might soften his heart . I saw that either side waited for the other to propose peace . Day after day , for eleven long months , did I importune him till he sent me with this message .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>Thou , a boy , a child ? While we were holding counsel , thou soughtest out the king of kings to seek peace and ensure it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BARUCH</speaker>
      <p>This did I , O King , in the urgency of my heart 's wishes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p><stage>Regards him fixedly for a time . Then , speaking sharply</stage>Not thine own deed , this , nor thy thought .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BARUCH</speaker>
      <p>I went at no man 's orders .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>Thou speakest falsely . No boy could conceive such a deed for himself .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BARUCH</speaker>
      <p>I swear to thee that I did it unadvised . He knew naught of it , neither commanded it nor approved .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>He ? Who is he of whose orders thou speakest ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BARUCH</speaker>
      <p><stage>Evasively</stage>My teacher , my master .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>Who is thy master , who ? I would know who issues commands to the boys of this city .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BARUCH</speaker>
      <p>God 's servant and prophet is my master . Men call him Jeremiah .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p><stage>Furiously</stage>Jeremiah , always Jeremiah . Ever the shadow that follows my deeds , ever in revolt against me . I have cast him into a dungeon , but still , as in the beginning , rises his clamor for peace . Why this persecution ? Why ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BARUCH</speaker>
      <p>Thou art mistaken . Jeremiah hath more love for thee than for any other in this town .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>I need not his love . I spew forth his love , and I despise his anger . Who is he , that he should dare to love me ? Shall one venture to stand up in the streets and give tongue , declaring that he loveth me , or loveth me not ? Why should Jeremiah push in twixt me and my resolve ? Would he show himself the greater of us twain ? I am the king , I alone ! Let him cry , Peace , peace ! Not in his hand lieth the fate of Jerusalem . I am king in Zion , and never shall he boast that he frightened me with his dreams . Better the city should perish , than be saved by the hand of Jeremiah . Go thou to Nebuchadnezzar and say unto him : Never will Zedekiah bear a yoke . Never shall the king of Ashur raise the curtain before the holy of holies . Nebuchadnezzar may come with all his men ; he will find Zedekiah ready to meet him .<stage>BARUCH raising both hands imploringly , is about to speak . ZEDEKIAH continues</stage>Not a word . If thou failest to carry my message , I will have Jeremiah 's head .<stage>Again BARUCH endeavors to speak</stage>A single word , and Jeremiah 's life is forfeit . Away , I command thee , away !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>BARUCH stands for a moment , and then , veiling his face , passes out . ZEDEKIAH draws himself up threateningly when BARUCH hesitates . As soon as the young man has gone , the king lowers his outstretched arm , and his countenance is once more shadowed with anxiety . Then he draws a deep breath and speaks</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>It is finished . No longer the torture of indecision .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He paces to and fro once more . Then he stamps twice . JOAB enters</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOAB</speaker>
      <p>The king calls ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>Wine , bring me wine . I need sleep , deep and dreamless sleep .<stage>JOAB brings a pitcher and fills a silver goblet . ZEDEKIAH empties it at a draught . Then he listens , and his face is again clouded</stage>Who is walking outside there ? I hear footsteps . Does the spy still tarry ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOAB</speaker>
      <p>He has gone forth , Lord . You hear the sentry , my brother Nehemiah .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>Tell him to tread softly when he is on guard outside my bedchamber at night . I need sleep just as much as other men .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOAB</speaker>
      <p>I will see to it , Lord .<stage>He draws aside the curtains of the bed and veils the lamp . Now the only light in the room comes from the pale moonbeams</stage>Shall I read from the scriptures , Lord King , as heretofore ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>Nay , not even the scriptures can help me . I would fain sleep , even as other men sleep . My lids ache and my heart aches likewise .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>JOAB helps him to remove his outer garment . ZEDEKIAH flings himself on the couch</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOAB</speaker>
      <p>God guard thy slumbers , O King .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>JOAB calls NEHEMIAH . Silently the two stand at the head of the bed , motionless figures holding spears . In the moonlight their shadows rise in giant silhouettes on the wall . The only sound is the gentle plashing of a fountain in the court-yard</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p><stage>Springing up with a wild cry</stage>Why do ye whisper together ? Did I not command ye to silence ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOAB</speaker>
      <p><stage>Alarmed</stage>We said nothing , Lord King .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>Some one is talking . Who is it that devours my slumber ? All should sleep , so that I too may sleep . Is there anyone awake in the neighboring rooms ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOAB</speaker>
      <p>No one , Lord King . Nor anywhere throughout the palace .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>So I alone hold vigil . Why should all the burden be laid upon me ? All the walls of the city , all the towers of care ? Get me wine .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>JOAB fills the goblet once more . ZEDEKIAH drains it and flings it away . With a groan he lies down again . All is still save for the murmur of the fountain . ZEDEKIAH , who has been lying motionless on the bed , now very quietly sits up in the gloom . Crouching like a wild beast about to spring , he listens intently . Then he suddenly screams</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>Some one is speaking . I hear a voice which drones unendingly . I have given orders that none shall speak in my house . The voice is chanting . But I have forbidden that any should sing under my roof . Do ye not hear it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOAB</speaker>
      <p>I hear nothing , Lord .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NEHEMIAH</speaker>
      <p>No sound has reached me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p><stage>Glares at the two lads . Crouching he listens for a moment , and breaks forth again</stage>I hear it , I tell you ; an interminable monotone . Listen , Joab , here where I am listening . It is somewhere beneath us , burrowing like a mole in the darkness of my slumber , devouring my sleep . Canst not hear , lad ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOAB</speaker>
      <p><stage>Listens intently for a moment , and then shudders</stage>I hear a voice rising from the depths . Like the voice of one singing . The spirits of the deep are awake beneath the house . The voice laments and moans like a caged beast .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NEHEMIAH</speaker>
      <p>Perchance it is but the wind moaning through a cranny .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>I hear words ; I feel them without understanding them . Who dares to sing by night in my house ? Is it so well with my slaves that they must sing while I toss sleepless ? Away , Joab , and silence the disturber .<stage>JOAB hastens out . ZEDEKIAH crouches , listening . He seems at first to hear something . Then he raises his head , and subsequently lowers it to listen once more . Suddenly three dull blows are heard . The king listens eagerly . He draws a breath of relief</stage>God be praised , the voice is stilled .<stage>JOAB reenters with troubled mien</stage>Who was talking ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOAB</speaker>
      <p><stage>Trembling</stage>I know not , Lord , I did not find him . As I neared the marketplace , the noise of singing came to me louder , rising as it were from the depths of the earth . I followed the direction of the sound . There was no one singing in the marketplace . The utterance had a hollow ring , as if it came from a well or from a pit . Now I could hear the words , and they were terrible . Thrice did I strike the ground with the haft of my spear . Then was the Gehenna silent .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>What were the words ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOAB</speaker>
      <p><stage>Shuddering</stage>I dare not repeat them .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>Tell me the words , I command thee .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOAB</speaker>
      <p>It was blasphemy that rose from the pit .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>Repeat the words , if you fear my anger .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOAB</speaker>
      <lg>
       <stage>Complies . His voice rises in a psalm</stage>
       <l>I have forsaken mine house ,</l>
       <l>I have cast off mine heritage ;</l>
       <l>I have given the dearly beloved of my soul</l>
       <l>Into the hand of her enemies .</l>
       <l>My tears run down like a river day and night ,</l>
       <l>For grievous is the affliction</l>
       <l>Of the daughter of my people .</l>

      <speaker>JOAB</speaker>
      <lg>
       <stage>Continuing to chant as if inspired</stage>
       <l>He hath given up into the hand of the enemy</l>
       <l>The walls of her palaces ;</l>
       <l>They have made a noise in the house of the Lord ,</l>
       <l>As in the day of a solemn feast .</l>
       <l>He hath ...</l>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>Be still , be still . I will hear no more . Always Jeremiah , and again Jeremiah . Wherever I go he stands at the cross roads ; his challenge rings behind all my doings ; he forces his way into my dreams , and feeds my indecision . How can I outrun this terrible shadow ? He cries to me even from the pit . Who will free me from him ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JOAB</speaker>
      <p>Lord , if he be thine enemy , say the word ...<stage>He makes a movement with his spear</stage></p>

      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p><stage>Startled out of his anger , looks at the lad wonderingly . Then , with awakening pride</stage>Thou wouldst ... Nay , I fear him not . I fear no man . Nor am I certain if he be my enemy . I was foolish , perhaps , to flee from him . Who can tell ?<stage>He paces the room</stage>Joab !</p>

      <p>Go forth , taking with thee thy brother Nehemiah . Open the pit and bring hither the man ye will find there . None must know that he enters and leaves the palace .<stage>JOAB and NEHEMIAH pass out . The king soliloquizes in low tones</stage>At every cross road , behind my back , always too late and always compelling me to listen . Why did I appeal only to God , who vouchsafes me no answer ? Why did I not hearken to those who say that he declares his will through their mouths ? But wherefore do they speak with conflicting voices ? How could I discern the false from the true ? Dread is this God who will not break silence , and whose messengers cannot be certainly known .</p>

     <stage>JEREMIAH enters accompanied by the two lads . At a sign from ZEDEKIAH , JOAB unveils the lamp . Then he and NEHEMIAH withdraw . JEREMIAH is pale and emaciated . His dark eyes flash from a white and bony face , looking almost as if set in a skull . He regards the king with a questioning calm . After a momentary embarrassment the king speaks</stage>

      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>I sent for thee , Jeremiah , to ask why thou dost disturb my rest . Why singest thou in the night when others sleep ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p>He may not sleep who watches over the people . The Lord hath appointed me to watch and to give warning .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>ZEDEKIAH</speaker>
      <p>Jeremiah , I have summoned thee to hold counsel with me . No man knoweth that to this end I have drawn thee from the pit where thou hast been prisoned . Wilt thou advise me truly ?</p>

      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>

      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p>I know thy purpose . With words dost thou fawn on me , whilst thy will is set up against me . Wouldst mock me , and play with God 's word ? Thou hast not summoned me to help thee decide . Long ere this has the message been signed and sealed within thy soul . Thou mayst deceive thyself , King of Israel , but me thou canst not deceive .</p>

Their blood drenches the ground , while thou , in thy pain , Ere the burning steel seareth the sight from thine eyes , Seest how Israel 's race and kingship dies .</p>

      <p>A vast crypt with shutters and doors closed so that the damp underground space is but dimly lighted . Fugitives , wan and careworn , are crouching and lying on the stone flooring . Some of them have gathered round an elder who is reading from the scriptures . In the background lies a wounded man , tended by a woman . Remote from the rest , sitting on a piece of masonry , and as motionless as if he were himself carved out of the rock , is JEREMIAH , his face buried in his hands . He plays no part in what is going on , so that his silence is as it were a rock fixed in the current of plaints and disputes . It is evening , on the day after the taking of Jerusalem . As the elder reads , he sways his body rhythmically in time to the words , which are low and monotonous , except when he raises his voice to express despair or hope . From time to time , the others take up the responses .</p>

      <speaker>THE CHIEF OFFICER</speaker>
      <p>Hail to the interpreter of signs ! Honor and glory to the revealer of events , to the seer of that which is hidden .<stage>Having again abased himself three times , he stands erect ; his companions follow his example . JEREMIAH , recovering composure , regards him gloomily</stage>I bear a message through my unworthy mouth from Nebuchadnezzar , my master , king of kings , destroyer of nations . Thus saith my dread lord . It hath been reported to Nebuchadnezzar that thou alone among thy people foretoldest destruction to the rebels and disgrace to those who goaded on the people to revolt . Melted like lead are the words of the priests who withstood thy strength ; but thy warning , like gold , hath endured the test of time . Thy fame hath reached the ears of Nebuchadnezzar , and now he is eager to set eyes upon thee . He sendeth thee raiment such as is worn by the princes of Chaldea , and will have thee for the chief among his servants who wait at his table .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p>No more will I serve any , either in heaven above or in the earth beneath , for I have served God and have wearied of that service . Say unto Nebuchadnezzar that I refuse to serve him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE CHIEF OFFICER</speaker>
      <p>Thou understandest not the words of my lord and master . Not to any menial service doth he appoint thee , but would have thee to be the chief over all his servants . Master of the magicians , astrologers , and soothsayers , shalt thou be , reading the stars and foretelling that which is to come . Second to none shalt thou be , but shalt come and go in the palace even as thou wilt .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p>I hear your words , and therefrom I learn the king 's wishes . Great is the call of Nebuchadnezzar , but greater is the need of mine own people . Hearken , therefore ! I enter not the palace where the daughters of Israel will scour the steps as bondwomen . No bread do I break as guest at the table of him who hath profaned the temple of Zion . Not for me the favors of the cruel , nor the grace of him who hath been pitiless .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE CHIEF OFFICER</speaker>
      <p>The message I brought thee was a king 's message , and to kings obedience is due .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p>You brought me true word from Nebuchadnezzar . Render him my answer no less truly . Return to him who sent you , and say unto him : ‚Äú Thus saith Jeremiah to Nebuchadnezzar . My bitterness has no sweetness for thee , nor shall my lips minister to thy pride . Wert thou to summon me with the tongues of angels , yet would I not heed thy call ; wert thou to load for me with gold all the stones of Jerusalem , yet would I not speak soft words to thee . Honor me if you wilt , to thee I pay not honor . Seek me if thou wilt , but thee I will not seek . ‚Äù</p>

      <p><stage>Fiercely</stage>Who is he that I should fear him ? Many have there been who bore the proud name of Pharaoh , many whose foreheads were once adorned with circlets of gold , but no man careth to remember their deeds , and no man taketh pen to inscribe their names in the book of time . There have been mightier than he , whom the generations of men have forgotten ere the trees they planted have rotted . Who is Nebuchadnezzar under the stars , that I should fear him ? Is he not a worm , even as other men ? Does not death dog his footsteps , and corruption await his body ? Shall he escape the finger of time ? Think you that he , more than another , can keep that which he now hath , or that he can find an issue from the doom which awaits all the sons of men ? Return , therefore , to your master , bearing from me this message : ‚Äú Woe to the destroyer , for he shall be destroyed ! Woe to the robber , for he shall be robbed . He who has drunk his fill of blood , shall be drowned in blood ; he who has battened on the flesh of the nations , shall himself soon become food for worms ! Hearken ! A wind is rising against Babylon , and a tempest is about to break over Nineveh ! Numbered are the days of Ashur . Drawn is the sword , and it hangs over thee , thy people , and thy realm . Thou art greedy for news of that which is to come . Learn , O Nebuchadnezzar , that Ashur is ripe for destruction ; the measure of thine iniquity is full . ‚Äù</p>

Mighty are his hands ; they will crush Babylon like a bird 's nest , and will scatter the people of Ashur like chaff before the wind . Set watchmen in the towers upon the walls , that they may warn you of his coming ; send forth men in armor , bearing sharp spears , that they may resist his onslaught . Just as little as thou canst blow away the clouds of heaven with thy breath , just so little canst thou avert the coming of the avenger , whose sword will slay the children of Ashur .</p>

Are we not his children , his first-born and his heirs ? Is not his spirit upon us , and his blessing upon the seed of Abraham ? He has chastised us for our sins , but will now have pity on us . What his left hand has taken from us , his right hand will restore a thousandfold . For know , brothers , that sooner shall mountains fall and rivers flow upwards , sooner shall the stars be darkened , than that God shall forget his covenant , shall abandon Israel , shall turn away his face from Zion .</p>

We thought to perish in that darkness , to go down unto death in our anguish . But with the end of his wrath came the beginning of his love . A storm has raged ; God has broken our strength like a reed . But now , once more , the sun of his mercy shines upon us . He has laid aside the lightnings ; he has stilled the thunder of his voice ; his words fall softly on our ears . Sweet do they sound , sweet and gentle : Arise , Jerusalem , Arise , city of affliction . Fear no longer , For I have compassion upon thee . I have been wroth with thee , For a moment I have forsaken thee , But not for ever doth mine anger endure . Therefore , since thou hast been forsaken , Hast been for a day the rejected of God , Now shall thy glories be restored unto thee , And now shalt thou be exalted for all eternity . I will deck thee with my love , And girdle thee with peace , Will show thee the light of my countenance , And bestow my blessing upon thee . Arise , Jerusalem , Arise , For I have delivered thee .</p>

      <p>Lo , she is risen . She has heard the call . The Lord has loosened the fetters from her limbs , and has lifted the yoke from her neck . He has wiped the tears from her cheeks , has consoled the widows and the orphans . Smiles succeed to sorrow . The season of blossoming hath returned . Zion yearns for her children , that they may look upon her in her happiness and rejoice in her renewal . Already have the children of Israel heard the summons of the Lord . Dispersed never so widely to the ends of the earth and among the islands of the sea , yet do they return in their myriads to Zion . From the north and the south , from the east and the west , the happy pilgrims come . Their footsteps hasten across the hills of Gilead , eagerly do they make their way over Bashan and Carmel , that they may see the city of our love , the city of our suffering , the holy fortress of Zion . And Jerusalem rejoices to welcome her children , returned in countless numbers from the prison-houses of exile . Where the flowers were withered , new buds are springing ; where darkness had loomed , there shines fresh light ; those who have been dumb , find voice . Jerusalem has risen from the tomb . The hills nod to her as of old ; the shadows of the mountains lie athwart her plains ; as dew gleams in the meadows , so peace shines in the city , the peace of the Lord , the peace of Israel , the peace of Jerusalem !</p>

      <p>SCENE NINE For I know the thoughts that I think toward you , saith the Lord , thoughts of peace , and not of evil , to give you an expected end . Then shall ye call upon me , and I will hearken unto you . And ye shall seek me , and find me , when ye shall search for me with all your heart . And I will be found of you , saith the Lord : and I will turn away your captivity . JEREMIAH XXIX , 11-14 .</p>

      <speaker>SCENE NINE</speaker>
      <p>The great square in front of the temple , as in the first scene , save that now everywhere signs of the sack are visible . In the square we see a medley of hand-carts laden with household goods , of packhorses and other beasts of burden , and of wagons . Men and women , preparing for the exodus , are busied among these . New groups continually flock into the square from the surrounding streets , and the noise of conversation grows ever louder . The women and children , together with the men too old for work , sit apart on the steps . Chaldean warriors , fully armed , stride masterfully through the crowd , making way for themselves with their spears . The moon shines fitfully . Gradually the dawn reddens in the east .</p>

     <stage>Laughing and shouting , the princes return into the palace , leaving the man of whom they have been making sport swaying unsteadily as he stands at the top of the steps .

      <p>Brothers , I read your suffering like an open book , and the scroll of your pain lies unrolled before me . Natheless , brothers , I see a meaning in this pain and suffering ; I see God therein . The hour is sent to us for trial . Let us meet the test .</p>

      <p>Why should God try us ?‚Äî Why should he visit us , his chosen people , with affliction ?‚Äî Why should he make our burden so heavy ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p>God sends us this trial that we may know him to be God . To those of other nations , few signs are given and little recognition is vouchsafed . They fancy themselves able to see the face of the Eternal in images of wood and stone . Our God , the God of our fathers , is a hidden God ; and not until we are bathed in sorrow are we enabled to discern him . He chooses those only whom he has tried , and to none but the suffering does he give his love . Let us therefore rejoice at our trials , brothers , and let us love the suffering God sends . He has broken us with affliction , that he may sink the deeper into the freshly ploughed ground of our hearts , and that we may be ready for the scattering of his seed . He has weakened our bodies that he may strengthen our souls . Let us joyfully enter the smelting furnace of his will , that thereby we may be purified . Follow the example of your forefathers , and thankfully accept the scourgings of the Almighty !</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p>Brothers , if we believe that we shall arise , already we have arisen . What should we be without faith ? Not to us , as to other nations , has a country been given to which we may cling ; a home , where we may tarry ; rest , that our hearts may wax fat ! Not for peace have we been the chosen among the nations . Wandering is our habitation , trouble our heritage , God our home . Do not for that reason covet your neighbor 's goods ; do not for that reason complain . Leave to others their happiness and their pride ; leave to others an abiding place . For yourselves , people of suffering , gladly accept trial . Have faith , chosen of God , seeing that sorrow is your heritage . Because it is your eternal heritage , therefore are you chosen .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>VOICES</speaker>
      <p>True is the word .‚Äî Sorrow is our heritage .‚Äî I will shoulder my burden .‚Äî I have faith in God 's mercy . He will lead us now , as he led us out of Egypt .‚Äî God will deliver us , as he delivered our fathers .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JEREMIAH</speaker>
      <p>Arise , then , and cease repining . Take up your faith as a staff , and you will march bravely through these trials as you have marched for thousands of years . Happy are we to be vanquished , and happy to be driven from home ; for we are vanquished , we are driven from home , by God 's will . Happy are we to lose all , that we may find him ; happy is our hard lot , gladsome our trial . Kings who mastered us have vanished like smoke ; nations which enslaved us have been scattered and their seed has been destroyed ; towns wherein we served as bondmen have been made desolate , and are now the home of the jackal ; but Israel still lives , ever young , for sorrow is our buttress and overthrow is our strength . Through suffering we have endured the assaults of time ; reverses have ever been our beginning ; and out of the depths God has gathered us to his heart . Think of our former troubles , and how those troubles were met . Think of Egypt , the house of bondage , the first ordeal . Give praise to affliction , ye afflicted ; give praise to trial , ye sorely tried ; praise the name of God who , through tribulation , has chosen us for all eternity !</p>

Scatter your seeds , scatter your seeds , In unknown lands , Through numberless years . Wander your wanderings , watered with tears . On , people of God ; for , wherever ye roam , Your road leads through the world to eternity , home .</p>
