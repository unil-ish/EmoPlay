     <stage>SCENE : GERALD ’ S rooms in Grafton Street . A man ’ s room , pleasantly furnished , with very comfortable arm-chairs , and prints on the walls . Books are lying about , and smoking utensils .</stage>
     <stage>CHARLES , GERALD HALSTANE ’ S servant , opens the door . MR. WRIGHT comes in , a dapper young man , smartly dressed .</stage>
    </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>There , you can see for yourself that Mr. Halstane is not at home .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MR. WRIGHT</speaker>
     <p>Very well , I ’ ll wait for him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>You ’ ll have to wait till midnight , because I don ’ t expect him in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MR. WRIGHT</speaker>
     <p>Last time I came you said he ’ d be back in half an hour , and when I returned you said he ’ d just gone out . You don ’ t catch me napping a second time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>The governor don ’ t take impertinence lying down , Mr. Wright , and he ’ ll look upon it as a great liberty your dunning him in this way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MR. WRIGHT</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t know about taking impertinence , but he ’ ll have to take a summons if my account is not settled at once .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>There is a ring at the bell .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Ironically .</stage>Make yourself quite at home , won ’ t you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MR. WRIGHT</speaker>
     <p>Thank you . I will .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>CHARLES goes out and leaves the door open so that the conversation with RIXON , the solicitor , is heard .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RIXON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Outside .</stage>Is Mr. Halstane in ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>No , sir . He ’ s gone to his club .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RIXON</speaker>
     <p>Well , I ’ ll ring him up . I must see him on a matter of the very greatest importance . You ’ re on the telephone , aren ’ t you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir . But there ’ s a person waiting to see him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RIXON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coming in .</stage>Oh , never mind .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>RIXON is a short , rubicund man , with white whiskers and a hearty manner .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MR. WRIGHT</speaker>
     <p><stage>Going towards him .</stage>Mr. Rixon .<stage>RIXON looks at him without recognising him .</stage>Don ’ t you remember me , sir ? I ’ m the junior partner in Andrews and Wright .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RIXON</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Of course I do . I saw your father on business the other day .</l>
      <stage>To CHARLES .</stage>
      <l>Where ’ s the telephone book ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ll just go and fetch it , sir . Mr. Halstane lent it to the gentleman upstairs .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RIXON</speaker>
     <p>Be as quick as you can .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>CHARLES goes out .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RIXON</speaker>
     <p><stage>To MR. WRIGHT .</stage>What are you doing here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MR. WRIGHT</speaker>
     <p>Well , the fact is , we ’ ve got a very large account with Halstane , and I ’ m told he ’ s in queer street . I want to get the money before the crash comes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RIXON</speaker>
     <p>Queer street ? The man ’ s just come into seven thousand a year .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MR. WRIGHT</speaker>
     <p>What !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RIXON</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s why I ’ m running all over the place to find him . You know he ’ s a relation of the Hollingtons . I was at her ladyship ’ s not half an hour ago — the Dowager , you know — my firm has acted for the whole family for the last hundred years . Well , I ’ d hardly arrived before a message came from the War Office to say that her grandson , the present lord , had been killed in India . So as soon as I could , I bolted round here . Mr. Halstane is the next heir , and he comes into seven thousand a year and the title .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MR. WRIGHT</speaker>
     <p>My gracious , that ’ s a piece of luck .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RIXON</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t mind telling you now that he ’ d pretty well come to the end of his tether . Your money was all right because he ’ d have paid everything up , but he wouldn ’ t have had much left .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MR. WRIGHT</speaker>
     <p>Of course he doesn ’ t know anything about this yet ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RIXON</speaker>
     <p>Not a word . For all he knows , he ’ s a ruined man , and here am I trying to get him on the telephone to tell him he ’ s come into a peerage and a very handsome income .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>CHARLES enters with the telephone book .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>7869 Gerrard , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RIXON</speaker>
     <p>Thanks .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He rings up and asks for the number .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RIXON</speaker>
     <p>7869 Gerrard , please , Miss .... What ? Confound it , the line ’ s engaged .... I must go round to his club in a cab . I suppose you don ’ t want to wait here now , Wright ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MR. WRIGHT</speaker>
     <p>No , sir . I ’ ll get back to the shop .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ope you ’ ll suit your own convenience , sir .<stage>CHARLES shows them out and comes back .</stage>I don ’ t know what these tradespeople are coming to when they expect gentlemen to pay their bills .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He seats himself in the most comfortable chair in the room and puts his feet on the table . His back is to the door . The newspaper is lying by his side . He shuts his eyes and dozes .</stage>
    <stage>GERALD enters silently , followed immediately by BLENKINSOP and FREDDIE PERKINS .</stage>
    <stage>GERALD is a handsome man of seven or eight and twenty , simple in his manners , carefully dressed but without exaggeration . FREDDIE is a vivacious boy of two and twenty , BLENKINSOP is an old bachelor of five and forty ; he is well-preserved and takes a good deal of care of his appearance . He is dressed in the height of fashion .</stage>
    <stage>For a moment they look silently at CHARLES , who wakes with a start and jumps up in confusion .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>I beg your pardon , sir ; I didn ’ t hear you come in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p><stage>With an ironical politeness which he preserves during all his remarks to CHARLES .</stage>Pray don ’ t let us disturb you . I shall never forgive myself if I think I ’ ve interrupted your nap .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>Shall I take your hat , sir ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s very kind of you . I shouldn ’ t like you to put yourself out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sitting down .</stage>By Jove , what a ripping chair ! No wonder that Charles went to sleep .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Rixon has just been , sir . He ’ s gone on to the club .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a laugh .</stage>I ’ m not sorry to miss him . One ’ s solicitor seldom has any good news to bring one .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>Will you have the whiskey and soda , sir ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>If it wouldn ’ t give you too much trouble .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>CHARLES goes out , and GERALD hands the cigarette box to BLENKINSOP and FREDDIE .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Sit down and make yourself comfortable , James .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>To do that is one of the few principles I ’ ve adhered to in the course of an easy and unadventurous life .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>CHARLES enters with a tray on which are glasses , whiskey and sodas .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>Is there anything else you want , sir ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>If you can spare me two minutes of your valuable time , I should like to make a few observations to you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Collect yourself , Charles , to receive the words of wisdom that fall from</l>
      <l>Mr. Halstane ’ s lips .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>Things is very bad on the Stock Exchange , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Charles , I have no objection to your sitting in my arm-chair and putting your feet on my table . I am willing to ignore the fact that you smoke my cigars and drink my whiskey .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sipping .</stage>You show excellent judgment , Charles . The whiskey ’ s capital .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Imperturbably .</stage>Pot-still , sir . Fifteen years in bottle .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I can even bear with equanimity that you should read my letters . For the most part they ’ re excessively tedious , and they will only show you how deplorable is the education of the upper classes . But I must insist on your not reading my paper till I ’ ve done with it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m very sorry , sir . I thought there was no objection .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>A newspaper , a suit of clothes , and a bottle of wine are three things at which I prefer ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>To ’ ave the first cut in , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I thank you , Charles ; I couldn ’ t have expressed my meaning more idiomatically .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laughing .</stage>You ’ d better have a drink .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>Allow me , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He mixes a whiskey and soda .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>You need not pour out the whiskey with such a generous hand as when you help yourself . Thank you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>Them mining shares of yours is very low , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>They are .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>If you ’ ll remember , sir , I was all against them at the time you bought .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>You are a jewel , Charles , if besides administering to your master ’ s wants you advise him in his financial transactions .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Unless I ’ m mistaken , Charles strongly recommended me to invest my money in public-houses .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>Them being frequented in peace and war , and not subject to clandestine removals . In peace men drink to celebrate their ’ appiness , and in war to drown their sorrow .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>You are a philosopher , Charles , and it cuts me to the quick that I should be forced to deny myself the charm of your conversation .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Astonished .</stage>I beg your pardon , sir ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I am endeavouring to give you notice in such a manner as not to outrage your susceptibilities .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>Me , sir ? I ’ m sorry if I don ’ t give satisfaction .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>On the contrary , you give every satisfaction . It has never been my good fortune to run across a servant who had an equal talent for blacking boots and for repartee . I am grateful for the care with which you have kept my wardrobe , and the encouragement you have offered to my attempts at humour . I have never seen you perturbed by a rebuke , or discouraged by ill-temper . Your merits , in fact , are overwhelming , but I ’ m afraid I must ask you to find another place .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>You really shouldn ’ t be so abrupt , Gerald . Look at him staggering under the blow .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m very comfortable here , sir . Can you give me no reason for this decision ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>You gave it yourself , Charles . As you justly observed , them mining shares is very low . You are sufficiently acquainted with my correspondence to be aware that my creditors have passed with singular unanimity from the stage of remonstrance to that of indignation .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>I say , I ’ m sorry to hear this , old man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>If it ’ s just a matter of wages , sir , I shall be ’ appy to wait till it suits your convenience to pay me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a smile of thanks .</stage>I ’ m grateful to you for that , Charles ; but , honestly , do you think half-measures can be of any use to me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>Well , sir , so far as I ’ m acquainted with your circumstances ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Come , come , this modesty ill becomes you . Is there a bill in this room , or a solicitor ’ s letter , with which you are not intimately acquainted ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>Well , sir , if you ask me outright — things is pretty bad .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I say , don ’ t play the ass any more . What the deuce does it all mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m sorry the manner in which I ’ m imparting to you an interesting piece of information , doesn ’ t meet with your approval . Would you like me to tear my hair in handfuls ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>It would be picturesque , but painful .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Are you really broke ?</p>

     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>So much so that I ’ ve to-day sublet my rooms . In a week , Charles , I shall cast the dust of London off my feet , a victim to the British custom of primogeniture .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Have you the least idea what I mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>No , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Well , I feel certain that during some of the many leisure moments you have enjoyed in my service , you have cast an eye upon that page in Burke upon which my name figures — insignificantly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>Begging your pardon , sir , I looked you up in the Peerage before I accepted the situation .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>It rejoices me to learn that your investigations were satisfactory .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>Well , sir , always having lived before with titled gentlemen , I felt I owed it to myself to be careful .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I am overpowered by your condescension , Charles . It never occurred to me that you were taking my character while I was taking yours .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>If servants wanted as good characters from masters as masters want from servants , I ’ ave an idea that many gentlemen would ’ ave to clean their own boots .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>You scintillate , Charles , but I deplore your tendency to digress .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>I beg pardon , sir . As you was the second son of an honourable and very well connected , I didn ’ t mind stretching a point . If I may say so , your father was almost a nobleman .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>The consequence is , however , that I was brought up without in the least knowing how to earn my living . I belong to that vast army of younger sons whose sole means of livelihood is a connection with a peer of the realm and such mother-wit as Dame Nature has provided them with .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>A ring is heard .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>There ’ s some one at the door , sir . Are you at home ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>No , I expect two ladies to tea in half an hour , but you must admit no one else . These gentlemen will be forced to deprive me of their society in twenty-five minutes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Not at all . Not at all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I repeat with considerable firmness that these gentlemen will be compelled by a previous engagement to leave me in twenty minutes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>It ’ ll be difficult after that to make our departure seem perfectly natural , won ’ t it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>A second ring is heard .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Nobody ’ s to come in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>Very good , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I say , old man , I ’ m awfully sorry to hear this bad news of yours . Can ’ t</l>
      <l>I do anything to help you ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>No , thanks .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The bell is rung continuously , with the greatest impatience .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>By Jove , whoever your visitor is , he doesn ’ t like being kept waiting .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p><stage>Outside .</stage>Is Mr. Halstane at home ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Softly .</stage>Why , it ’ s my aunt .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Mrs . Dot .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Ssh !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>Not at home , madam .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p><stage>Outside .</stage>Nonsense . I want to see him very particularly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m very sorry , madam . Mr. Halstane went out not five minutes ago . I almost wonder you didn ’ t meet him on the stairs .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I know all about that .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MRS. WORTHLEY comes in . She is a pretty little woman , very wonderfully gowned . She is frank , open and full of spirits . CHARLES follows her into the room .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Oh ! Three of you . Charles , how can you tell such stories ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Very gravely .</stage>Mr. Halstane is not at home , madam .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coming forward and taking her hand .</stage>Charles is shocked at your lack of decorum .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Run away , Charles . And don ’ t do it again .... I suppose you think this sort of thing isn ’ t done in the best families ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Stiffly .</stage>No , madam .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I saw one of my drays outside , so I thought I ’ d just look in to see how you liked it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Icily .</stage>I beg your pardon , madam ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>The beer , my good man , the beer ! Don ’ t you know that I ’ m Worthley ’ s</l>
      <l>Entire ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
     <p>I never gave the subject a thought , madam .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>And very good our half-crown family ale is , although I say it as shouldn ’ t .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>You may go , Charles .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Without a word , much on his dignity CHARLES departs .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gaily .</stage>It ’ s fortunate I ’ ve just given him notice , because Charles would certainly never stay in a house where he ’ d been so grossly insulted .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I love shocking Charles . He ’ s so genteel . Whenever I come here I see him obviously trying not to show that he ’ s perfectly well aware that I have anything to do with trade .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>The world is so degenerate that it ’ s only among domestic servants that you find any respect for landed gentry and any contempt for commerce .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p><stage>To FREDDIE .</stage>I ’ m glad to see that you ’ re not ruining your health by working too hard as my secretary .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve been lunching with Blenkinsop . I answered about fifty begging letters before I came out this morning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p><stage>To GERALD .</stage>You ’ ve not said you ’ re glad to see me yet .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m not sure that I am , very .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p><stage>Not at all disconcerted .</stage>Then say you like my frock .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Yes , it ’ s very nice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Very nice ! I should think it was very nice . There ’ s no one in London who ’ d venture to wear anything half so outrageous . And as for the hat ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>The hat ’ s hideous . But I suppose it ’ s fashionable .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>My dear James , where were you educated ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>At Eton .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Well , they taught you nothing about clothes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>I wish sometimes that nice women wouldn ’ t get themselves up as if they were no better than they should be .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t be so absurd . The ideal of a woman who takes any pains about her frocks is to look as like an abandoned hussy as she possibly can .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MRS . DOT chooses the most comfortable chair in the room .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m afraid I can ’ t ask you to sit down .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Oh , don ’ t trouble . I ’ m perfectly capable of doing that of my own accord .... If you think I ’ m going before you ’ ve answered a hundred and fifty questions you ’ re very much mistaken . First , I want to know why you ’ ve not been near me for the last week ? Then why you try to keep me out of the place ? And lastly , why you show every desire to get rid of me when I ’ m here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve not seen you because I ’ ve been uncommonly busy . I said I was not at home because I ’ m in the worst possible temper . And I want to get rid of you because I ’ m expecting somebody else .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I suppose if I were a thoroughly tactful person I should now ring for my carriage ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I daresay you would ask me to ring for it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Well , I shall neither do the one nor the other . In the first place your answers are all nonsense and in the second I want to know who ’ s coming ? If it ’ s some one I know , I shall stop and say , How d ’ you do , and if it isn ’ t I want to see what it ’ s like .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I suppose you know I ’ m perfectly capable of turning you out by main force .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>If you touch me I shall scream .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She looks quickly at FREDDIE and BLENKINSOP , then gives a smile .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Freddie , I quite forgot . I ’ ve got a pile of letters that I found on my way out this afternoon . There are three poor clergymen who can ’ t pay their bills , and there are five elderly spinsters who don ’ t know which way to turn for their quarter ’ s rent , and there are seven deserving ladies with a starving husband each and sixteen children .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>How very immoral !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>It would be much more immoral if they had a starving child each and sixteen husbands .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>I suppose it ’ s never occurred to you that you do a great deal more harm than good by your indiscriminate charity ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t be such an old frump . If it gives me a certain amount of pleasure to give money away , why on earth shouldn ’ t I ? I daresay that nineteen out of every twenty people I help are thoroughly worthless , but it ’ s only by doing something for them all that I can be quite certain of not missing the twentieth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>D ’ you want me to write to them at once ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>This very minute .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a smile .</stage>But that ’ ll only get rid of me , you know . Blenkinsop will still be here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coolly .</stage>James , do go and see that Freddie writes his letters nicely . He ’ s only just come down from Oxford , and his spelling is rather shaky .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a grunt .</stage>You can give us a shout when you ’ ve had your talk .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Now mind , Freddie . I before E except after C .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They go out .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laughing .</stage>You ’ re a very bold woman , Mrs . Dot .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a change of tone .</stage>What ’ s the matter , Gerald ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Surprised .</stage>With me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Won ’ t you tell an old friend ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p><stage>After a very short pause .</stage>Nothing that you can help me in , Mrs . Dot .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Won ’ t you leave the Mrs. out ? It makes me feel so five and thirtyish .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>You ’ re a ripping good sort , and we ’ ve had some charming times together . I ’ m glad that you came to-day , because it ’ s given me an opportunity to thank you for all your kindness to me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>My dear boy , what are you talking about ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Well , the fact is , I ’ ve been spending a good deal of money lately , and</l>
      <l>I ’ m rather broke .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>How stupid of me ! I ’ ve always had such lots myself it never occurs to me that any one else may be hard up . And I ’ ve let you pay all sorts of things for me , theatres and dinners and heaven knows what . I must owe you a perfect fortune .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Nonsense ! You don ’ t owe me a penny .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Well then , in future I insist on paying for everything . I ’ m not going to give up our little dinners at the Savoy and our suppers and all the rest of it . Don ’ t be so silly . You know I have ten times more money than I know what to do with .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I can see you furtively slipping your purse into my hand so that I should pay for a luncheon , and giving me a shilling over for the cab . No , thank you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Then we ’ ll economise together . It only means going to the pit of a theatre instead of taking a box . Well , I like the pit much better . You see all the women come in and you criticise their back hair . And you suck delicious oranges all the time . It makes my mouth water to think of it . And we ’ ll go on a bus instead of taking cabs . They ’ re much safer , and I like sitting on the front seat and talking to the driver . Bus-drivers are always such handsome men .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s not a question of driving in buses , but of walking on my flat feet .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Very well . You shall walk on your flat feet , and I ’ ll trip along by your side on my arched instep .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Things have come to such a pass that I must either beg , steal , or work .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Then tell me exactly how matters stand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>It would only bore you , and besides you wouldn ’ t understand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Now you ’ re talking through your hat , my friend . You ’ re simply talking through your hat . I flatter myself there are few men who have a better head for business than I have . Why , since my husband died I ’ ve almost doubled our profits . The brewery has never been so flourishing . I ’ ve told the British People on fifty thousand hoardings to drink Worthley ’ s Half-crown Family Ale , and by Jove , the British People do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>You funny little thing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Well , now tell me all about it , and let ’ s see if things can ’ t be put straight .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Oh , my dear , I ’ m afraid they ’ re in a most awful mess . I never had much money to start with , and I got into debt . Then I tried a flutter on the Stock Exchange , and the confounded shares went down steadily from the day I bought .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s a way shares have when fools buy them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>But I daresay I could have weathered that , only a pal of mine got into a hole , and I backed a bill for him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>You don ’ t mean to say you did that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I was obliged to . I couldn ’ t let him go under without trying to do something .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>You donkey , you perfect donkey !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>He swore he ’ d be able to pay the money .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I never knew a man yet , or a woman either for that matter , who ’ d stick at a thundering lie when he wanted money . And what ’ s the result ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Well , the result is that after I ’ ve paid everything up , I shall have about five hundred pounds left . I ’ m proposing to go out to America and rough it a bit .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Pardon my asking , but do you think a handsome face , a talent for small talk , and a certain charm of manner will enable you to earn your daily bread ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laughing .</stage>I don ’ t want to seem vain , but although I ’ ve done my best to conceal them , I fancy I have two or three other qualifications which will be of more service .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Then the long and the short of it is that you ’ re ruined .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Absolutely .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m delighted to hear it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Dot !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I am . I can ’ t help it . But I think your plan of going to the States is simply foolish .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>What else can I do ? The Cape ’ s entirely played out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>You stupid creature .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I beg your pardon !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>You belong to a class whose chief resource when it has squandered its money is a rich marriage . The custom is so well recognised that when a man of good family emigrates rather than have recourse to it , society is outraged and suspicious .</p>

     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Thanks . I don ’ t think I can see myself marrying for money .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t be so absurd . I never heard that the course of true love ran any less smoothly because a charming widow had sixty thousand a year .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>What do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>My dear boy , I ’ m not a perfect fool . A man thinks a woman never sees anything unless she looks at it with both eyes at once wide open . Don ’ t you know that she can see things through the back of her head with a stone wall in between ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>What have you seen , then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve seen a thousand things . I ’ ve seen your eyes light up when I came into the room , I ’ ve seen you watch me when you thought I wasn ’ t looking . I ’ ve seen you scowl at any young fool who paid me an outrageous compliment . I ’ ve seen the pleasure it gave you to do me any trifling service . I ’ ve seen you watch for the opportunity of putting my cloak on my shoulders after the play . And — I ’ m sorry — but I ’ ve come to the conclusion that you ’ re in love with me . I dare say the fact has escaped your notice , but that ’ s only because men are so deplorably stupid .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gravely .</stage>D ’ you think it ’ s quite kind to laugh at me now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>But I ’ m not laughing at you , my dear . I ’ m so pleased , and so flattered and so touched . At first I thought I was only a fool , and that I saw those things only because I wanted to . And when your hand trembled a little as it took mine , I was afraid it was only my hand that was trembling . And at last when I was certain that you were just as much in love with me as I was with you , I was so glad that I cried for two hours . And I had to use a whole box of powder before I could make myself presentable again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Grimly .</stage>I ’ m afraid you ’ ll think me an utter brute . I ought to have told you long ago that I ’ m engaged to be married .</p>

     <p>Gerald !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve been engaged to Nellie Sellenger for the last three years .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Why didn ’ t you tell me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>No one was supposed to know anything about it . And — I was afraid of losing you . Oh , Dot , Dot , I love you with all my heart . And I ’ m so glad to be forced to tell you at last .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>But I don ’ t understand in the least .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>You know Nellie Sellenger is an old friend of mine .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Yes , it was at the Sellengers ’ I first met you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Well , three years ago we were staying at the same place in the country , and I was a young fool .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>You mean that there was no other girl there , and so you flirted with her . But you need not have asked her to marry you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Apologetically .</stage>It was the merest accident . It came to pieces in my ’ ands , so to speak .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Really ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>We were taking a walk in the garden after dinner , and a perfectly absurd moon was shining . It seemed the obvious thing to do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>And of course she accepted . The girl of eighteen always does .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>But Lady Sellenger refused to hear of it . She thought me most ineligible .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Lady Sellenger ’ s a sensible woman . She was quite right .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m not so sure . If she ’ d given us her blessing and told us to do as we liked , we should probably have broken it off in three weeks . But she was really rather offensive about it . She refused to let Nellie see me , and the result was that we were always running across one another in Bond Street tea-shops .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Monstrous ! And so bad for the digestion .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Some time ago Lady Sellenger found out that we were writing to one another and so on , so she came to see me and said she ’ d made up her mind to take Nellie abroad for a year . She made me promise to hold no communication with her during that time , and agreed that if we were still of the same mind when they came back , she would withdraw the opposition and let us be properly engaged .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>An announcement in the Morning Post and all that sort of thing ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I suppose so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>And when are they coming back ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>They came back last week . But I haven ’ t had a chance of speaking to</l>
      <l>Nellie yet . The year is up to-day , and this morning I had a note from</l>
      <l>Lady Sellenger asking if they might come to tea .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>And what are you going to say to her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Good heavens ! What can I say ? I was poor enough a year ago , but now I ’ m penniless . I ’ m bound to ask for my release .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Then why on earth have you been trying to make me utterly miserable ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>You know , I don ’ t want to seem an awful prig , but I don ’ t think I should much like doing anything shabby . If Nellie wants me to keep my promise I shan ’ t draw back .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Oh , but she won ’ t . She ’ ll be only too glad to get rid of you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m afraid there ’ s something else I must tell you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>More ? Don ’ t say you ’ ve got a horrible past , because I shan ’ t turn a hair .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>No , it ’ s not that . You know that Lord Hollington is a relation of mine .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Only a fifteenth cousin , isn ’ t he ? Far too distant to brag about .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>A year ago three lives stood between me and the peerage . It seemed impossible that I could ever come into anything .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>But last winter my cousin George unfortunately broke his neck in the hunting-field , and his poor old father died of the shock . If anything happened to my cousin Charles everything would come to me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>And Lady Sellenger would doubtless withdraw her opposition to your marriage .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>She ’ s a very nice woman , but she has rather a keen eye for the main chance .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Even her best friend would hesitate to call her disinterested . But why should anything happen to Lord Hollington ? He ’ s quite young , isn ’ t he ? I saw his engagement announced in the Morning Post a little while ago .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>He ’ s out in India at this moment . He ’ s a soldier , you know . It appears there ’ s some trouble on the North-West Frontier , and he ’ s in command of the expedition .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Oh , but nothing is going to happen to him . He ’ ll live till he ’ s eighty .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m sure I hope he will .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Say again that you love me , Gerald .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>I oughtn ’ t to yet .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>You know , you ’ ve got to marry me . I insist upon it . After all , you ’ ve been trifling with my affections shamefully . Oh , we shall be so happy , Gerald . And we ’ ll never grow any older than we are now . You know , I ’ m an awfully good sort , really . I talk a lot of nonsense , but I don ’ t mean it . I very seldom listen to it myself . I ’ m sick of society . I want to settle down and be domesticated . I ’ ll sit at home and darn your socks . And I shall hate it , and I shall be so happy . And if you want to be independent you can have a job at the brewery . We want a smart energetic man to keep us up to the times . And we ’ ll have a lovely box at the opera , and you can always get away for the shooting .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>A ring is heard .</stage>

     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>There they are .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t want to disturb you , but if you ’ ve quite finished your conversation perhaps you ’ d like to come and have tea .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>BLENKINSOP and FREDDIE come in and go to the fire .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>I observe with interest that your remark is facetious .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>I ’ m simply freezing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>You didn ’ t mind being shut up in there , did you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Not at all . I rather like sitting in an arctic room without a fire , with a window looking on a blank wall , and the society of your nephew and the Sporting Times of the week before last as my only means of entertainment .</p>

    <stage>CHARLES enters to announce the SELLENGERS . He goes out and brings in the tea .</stage>

     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>Of course . But I don ’ t approve of him .</p>

     <p>Why not ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>

     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>And how did you like Italy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>A grossly over-rated place . So many marriageable daughters and so few eligible men .</p>

     <p>How d ’ you do ?</p>

     <p>Dear Mrs. Worthley , what a charming gown ! You always wear such — striking things .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>It advertises the beer , don ’ t you know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>I wish I could drink it , Mrs. Worthley , but it ’ s so fattening . I understand you always have it on your table .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I think that ’ s the least I can do , as it ’ s only on account of the beer that I can have a table at all .</p>

    <stage>GERALD comes over to LADY SELLENGER with a cup . She takes it . The others are gathered round the tea-table , which is right at the back , and talk among themselves .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>Come and sit by me , Gerald . I ’ ve not had a word with you since we came back from Italy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Lightly .</stage>What are you going to say to me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>You can guess why I wrote to ask if we might come and see you to-day ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rising .</stage>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>Now do sit down . And look as if you were talking of the weather .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s a little difficult to discuss the matter quite indifferently .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>My dear boy , it ’ s the little difficulties of life which prevent it from being dull . We should be no better than the beasts of the field if we had no anxieties about our soul and our position in society .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I see .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rather impatiently .</stage>My dear Gerald , why don ’ t you help me ? What I have to say is so very unpleasant . You know I have always had a most sincere affection for you . Under other circumstances I would have wanted no better son-in-law .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s very kind of you to say so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve assured you for the last three years that a marriage was absurd , and now I want to tell you that it ’ s impossible . Love is all very well in its way , but it doesn ’ t make up for a shabby house in the suburbs .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>You ’ re not romantic , Lady Sellenger .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>My dear , when you reach my age you ’ ll agree with me that it ’ s only the matter of fact which really signifies . Love in a cottage is a delusion of youth . It ’ s difficult enough after ten years of solid matrimony in Grosvenor Square .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>You married for love , Lady Sellenger .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m anxious that my daughter shouldn ’ t make the same mistake . Now let us be quite frank with one another .... Are you sure they ’ re not listening ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Glancing at the others .</stage>They seem very much occupied with their own affairs . What is your ultimatum ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>Well , Gerald , I ’ m not in the least mercenary . I know that money can ’ t give happiness . But I do feel that unless you have at least two thousand a year you can ’ t make my daughter even comfortable .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m sure that ’ s very modest .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s not love in a cottage . It ’ s not love in a palace . It ’ s just — matrimony in Onslow Gardens .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I may as well tell you at once that I ’ ve had very bad luck . I wanted to make money , and I ’ ve come an absolute cropper .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>My dear Gerald , I ’ m very sorry . Is it as bad as all that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>It couldn ’ t be much worse .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>Dear me , that ’ s very sad . But , of course , it simplifies matters , doesn ’ t it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Enormously . It puts marriage entirely out of the question and leaves only one course open to me . I ’ ll take the earliest opportunity to ask Nellie for my release .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>What a pity it is you ’ re so poor ! Your principles are really excellent .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>But what about Nellie ? How will she take it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>She ’ s so reserved , poor dear ! She never speaks of her feelings . But after three London seasons most girls have learnt to bow to the inevitable . And how is Lord Hollington ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>He ’ s to be married as soon as he comes back from India .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>It was dreadfully sad that his uncle and his cousin should die within a year . If anything happened to him you ’ d be in very different circumstances . But , of course , it would be wicked to wish it . I hope you never do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Never . I trust he ’ ll live to a hundred .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>And I daresay he ’ ll have fifteen children . Those delicate men often do .... Why don ’ t you speak to Nellie now and get it over ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>This very minute ? With others in the room ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s just it , I want to give neither of you any opportunity for sentiment .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>You ’ re certainly very practical .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>No woman can afford to be sentimental when she has a marriageable daughter .... For heaven ’ s sake don ’ t make Nellie cry , we ’ re dining out to-night .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ll do my best to be very matter of fact .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Raising her voice .</stage>Mr. Blenkinsop , I want to quarrel with you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m so sorry , I didn ’ t see you . I ’ d just been to the War Office to inquire if there was any news of those fellows out in India . By the way , Halstane , isn ’ t Hollington a relation of yours ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>But what is it , Mr. Blenkinsop ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>A small force was sent out to punish some local people up in the hills , who ’ d been making themselves troublesome , and it hasn ’ t been heard of since . The idea is that there may have been some trouble and they ’ ve all got cut up .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>But how does it concern Lord Hollington ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>He was in command of it .</p>

     <p>Good God !</p>

     <p>When I was there a couple of hours ago the War Office had no news at all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>But why didn ’ t you tell me about it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>I thought you knew . I ’ d forgotten for the moment that Hollington had anything to do with you . He ’ s a very distant relation , isn ’ t he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I hardly know him .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>I can quite understand you ’ re a little upset , but after all he was only a very distant relation of yours .</p>

     <p>The news has come just an hour too soon . It ’ s bound me hand and foot .</p>

     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>What d ’ you mean by that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Nellie accepted me when I was poor and of no account . Now that I ’ m well off I can ’ t go to her and say : I ’ ve changed my mind and don ’ t want to marry you .</p>

     <p>What d ’ you mean by being well off ?</p>

     <p>I believe I shall have six or seven thousand a year .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>How ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>A girl who loved you wouldn ’ t have a skirt cut like that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I can ’ t draw back now , Dot . You must see that I can ’ t .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>If you cared for me , you ’ d easily find some way out of the difficulty .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I must be honest , Dot .... I don ’ t want to seem a snob , but I ’ ve got an ancient name , and it ’ s rather honourable . I ’ m by way of being the head of the family now . I don ’ t want to begin by acting like a cad .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>You know , I ’ m much nicer than Nellie . I ’ m more amusing , and I ’ m better dressed , and I ’ ve got five motor cars . It ’ s true she ’ s younger than I am , but I don ’ t feel a day more than seventeen .<stage>With a little look at him .</stage>And if you had any sense of decency at all you ’ d say I looked it . You said you loved me just now . Say it again , Gerald . It ’ s so good to hear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t see how we can help ourselves .</p>

     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p><stage>Beginning to lose her temper .</stage>I suppose you just want to finish an awkward scene ? I don ’ t want to harrow you . Why don ’ t you go to the War Office ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>You must see it ’ s not my fault . If we must part , let us part friends .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Now , I declare he wants to sentimentalise . Isn ’ t it enough that you ’ ve made me frightfully unhappy ? D ’ you want me to say it doesn ’ t matter at all , as if you ’ d spilt a cup of tea on me ? D ’ you think I like being utterly wretched ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>For heaven ’ s sake , don ’ t talk like that . You ’ re tearing my heart to pieces .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Your heart ? I should like to bang it on the floor and stamp on it . You must expect to suffer a little . You can ’ t put it all on me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>

     <p>I ’ m in a temper .</p>

     <p>That must be obvious to the meanest intelligence .</p>

    <stage>She crumples up the paper and stamps on it .</stage>

     <p>You can ’ t deny that it ’ s rather annoying to take up your paper in the morning and discover an official announcement that the man you ’ ve made up your mind to marry is taking serious steps to marry somebody else .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNT ELIZA</speaker>

     <p>Because I am . That ’ s the most conclusive reason possible . And I ’ ve set my heart on marrying him . And the more obstacles there are the more I mean to marry him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNT ELIZA</speaker>
     <p>I can ’ t imagine why you hadn ’ t the sense to fall in love with one of the various eligible persons who want to marry you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>But he does want to marry me . He ’ s desperately in love with me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNT ELIZA</speaker>
     <p>I should have thought he could find a better way of showing it than by getting engaged to somebody else .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>He ’ s a sentimentalist , like all his sex . Good heavens , what a mess the world would get into if it weren ’ t for the practical common sense of the average women .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNT ELIZA</speaker>
     <p>And what do you propose to do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s just it . I don ’ t in the least know . They ’ ll all be here in half an hour , and I haven ’ t the shadow of a scheme . I lie awake all night racking my brains , and I can ’ t think of anything .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNT ELIZA</speaker>
     <p>Why did you ask them to come here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I thought I might hit upon something if they were under my eyes . Gerald had promised to spend Whitsun with me and , so that he shouldn ’ t put me off , I asked the Sellengers , too . Lady Sellenger was only too glad to get a week ’ s board and lodging for nothing .<stage>The sound is heard of a motor stopping .</stage>There ’ s Jimmie Blenkinsop . I told you he was going to motor down in time for luncheon , didn ’ t I ?<stage>BLENKINSOP comes in with FREDDIE . FREDDIE has on a gay tweed suit .</stage>Jimmie !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>How d ’ you do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He shakes hands with MRS . DOT and AUNT ELIZA .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Now we ’ ll have luncheon . You must be starving with hunger .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>You must let me wash first .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>No , we ’ re all far too hungry . Freddie will go and wash his hands for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She rings half a dozen times quickly on a little bell on the table .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I shall be back in one minute .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Now sit down . I ’ m perfectly ravenous .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>THE BUTLER and the FOOTMAN bring in luncheon , which is eaten during the next scene .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNT ELIZA</speaker>
     <p>I perceive that the tender passion hasn ’ t in the least interfered with your appetite .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Oh , my dear James , I ’ m so unhappy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>You look it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>By the way , how do I look ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>All right . You ’ ve changed your cook .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Hang my cook .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>I wouldn ’ t if I were you . She ’ s very good .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Of course you ’ ll drink the family ale ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Of course I ’ ll do nothing of the kind .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>You know it ’ s one of my principles to have it on the table .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Yes , but it ’ s one of my principles not to drink it . I seem to remember that you have some particularly fine hock .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Jimmie , have you never been in love ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Never , thank God .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t believe it . Every one ’ s in love . I ’ m in love .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Not with me , I trust .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>You perfect idiot .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Not at all . I should think it very natural .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I wonder why you never married , James .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Because I have a considerable gift for repartee . I discovered in my early youth that men propose not because they want to marry , but because on certain occasions they are entirely at a loss for topics of conversation .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNT ELIZA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>It was a momentous discovery .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>No sooner had I made it than I began to cultivate my power of small talk . I felt that my only chance was to be ready with appropriate subjects at the shortest notice , and I spent a considerable part of my last year at Oxford in studying the best masters .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I never noticed that you were particularly brilliant .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>I never played for brilliancy . I played for safety . I flatter myself that when prattle was needed I have never been found wanting . I have met the ingenuity of sweet seventeen with a few observations on Free Trade , while the haggard efforts of thirty have struggled in vain against a brief exposition of the higher philosophy . The skittish widow of uncertain age has retired in disorder before a complete acquaintance with the restoration dramatists , and I have routed the serious spinster with religious leanings by my remarkable knowledge of the results of missionary endeavour in Central Africa . Once a dowager sought to ask me my intentions , but I flung at her astonished head an entire article from the “ Encyclopædia Britannica .” These are only my serious efforts . I need not tell you how often I have evaded a flash of the eyes by an epigram or ignored a sigh by an apt quotation from the poets .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t believe a word you say . I believe you never married for the simple reason that nobody would have you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Do me the justice to acknowledge that I ’ m the only man who ’ s known you ten days without being tempted by your preposterous income to offer you his hand and heart .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t believe my income has anything to do with it . I put it down entirely to my very considerable personal attractions .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNT ELIZA</speaker>
     <p>Here is Freddie , at last . What has he been doing ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>FREDDIE comes in , having changed into flannels .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Why on earth have you changed your clothes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sitting down at table .</stage>I regard it as part of my duties as your secretary to look nice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t know that I think it essential for you to put on seven different suits a day .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I thought Miss Sellenger would probably like to go on the river before tea .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNT ELIZA</speaker>
     <p>If she does , it ’ s more likely to be with Lord Hollington than with you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , that ’ s rot . Gerald ’ s an awfully good sort , but he ’ s not the sort of chap a girl ’ s desperately fond of .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>You think that , do you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Well , you can ’ t see yourself falling in love with him can you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>No . No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNT ELIZA</speaker>
     <p>And what is the sort of man a girl ’ s desperately fond of ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I don ’ t know .<stage>Taking up a spoon and looking at himself , twisting an infinitesimal moustache .</stage>I should think some one a bit younger than Gerald .</p>

     <p><stage>To AUNT ELIZA pointing with a scornful finger at FREDDIE .</stage>Do you think any one could possibly fall in love with that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNT ELIZA</speaker>
     <p>Of course not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>

    </sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking at him doubtfully .</stage>Well , if you ask me point blank I don ’ t think I should .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>You ’ re all of you jolly supercilious .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>He ’ s not positively plain , is he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Not positively .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Look here , you shut up . I bet I could cut you out with any girl you like to mention .</p>

     <p>Rubbish !</p>

     <p>I daresay he can whisper nonsense in a woman ’ s ear as well as any one else .</p>

     <p>It ’ s born in them , the brutes .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Well , I flatter myself Miss Sellenger will be much more pleased to see me than to see anybody else down here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>You ’ ve only seen her once .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>She ’ s a jolly nice girl , I can tell you that .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Ironically .</stage>I suppose she squeezed your hand when you went away ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Well , it so happens , she did .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>You needn ’ t be set up about it , because she squeezed mine , too . It ’ s evidently a habit .</p>

     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>

     <p>It ’ s no good , you know . You ’ re my aunt , and the prayer book wouldn ’ t let you marry me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Which means that you ’ ve found him a wife , and you ’ re going to marry him to some one whether he likes it or not .</p>

     <p>Twenty-two . Why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>The delightful age when it ’ s still possible to feel desperately wicked . But you are old enough to have learnt that the moods of women are inscrutable .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , rot ! I never met a woman whom I couldn ’ t read at a glance .</p>

     <p><stage>Ironically .</stage>Really ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>You know , they talk about the incomprehensibility of women , but it ’ s all humbug .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

    </sp>
    <stage>MRS . DOT and AUNT ELIZA come in with LADY SELLENGER , NELLIE and HOLLINGTON . They are all talking .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>We had a delightful journey . Oh , how beautiful your garden is ! So romantic . I love romance .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>When it ’ s backed by an adequate income .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>How d ’ you do ? You cynic .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m nothing of the sort . But I occasionally tell the truth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>You ’ re the most cynical man in London , and I ’ m frightened to death of you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>There ’ s nothing the world loves more than a ready-made description which they can hang on to a man , and so save themselves all trouble in future . When I was quite young it occurred to some one that I was a cynic , and since then I ’ ve never been able to remark that it was a fine day without being accused of odious cynicism .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>My dear Mr. Blenkinsop , what every one says is always true . That is one of the foundations of society .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>I gained my reputation by remarking once that it was possible for a penniless young man who married a very rich woman old enough to be his mother to be genuinely in love with her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>I think it was a very cynical observation .</p>

     <p>You can ’ t expect me to be so uncivil as to say no .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>But I ’ m perfectly serious .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Are you , by Jove ? That alters the matter . In that case the answer is in the negative .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>And is there the least chance of your falling in love with me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Not so long as I remain in full possession of my senses .</p>

     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Do you want to marry me ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Really you embarrass me very much .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t hedge .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s a little disconcerting to have a pistol put to your head in the form of a proposal of marriage .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m not making you a proposal of marriage , idiot .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Then I should very much like to know what you are doing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m asking you a very simple and ordinary question .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Thank God , it ’ s not one that women ask often .</p>

     <p>My dear friend , this is very surprising .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>There are people who ’ d welcome the proposal with alacrity .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>For how long ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Only for a week .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>You ’ re sure it ’ s not in earnest ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>Quite sure .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>And what have I got to do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Well , you ’ ve got to look as if you liked it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sombrely .</stage>Of course , it sounds very delightful .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>You must show a coming-on disposition , you know , or I can do nothing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Do you want me to make love to you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m afraid it ’ s asking a great deal of you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Not at all . Not at all . But I wish you ’ d tell me what your little game is .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Ah , here ’ s Aunt Eliza . The very person I wanted .<stage>AUNT ELIZA comes on the terrace from the house . Impulsively .</stage>Aunt Eliza , will you be a perfect brick ? Will you do something for me , that ’ s an awful nuisance ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNT ELIZA</speaker>
     <p>My dear , why on earth are you so excited ? Of course I ’ ll do anything in reason for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>But it ’ s not in reason .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNT ELIZA</speaker>
     <p>Well , I ’ ll do it all the same .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I want you to take a motor and bolt up to London and get a special licence .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNT ELIZA</speaker>
     <p>A special licence !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>A special licence !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p><stage>Catching sight of his face .</stage>Get two special licences . They ’ re always useful things to have in a house .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNT ELIZA</speaker>
     <p>But they must be made out to certain names .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Must they ? How stupid ! Well , have one made out for Frederick Perkins and</l>
      <l>Eleanor Sellenger .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNT ELIZA</speaker>
     <p>My dear child , you must be crazy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Now don ’ t argue , but do as I tell you . If two young things are thrown together with a certain amount of skill they always marry .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNT ELIZA</speaker>
     <p>But they hardly know one another .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>If people waited to know one another before they married , the world wouldn ’ t be so grossly over-populated as it is now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNT ELIZA</speaker>
     <p>You ’ re certainly quite crazy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>No , I ’ m not . I shall never get Gerald to break his word . My only chance is with Nellie .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Uneasily .</stage>But you ’ ve told her to get two licences .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Make the second one out in the names of James Blenkinsop and Frances</l>
      <l>Annandale Worthley .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>I absolutely refuse .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>But you must let me . You can ’ t leave an old friend in the lurch .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s all very fine to invoke the claims of friendship , but it ’ s carrying it rather far when you pay three guineas for a special licence .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>My dear man , I can ’ t drag you to the altar .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m beginning to think you ’ re capable of anything .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>But don ’ t you see , you idiot , that I want to marry Gerald Hollington ? And I ’ m eating my heart out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Crossly .</stage>It ’ s evidently a diet that agrees with you . You ’ re growing fat on it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t be spiteful . I ’ ve not gained half a pound in the last five years .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNT ELIZA</speaker>
     <p>And how on earth are you going to get Freddie and Nellie Sellenger to use this licence ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Never mind , leave everything to me . And make haste to get up to London .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNT ELIZA</speaker>
     <p>Very well , I ’ ll go at once .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Just as AUNT ELIZA is going into the house LADY SELLENGER comes out , followed by NELLIE ; AUNT ELIZA stops and listens to the conversation from the doorway .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I hope you ’ ve found everything you wanted .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>Oh , yes , thanks . I ’ m quite delighted with the view from my room .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Come and sit down . I have something very serious I want to talk to you about .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>Dear Mr. Blenkinsop , do take Nellie for a little stroll in the garden .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Oh , but it concerns Nellie , and I want her to hear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>I perceive you are inclined to think that the serious cannot fail to be improper , Lady Sellenger .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>Be quiet , you horrible cynic .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Well , a most ridiculous thing has happened , and I want Nellie to help me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>Me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>My dear , it ’ s so unfortunate , but my nephew has fallen head over ears in love with you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>Nonsense !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I can ’ t understand it . After all , he ’ s only seen you once , and you can ’ t have exchanged more than a dozen words .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>How very annoying !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>And it ’ s so unexpected , because he ’ s not at all the sort of boy who falls in and out of love with every pretty girl he meets . I think you ’ re his first passion , and he ’ s inclined to take it very seriously .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>Poor boy , I can afford to sympathise with him now that Nellie is safely engaged to Gerald Hollington .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s really rather flattering , isn ’ t it ? But how on earth d ’ you know ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>He tells me everything . You see I ’ ve always tried to be his friend as well as his aunt . He has no secrets from me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>You ’ ll tell us next that a boy who ’ s been to Eton and Oxford has a pure and innocent mind .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>My dear child , he simply raves about you . He ’ s been talking of nothing else ever since you met .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>But doesn ’ t he know that Nellie is going to be married at the end of the season ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Of course , he does . I ’ ve dinned it into his ears , but it seems to have no effect on him . He ’ s the sort of lover that will hear of no obstacles . It ’ s really quite pathetic to hear the passionate harangues that he pours into my ears .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>What sort of things does he say ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>My dear , I suppose very much the same as Gerald .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>No one could accuse Gerald of being a passionate lover .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Really ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m very glad he ’ s not . He ’ s going to be your husband , and that ’ s more satisfactory than any amount of pretty speeches .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>I could wish that he talked to me of something besides the weather and the Royal Academy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>My dear child , what are you saying ? Gerald has a charming nature and the very highest principles .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Imitating her pompous manner .</stage>To say nothing of a peerage and a considerable income .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>He certainly has every advantage over poor Freddie , who is nobody in particular and hasn ’ t a penny to bless himself with .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>I think he ’ s awfully nice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Well , that ’ s just what I don ’ t want you to think . I shouldn ’ t have said anything to you about his — mad infatuation , only I want you to be very careful .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>Of course . It ’ s quite natural .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>What do you want me to do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Well , I want you to be very good and sweet and help me to cure him . I ’ d send him away , only it would have no effect . I thought if he saw you again he might find out that you have at least one or two faults . At present he thinks you too perfect for words .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m not that , really .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I didn ’ t think you were . I want you to promise that you ’ ll do nothing that he can in the least take as encouragement . I want you to be very distant and very cold .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>Of course , I ’ ll be only too glad to do anything I can .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>You ’ d be doing him a real kindness if you could snub him at every opportunity . Then you must avoid him as much as you can . Of course , you ’ ll be very much with Gerald while you ’ re down here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>Of course . The dears , they ’ ve not seen one another for a year , and they have an infinity of things to discuss .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>It ’ ll be quite easy for you to show my poor Freddie that he ’ s only making a prodigious fool of himself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>I feel so sorry for him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>You will do what you can , won ’ t you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ll make it quite plain to him at once that he mustn ’ t care for me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Treat it as an impertinence that you resent .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ll do that on the first opportunity .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I know you have the sweetest nature in the world , but if you could be really brutal to him at once , it would cure him instantly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>I can be horrid when I like .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m sure you can . I put infinite reliance in your tact .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>And now I think we really might take a little turn in the garden before tea .<stage>Seeing that NELLIE , instead of accompanying her , strolls towards the house .</stage>Where are you going , Nellie ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>

    </sp>
    <stage>She goes away . Just as NELLIE is entering the house FREDDIE comes out . She gives him a glance and as she passes , drops a rose . FREDDIE picks it up and comes forward .</stage>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I shall do nothing of the sort . I shall put it in my button-hole .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Freddie , I ’ ve come to the conclusion that you want a holiday . I wish you to pack up your things at once and go to Brighton for a week . You ’ re looking pale and tired . I ’ m sure you ’ ve been working too hard .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t you agree with me , James ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Certainly . I think a change of air is distinctly indicated .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>But I can ’ t go away when you ’ ve got people in the house . Besides , who ’ s to look after your correspondence ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>My dear boy , your health is the chief thing . I should never forgive myself if you came to any harm while you were my secretary . I ’ ll write my letters myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Besides , I shall be here , and I ’ ll do all I can to help you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t believe I ’ m pale .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>You only have to look at yourself .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She takes out a little pocket mirror and hands it to him .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Let ’ s look at your tongue .<stage>He puts it out .</stage>Tut , tut , tut .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Look here , there ’ s something behind this .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>You ’ re too clever , my boy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I see through your little game . Aunt Dot , you want to get rid of me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>How can you be so absurd ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Now , I wonder what your reason is .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Shall we tell him the truth ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Yes , perhaps you ’ d better . He ’ s a very bright boy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Well , the fact is , Freddie , a dreadful thing has happened . Poor Nellie</l>
      <l>Sellenger is desperately in love with you .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t see why you should want me to go away on that account .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Good lord , man , don ’ t be so self-satisfied . Aren ’ t you surprised , aren ’ t you dumfounded that a pretty girl should fall in love with you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I thought it meant something when she dropped that rose .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Bless my stars , the dolt takes it as a matter of course .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m awfully flattered and all that sort of thing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>But not exactly surprised ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s not fair to ask a fellow a question like that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>At all events , you see now the necessity for depriving us for a time of your charming society .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Nothing will induce me to desert a post of danger . I ’ m going to face the music .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t be such an ass . It ’ s not you we ’ re thinking of , it ’ s that unfortunate girl .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t know why you think she ’ s unfortunate .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>But , my dear boy , she ’ s engaged to Gerald Hollington . Don ’ t you see how serious the whole thing is ? The only chance is for you to go away . We must try and make her forget you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I don ’ t want to do anybody a bad turn . I wouldn ’ t do anything to queer</l>
      <l>Gerald ’ s pitch for worlds .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>You must combine with us in order to save her from herself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>There ’ s no use in her eating her heart out for you , when she must inevitably marry Gerald .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Poor old Gerald , I told you he wasn ’ t the sort of chap a girl would be desperately in love with .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>The acumen you have shown does credit to your years .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Still , you know , I don ’ t think it ’ s wise for me to go away . Don ’ t you think it would be rather marked ? And they always say that absence makes the heart grow fonder .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>It was a woman who invented that proverb . There ’ s no truth in it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>What else can you suggest ? The fact remains that Nellie must be cured of this — of this passion .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>My own idea is that the best thing is for me to hang on here as if I knew nothing about it . I ’ ll take care to be very distant . I ’ ll ignore her as much as I can .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Will you promise to do that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , rather . I ’ ll let her see that I ’ m really a deuced dissipated dog .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t let her think you ’ re too great a devil with the ladies , or that ’ ll be the last straw . If there ’ s one thing a woman likes it ’ s a really bad man . She ’ ll start reforming you , and then there ’ ll be no holding her back .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>No , you must seem rather dull and stupid . Let her think you ’ re a bit of a milksop .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>FREDDIE looks at them suspiciously .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Look here , you ’ re not pulling my leg all the time , are you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>My dear , I should never take such a liberty .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t believe a word of what you ’ ve told me . Why should she care for me ? You ’ ve simply been humbugging me right and left .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>For a moment MRS . DOT is taken aback , but she sees LADY SELLENGER coming through the garden with GERALD .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Here ’ s Lady Sellenger . You won ’ t accuse her of trying to make a fool of you .<stage>LADY SELLENGER and GERALD appear .</stage>I ’ ve just been talking to Freddie about — about your girl .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>Oh yes .<stage>To FREDDIE .</stage>My poor boy , you ’ re in a very difficult position .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Then you know all about it , too ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>I really feel for you very much . You ’ ll want a great deal of tact and a great deal of courage . But you must do your duty .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She turns aside to BLENKINSOP .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p><stage>In an undertone to FREDDIE .</stage>Now have I been pulling your leg ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Poor girl !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes into the house .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking at him as he goes .</stage>What a beautiful and touching thing love is .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>You must take care , Lady Sellenger . You ’ re growing sentimental .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>But I ’ ve always been as sentimental as a schoolgirl in my heart . Only , so long as Nellie ’ s future was unarranged , I was obliged to keep a tight hand on myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Of course , Jimmie laughs ; he doesn ’ t know what love is .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>Have you never been loved for yourself , Mr. Blenkinsop ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>I have , but I have always found it deuced expensive .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m afraid Blenkinsop doesn ’ t set much store on the gentle sex .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t call them gentle . They ’ re very much rougher than men .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Stop him , or he ’ ll utter a whole string of horrors .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Have you never watched the gentle sex fight and push and scramble as it gets into the Hammersmith bus ? I assure you , the unlucky man who finds himself in that seething feminine crowd is fortunate if he escapes without losing an eye or half his teeth . And have you seen the fury of the gentle sex at a sale as they seize some worthless fragment , and the bitterness with which they haggle ? The other day I was in the Army and Navy Stores , and two women were standing on the stairs , discussing their servants , so that no one could pass up and down . I took off my hat and said : Excuse me , would you allow me to pass . They moved barely two inches , and one of them said in a loud voice to the other : What an impertinent man . The gentle sex ! Yesterday I was hanging on a strap in a crowded train coming from the city , and I saw a pale-faced weary clerk give up his seat to a strong and bouncing girl . She took it without saying thank you , because she was a lady and he wasn ’ t a gentleman . Then a tired old woman came in and stood , but the bouncing girl never thought of giving up the seat to her . The gentle sex ! They have such tender hearts they couldn ’ t bear to hurt a fly . Have you ever seen a woman get out of a bus ten yards before her destination in order to save the wretched horses another start ? Not much . Have you ever known a woman of fashion who sends her maid to bed when she knows she won ’ t be in till four in the morning ? Not much . And is there anything like the insolence with which a woman treats her social inferiors of the same sex ? Is it men who put on their backs the sealskins that are torn off the living bodies of helpless brutes ? Is it men who put on their hats the beautiful birds of the forest ? It ’ s the gentle sex . Boys are taught manners . They are taught to take off their hats and hold open the door for their sisters . They are taught to fetch and carry for women , and to give up the front seat in life to women . But what are girls taught ? Girls are taught etiquette , and that , I suppose , makes them in due course the gentle sex .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>Every one knows you ’ re a horrible cynic , so there can ’ t be a word of truth in anything you say .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Q. E. D .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Here comes Nellie .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>NELLIE comes in , having changed her dress . She now wears a very pretty white frock , all flounces and furbelows , and a large white hat . At the same moment from the other side FREDDIE enters . He also has changed , and is now in spotless white .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a laugh , whispering to BLENKINSOP .</stage>They ’ ve both changed their clothes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Would you like to come for a row , Nellie ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m too tired . Won ’ t you go with Mrs . Dot ? I ’ ll rest here till tea-time .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>NELLIE sits down , and the others go .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>Personally , I must walk . I sacrifice all my inclinations to my fear of growing too stout . I often wonder if we shall get our good dinners in heaven that we ’ ve done without on earth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s generally understood that we shall only get our deserts .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>NELLIE watches them go from over her shoulder . She sees that FREDDIE is hanging back . She smiles and elaborately disregards him . He comes forward and leans over her chair .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>Aren ’ t you going with the others ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Do you mind if I stay with you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>I like it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Jolly here , isn ’ t it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>Awfully jolly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve not congratulated you on your engagement yet .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>I didn ’ t expect you would .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I don ’ t know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>It seems a long time since we first met , doesn ’ t it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>Why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Because I seem to know you so well .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>You ’ re very easy to get to know , aren ’ t you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I say , you look just like another rose in this garden .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>I suppose you say that to every girl who sits here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve never said it to any one but you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>They tell me you ’ re very impressionable .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>They lie .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>I think I shall take off my hat .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , do .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She proceeds to do so . She pretends that she cannot .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , how stupid of me ! Something has caught .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>May I help you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m afraid I ’ m giving you a lot of trouble .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He helps her , and she gives a little scream .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I ’ m so sorry . Did I hurt you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>No , but it tickled .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She takes off the hat . One hand of hers remains in his . Their eyes meet for the first time , and they smile .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I say , what a pretty hand you have ! It looks so white on mine , doesn ’ t it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MRS . DOT creeps back and stands behind a bush , so that she cannot be seen .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>I rather like your hand . It ’ s so strong and brown .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>You know , you ’ re awfully easy to get on with . Sometimes I feel dreadfully shy and nervous with women , but I can think of all sorts of things I want to say to you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>I seem to have known you all my life .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Impulsively .</stage>Isn ’ t it jolly here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>Awfully jolly .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He looks at her for a moment .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I want to ask you something . You won ’ t be angry , will you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>May I kiss you ?</p>

     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s awfully unkind of you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>You shouldn ’ t have asked .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Shouldn ’ t I ? I wanted to , badly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>There are some things one should do without asking .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>You are a brick .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He kisses her . As he does so , HOLLINGTON comes in and sees them . He stops for a moment in astonishment , then withdraws .</stage>

     <p>Let ’ s go on the river , shall we ?</p>

     <p>Oh , hang Gerald !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>We might go and play the piano in the drawing-room .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Ah , you mustn ’ t recall what I said when I was in a temper . You know , I ’ m rather touched by her obvious affection for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s very good of you to say so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s so nice to see two people head over ears in love with one another .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I wouldn ’ t be so presumptuous as to think Nellie was so much in love with me as all that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>My dear boy , I ’ ve just had proof of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Have you ? That ’ s more than I have .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>And is dear Lady Sellenger going to live with you when you ’ re married ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Look here , Dot , what ’ s the meaning of all this ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p><stage>Much surprised .</stage>Of what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Why did you ask us all down ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Because I ’ m of a hospitable turn of mind . Didn ’ t you want to come ? I ’ m so sorry .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>You ’ ve utterly ignored me since I arrived .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p><stage>Ironically .</stage>Much as I should have liked to devote myself exclusively to your entertainment , I ’ ve been really obliged to remember that my other guests had equal claims upon me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I should very much like to take you by the shoulders and give you a good shaking .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t think you ’ re in a very good temper to-day .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Crossly .</stage>Pardon me , I ’ m in the best possible temper .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>You certainly ought to be with the prospect of spending a week in almost uninterrupted tête-à-tête with the object of your affections .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I can ’ t make you out . You ’ re so changed since last we met .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>You see , last time I thought I was in love with you . Now I know I ’ m not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Bitterly .</stage>I ’ m glad you ’ ve got over it so quickly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Really , you couldn ’ t wish me to continue eating my heart out for a young man , however charming , who is going to marry somebody else .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Of course not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p><stage>Mockingly .</stage>Well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I was a fool to think you ever cared at all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>But why should you think it when you took the greatest pains to assure me that you didn ’ t care two straws for me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quickly .</stage>I didn ’ t !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>You did !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I didn ’ t !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Then you did care for me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I never said that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Anyhow , whatever your sentiments were , it would gratify your self-esteem to think that I was languishing with a hopeless passion .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s cruel of you to laugh at me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>By the way , are you by any chance in love with me now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>You have no right to ask me that question .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>My dear boy , I ’ m not keeping you from spending an idyllic afternoon with Nellie . You ’ ve forced this conversation upon me . I assure you it ’ s most distasteful .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>If I had married you , I should certainly have beaten you with a big stick .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>What do you think is my chief characteristic ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s a question I can answer . The most confounded and aggravating unreasonableness that I ever saw .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Nonsense . It ’ s obvious that my chief characteristic is a sweet and yielding nature . But as there ’ s no likelihood of our agreeing on that , what do you think is the second ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Obstinacy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Well , I prefer to call it strength of mind . Now , I ’ ll acknowledge that I was in love with you — a month ago . That ’ s a feather in your cap .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I wish we were back again . I ’ ve had such rotten luck .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>But when I saw that my sweetness was likely to be wasted on the desert air , I made up my mind to cure myself . First I cried for two days .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Dot .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>No , don ’ t sympathise . I have rather a high colour , and when I ’ ve had a good cry it always improves my complexion . After that , I ordered some new frocks , and I bought a diamond necklace that I ’ d been hankering after for some time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>And that thoroughly consoled you , I suppose ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>It helped . Then I came to the conclusion that there were as good fish in the sea as ever came out of it . I thought you over . After all , you ’ re not really very good-looking , are you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m not aware that I ever made any pretence of being so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>And I ’ m sure no one could accuse you of being extremely amusing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I have no doubt I ’ m excessively dull .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I couldn ’ t help seeing that you ’ d suit Nellie much better than you would have suited me . She has that comfortable stupidity which the average Englishman looks upon as the highest recommendation for a wife .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s charming of you to say so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>She is a little dull , isn ’ t she ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t think her so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Doesn ’ t time hang rather heavily on your hands now and then ? Isn ’ t it difficult to find topics of conversation ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t find it so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Ah — she does .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>And the long and short of it is that the emotion which you dignify with the name of love , had entirely disappeared after a week .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Make it ten days to be on the safe side .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I congratulate you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>You wouldn ’ t have it otherwise , surely ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Of course not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Then all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Furiously .</stage>I think you must be quite heartless .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p><stage>Delighted .</stage>Ah , that ’ s what I said to you a month ago , Philippine .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Now , perhaps , you ’ d like to know what my feeling is towards you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>No , I ’ m quite indifferent , thanks !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Well , I shall tell you for all that . It ’ s a joke to you , and you can afford to laugh at it .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes up to her and then stops suddenly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Nothing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Oh ! My poor heart went pit-a-pat . I thought you were going to kiss me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I hate you . And I wish I ’ d never set eyes on you .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He turns on his heel and walks out quickly . As soon as he is gone MRS . DOT begins to dance a break-down . She cocks a snook after him .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ll marry you yet , you beast , I ’ ll marry you yet .</p>

     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>What on earth is the matter with you now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>From inside is heard the sound of a cake-walk .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Come on .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She seizes him and begins to dance .</stage>

     <p>Oh , you dear , you dear , you dear .</p>

    <stage>She flings both arms round his neck and kisses him soundly . At this moment GERALD returns .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I beg your pardon . I forgot my hat .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He takes it and goes out stiffly . MRS . DOT bursts into a shriek of laughter .</stage>

     <p>Now , you really mustn ’ t waste this beautiful afternoon . You must go and have a nice long walk together .</p>

     <p>We spent the whole afternoon on the river yesterday , and you kindly gave us our tea to take with us .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>It reminds me of the happy days when I was engaged to your poor father , Nellie . We were just like you and Gerald . We couldn ’ t bear to be out of one another ’ s sight . Now , run and get your hat , darling .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , mamma , I ’ ve got the most dreadful headache that I ’ ve ever had in my life , and I must really go and lie down .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>Nonsense . An afternoon in the fresh air with Gerald is just the thing to put you right .</p>

     <p>In that case I shall be only too glad to go on the river .</p>

     <p><stage>With a look of intelligence .</stage>Dear Mr. Blenkinsop , you wicked , wicked cynic .<stage>Meaningly .</stage>I shall go and lie down . Are you coming upstairs , Miss MacGregor ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNT ELIZA</speaker>
     <p>In one minute .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>I want to have a little talk with you .<stage>As BLENKINSOP holds open the door for her , in a whisper .</stage>Aren ’ t I tactful ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>LADY SELLENGER goes out .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>What villainy is that old woman up to now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>You idiot ! Don ’ t you see that she ’ s discovered the passion that devours our hearts — your manly bosom and my timid , fluttering heart — and she wants to leave us alone .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m beginning to feel very unwell .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p><stage>Archly .</stage>Wouldn ’ t you be rather flattered if I really were in love with you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Alarmed .</stage>Dot , don ’ t make these horrible suggestions . You make my flesh creep .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>But you ’ ve been so cold , you haven ’ t given me a chance .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Cold ! Heaven knows what would have happened if I ’ d given you any encouragement . I ’ ve never been able to take my eyes off the ground without finding yours fixed on me with the languishing expression of a dying duck in a thunderstorm . I ’ ve never been able to go near you without your stroking me as if I were a velvet cushion or a Persian cat . I ’ ve not eaten a single meal in peace in case you suddenly took it into your head to press my foot under the table .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>What would you have done if I had ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p><stage>With outraged dignity .</stage>I should have screamed ! And the thought of that special licence has cast a chill in my heart . I don ’ t know what it ’ s all coming to . You are my witness , Miss MacGregor , that I won ’ t marry her , however deeply she compromises me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNT ELIZA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>I am your witness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>She shan ’ t make an honest man of me .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MRS . DOT takes from a drawer of the escritoire one of the licences .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>I feel as though some one were walking over my grave .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNT ELIZA</speaker>
     <p>But how on earth are you going to get Nellie Sellenger and Freddie to use the other licence ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>When the right moment comes I shall leave it under their noses , and allow them to draw what consequences they choose .... If any woman ever earned a husband , I have . I ’ ve taken every opportunity to snub Gerald till he can hardly contain himself with rage . I ’ ve thrown him in Nellie ’ s company till they ’ re both so bored they could almost cry . I ’ ve been constantly on the watch to prevent Nellie and Freddie from having two minutes by themselves till they can hardly bear the sight of me . And I ’ ve made love to you with a persistence that would have melted the heart of a fish . If I fail , it will be your fault .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>But what on earth do you want me to do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Good heavens , throw a little passion into your behaviour . Look at me as though you ’ d never seen any one so ravishing in your life . When you take my hand , hold it as if you would never let it go .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She takes his hand .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Remember , there ’ s no one but Miss MacGregor present .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a yearning glance .</stage>Look into my eyes like this .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t . You make me feel very uncomfortable .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p><stage>Impatiently .</stage>Oh , you ’ re too stupid . You ’ re a stock and a stone . You ’ re an owl . You ’ re a ridiculous idiot .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Temper , temper .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>You ’ ll ruin my whole life , because you ’ re such a perfect fool that you can ’ t make love to a woman .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She breaks away from him and begins to cry . He walks up and down , then looks at her with a smile . He makes a sign to MISS MACGREGOR that MRS . DOT cannot see .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a different voice .</stage>Dot , this little game of ours has lasted long enough .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sobbing in her handkerchief .</stage>Yes , it has . I ’ m sick to death of the whole thing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>You asked me to play a part , and you didn ’ t know that it might be deadly earnest .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Fiddlesticks !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>I have a secret that I can no longer keep from you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Well , tell it to the horse-marines .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Dot , I love you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Oh , don ’ t be so silly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>But I tell you I ’ m not joking .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Thank heaven for that . I ’ m weary of your bad jokes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>The thing started as a bad joke , but it has ended in something very different . A change has come over me , and I ’ m ashamed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking up .</stage>Eh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t you see that I ’ m a different man ? Dot , it ’ s you who ’ ve changed me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I really believe he ’ s waking up .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>If I was shy and awkward , it ’ s because I wouldn ’ t give in to myself . I was overwhelmed . I couldn ’ t understand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s much better . There really is a ring of emotion in your voice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>How shouldn ’ t there be , when I ’ m saying at last what has trembled on the tip of my tongue for ten days ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p><stage>Delighted .</stage>There ! That ’ s just the tone I want . Talk with that quiver in your voice when you ask me to pass you the mustard at dinner .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>I lie awake at night thinking of you , and when I fall asleep I seem to hold you in my arms .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s splendid . Why couldn ’ t you say all this before ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Dot , Dot , don ’ t torture me . Don ’ t you see I mean it .</p>

     <p>What !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m not jesting now . I wish to heaven I were .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>You must be mad or blind . Can ’ t you feel that I love you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t be so absurd . You know you ’ re only — you ’ re only pulling my leg .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I ’ ve been a perfect ass . I should never have consented to play this ghastly trick . If you only knew what tortures I ’ ve suffered !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>He isn ’ t really serious , Aunt Eliza ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNT ELIZA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>Upon my soul , it looks very much like it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>What did you expect ? You ’ ve played on my heart-strings as though they were an instrument that had no feeling . You ’ ve put a caress into every tone of your voice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p><stage>Ruefully .</stage>Of course , I am fascinating . I can ’ t deny that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>When you touched my hand , every nerve of my body thrilled .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>You ’ re not really in love with me ?</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>I was a fool . I played with fire , and I never dreamed I ’ d burn myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>But you mustn ’ t be in love with me . I won ’ t hear of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s too late to say that now . I adore you .</p>

     <p>But what on earth ’ s to be done ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>You must marry me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Nothing will induce me to do anything of the sort .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Going up to her with outstretched arms .</stage>You can ’ t realise the wealth of tenderness and affection which I ’ ll lavish upon you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Go away ! Don ’ t come near me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Why should you care for Gerald ? Do you think if he loved you , he would let a trifling engagement with somebody else stand in the way ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>The fact is that men are never to be trusted .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>I can ’ t live without you now . I ’ ll give up my whole life to make you happy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>But I ’ m in love with Gerald . I ’ m not in love with you . I shall never be in love with you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>You owe me something for all the agony you ’ ve made me endure . Dot , remember that licence . It was bought in jest , but the Archbishop of Canterbury was in earnest .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>But my dear James , for heaven ’ s sake be reasonable . You know just as well as I do that you ’ re not a marrying man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Give me the chance , and you ’ ll see .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m awfully extravagant , and if the Government brings in temperance legislation I shall be ruined .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>Dot , Dot !</p>

    <stage>He catches her in his arms and kisses her . At this moment GERALD comes in , MRS . DOT breaks away from BLENKINSOP . There is an awkward pause .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p><stage>To GERALD .</stage>I thought you were on the river .</p>

     <p>Hang the river !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She goes to the door , which BLENKINSOP opens for her . She goes out . As AUNT ELIZA follows , he speaks to her in a low tone .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>There ’ s passion for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNT ELIZA</speaker>
     <p>You brutes , you can all do it . You positively made my heart beat .</p>

    <stage>She goes out .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>What did Miss MacGregor say ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>A vague suggestion of bigamy if I understood correctly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Frigidly .</stage>I ’ m afraid I came at an inopportune moment .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>It appears to be one of your happy little ways .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Every one seems to kiss every one else in this house .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p><stage>With effrontery .</stage>You have only to envelop Lady Sellenger in your arms , and the picture will be complete .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Would you kindly explain this incident ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>If you ’ ll allow me to say so , I really can ’ t see that it ’ s any business of yours .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hotly .</stage>Look here , Blenkinsop , you ’ ve got no right to play your fool-tricks with Mrs . Dot . She ’ s a very excitable and thoughtless woman . She ’ s ....</p>

     <p>Well ?</p>

     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Oh , damn you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Not at all , not at all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Angrily .</stage>What the deuce is the meaning of all this tomfoolery ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Blandly .</stage>I suppose you couldn ’ t be a little more civil , could you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Look here , Blenkinsop , the best thing you can do is to receive a telegram that requires your immediate presence in town .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Thanks very much , but I ’ m extremely comfortable down here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>You ’ d be rather surprised if I threw you out of the window , wouldn ’ t you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>I should not only be surprised , but I should look upon it as an odious familiarity .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Would you like to know my private opinion of you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Spare me my blushes , dear boy . It always embarrasses me to be flattered to my face .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>You silly old fool .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>I believe you ’ re considerably annoyed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Not in the least . What the dickens is there about you that should annoy me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Now that I come to think of it , you are certainly in a passion . Your face is red , your attire is disordered , and you have a slight squint in your eye .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>My dear fellow , if I hadn ’ t the best temper in the world , I should kick you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>You ’ d far better go and lie down . You ’ ll only say something which you ’ ll regret .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I suppose you ’ re not for a moment under the impression that Mrs . Dot cares twopence about you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>May I ask how that can in the least concern you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Mrs . Dot is an old friend of mine . I ’ m not going to see her made ridiculous by a conceited nincompoop .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>By the way , has it slipped your memory that you ’ re engaged to Miss</l>
      <l>Sellenger ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Good Lord , no !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>I daresay you wish it had .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s a confounded impertinent thing to say .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>My dear fellow , I never saw any one with less common sense in my life . Surely it ’ s not very extraordinary that the same tender passion which inflames the chaste breasts of yourself and Miss Sellenger , should attack the equally chaste breasts of myself and Mrs. Worthley .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t talk such twaddle .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>I suppose you ’ d be considerably astonished if I told you that I ’ d just asked Mrs . Dot to be my wife .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>She must have screamed with laughter .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>You noticed her unconcealed hilarity when you came in .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Going up to him quickly .</stage>You don ’ t mean it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>No man is quite safe from the toils of women till he ’ s safely in his grave . And even then a feminine worm probably makes a dead set at him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>And does Mrs . Dot — reciprocate your affection ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Really you ask me a very delicate question .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>By the great Harry , the man thinks she ’ s in love with him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rather indignant .</stage>And pray , why shouldn ’ t she be just as much in love with me as with you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a burst of laughter .</stage>Ha , ha , ha .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>What the blazes are you laughing at ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Ha ! ha ! ha !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Shut up , you blithering idiot !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Still laughing .</stage>She has made a fool of you . Ha ! ha ! ha !<stage>Seriously .</stage>And did you really think any woman would care for you ? My poor Blenkinsop ! My poor , poor Blenkinsop !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>You ’ re a jackanapes , sir , you ’ re an impudent jackanapes . And why not , pray ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p><stage>Furiously .</stage>Because you ’ re revolting to look upon , and your conversation is inexpressibly tedious .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s charming of you to say so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>If you want to marry any one , marry Lady Sellenger .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>You are evidently under the impression that if a woman can ’ t be so fortunate as to marry you , she had far better retire into a nunnery .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>You ’ re a cantankerous cynic and a fatuous donkey .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>I like the delicacy with which you express your appreciation of my merits .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Listen to me , Blenkinsop ! Clear out of the house before you make a greater mess of things than you have already . Mrs . Dot would as soon marry her groom as marry you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>You think it ’ s quite impossible that she should ever have dreamt of such a thing ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Not only impossible , but grotesque .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>BLENKINSOP goes to the drawer in which is the licence and takes it out .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps , then , it would interest you to inspect this document .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>GERALD takes it and looks at it , dumfounded .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s a special licence .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>So much less bother than banns , you know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>James Blenkinsop .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>And Frances Annandale Worthley .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s a mistake ! It ’ s all a preposterous mistake .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>You see , the Archbishop of Canterbury calls me his right well-beloved brother . Friendly , isn ’ t it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>GERALD violently tears it in pieces and flings them on the ground . BLENKINSOP gives a sigh of relief . GERALD stalks out of the room into the garden . BLENKINSOP goes to the door and waves his hand at him . MRS . DOT comes in . She has discovered that BLENKINSOP has been making a fool of her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>He ’ s torn up your precious licence .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quickly .</stage>Which one ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Ours , of course . Three guineas gone bang , my dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Counting on her fingers .</stage>
      <l>I ’ m reckoning how many bottles of beer the</l>
      <l>British public will have to drink for us to buy another .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>But your refusal of my hand will happily prevent you from going to that expense . Thereby considerably forwarding the cause of temperance .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p><stage>With an assumption of overwhelming gravity .</stage>James , I have been thinking over all you said , and I am willing to marry you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p><stage>A chill going down his spine .</stage>I thank you from the bottom of my heart , but I cannot accept this sacrifice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>It is no sacrifice when I think that I can make you happy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>But you mustn ’ t think of me . It ’ s your happiness that we have to consider . Don ’ t let a momentary impulse ruin your whole life .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve thought it over very carefully . I cannot resist your passionate pleading .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>I will not be outdone in generosity . You have refused me . I accept your refusal as final .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I never realised that your nature was so great and tender . Every word you say makes me more determined to devote my life to your happiness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>My dear Dot , much as I appreciate the beauty of your sentiments , I must confess that I could never marry a woman who did not love me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p><stage>As though she were struggling with her modesty .</stage>I see that you want to force from me the avowal that is so hard to make . Oh , you men !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Good God , you don ’ t mean to say you ’ re in love with me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p><stage>Languishing .</stage>James . Is it so very wonderful ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Half an hour ago you said you couldn ’ t stand me at any price .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s a woman ’ s privilege to change her mind . The passion which you threw into your proposal has completely changed me . I am touched by the vehemence with which you flung your heart at my feet . I have struggled , but I cannot resist . Take me in your arms , James , and never let me go .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>Dot , I have a confession to make to you . I didn ’ t mean a word I said .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Ah , James , do not jest .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>I assure you I ’ m perfectly serious . You taunted me that I couldn ’ t make love , so I just let myself go to show you I could . I daresay it was a silly joke , but it certainly was a joke .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p><stage>Unmoved .</stage>James , every word you say increases my admiration for you . I can ’ t think now how I was ever blind to your great affection .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>But don ’ t you hear what I say ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Do you think you can take me in so easily ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>You don ’ t believe me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Not a word .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>I say , look here , this is a bit too thick .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I know you only say these cruel things because you think I should be throwing myself away on you .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p><stage>Huffily .</stage>I don ’ t know about that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>You cannot bear to think that I should accept you from pity . But it isn ’ t that , James . You are handsome and noble and chivalrous . How shouldn ’ t a woman love you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>I repeat that I do not reciprocate your passion .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>You can ’ t deceive me so easily as that , James . I know you love me . We women have such quick intuitions .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>So you always say .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I see you simply quivering with restrained emotion . Oh , James , James , you ’ ve made me so happy .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She flings herself on his bosom and pretends to burst into tears .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>I say , take care . Supposing somebody saw us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I should like all the world to see us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>But it ’ s devilish compromising .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I want to compromise myself . Only thus can I make you certain of my love . Oh , think of the many happy years we shall spend in one another ’ s arms , James .</p>

     <p>Oh , what it is to have a fool for a servant ! Take a month ’ s notice . I dismiss you . Where to , sir ? Anywhere , sir ? Somewhere that ’ s a damned long way off . South Africa ! I ’ ll go and shoot lions in Uganda . And if there isn ’ t a boat sailing at once , I ’ ll go to America and shoot grizzlies in the Rocky Mountains .</p>

     <p><stage>Trying to restrain himself .</stage>Pet !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes into the garden . MRS . DOT begins to laugh . FREDDIE comes in , with letters in his hand .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I say , I wish you ’ d just have a look at these letters .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Oh , yes . I want to have a little talk with you , Freddie .<stage>She takes one of the letters and reads .</stage>“ I am directed by Mrs. Worthley to congratulate you on the recent addition to your family , but to express her regret that she cannot accede to your request .” How brutal you are , Freddie ! Surely Mrs. Murphy is an old friend .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I looked her out in my note-book . Six months ago we sent her fifteen pounds because she had nine children . Now she has eleven .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>And yet they complain that the birth-rate is falling . I think we ’ d better send her five pounds .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>You really can ’ t encourage a woman who has twins twice a year , when her husband is not only bed-ridden but a hopeless lunatic .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps she is a little prolific .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Here is my answer to Mrs. MacTavish , who wants help to bury a husband .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Poor thing ! You ’ d better send her ten pounds .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve answered : “ Madam , I regret to see that this is the third time you have lost your husband within two years . The mortality among the unhappy gentlemen on whom you bestow your hand is so great that I can only recommend you in future to remain a widow . Yours faithfully , Frederick Perkins .”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p><stage>Reading a letter which he hands to her .</stage>“ I am pleased to hear that the wooden leg for which Mrs. Worthley paid for last year has proved satisfactory , but I cannot recommend her to provide you with another . To lose one leg in a railway accident is a misfortune , but to lose a second in a colliery explosion points to carelessness .” That ’ s not original , Freddie .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m so hard up , I can only afford to make other people ’ s jokes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a shrewd look at him .</stage>Freddie , I ’ ve been exceedingly pleased with your behaviour during the last week . I ’ ve watched you carefully , and I ’ m glad to see that you ’ ve done all that was possible to destroy poor Nellie ’ s affection for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gravely .</stage>I ’ ve tried to do my duty .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I know . And in recognition of this I want you to accept a little present . Where is my cheque-book ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Producing it promptly .</stage>Oh , no , really , I shouldn ’ t like you to do anything of the sort .<stage>Putting it in front of her , and giving her a pen .</stage>I feel that I ’ m amply paid for all that I do for you . I simply can ’ t accept anything more .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I was afraid you would object .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She writes , and he watches her carefully .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Five hundred pounds . Oh , you are a ripper ! But why on earth do you give me that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>It may be useful to you . Suppose you had an idea of getting married , for instance , it would be very convenient to have a sum like that in your pocket .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>But I ’ m not thinking of getting married .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Aren ’ t you ? I suppose you know that when you do , I ’ m proposing to give you two thousand a year .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I say , that ’ s awfully good of you .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He takes the cheque and gloats over it . MRS . DOT quickly takes a special licence out of the drawer and puts it on the table .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Now I ’ m going for a turn in the garden .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>You are a brick .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She goes out . As soon as he sees the coast is clear , he gives a peculiar whistle . NELLIE comes in .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>I thought your whistle was never coming . They wanted me to go on the river . I had to invent all sorts of excuses .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t know how it is , but somehow we never manage to get a minute by ourselves .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s perfectly maddening . What a good idea it was of yours to meet in the garden after they ’ d all gone to bed .</p>
    </sp>

     <p><stage>With wounded dignity .</stage>It ’ s not likely I should have proposed a thing like that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>No , it isn ’ t likely .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m perfectly distracted . If you only knew how that man bores me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I can ’ t think what you ever saw in him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>I was never really fond of him , you know . I only accepted him because he was so desperately in love with me , and mamma wouldn ’ t hear of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>When did you first know that you cared for me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I don ’ t know . I think as soon as ever I found out you were in love with me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rather taken aback .</stage>Oh !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>When did you begin to love me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Well , you know , I was awfully flattered by your caring for me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh !...<stage>There is a pause .</stage>I don ’ t think I quite understand .</p>

     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Cuddling in them .</stage>Oh , it makes me feel so delightfully wicked . I know I oughtn ’ t to let you kiss me . I know it ’ s treachery to poor Gerald .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>He isn ’ t worthy of you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>He simply worships the ground I tread on . I am a perfect beast .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>We ’ re treating him shamefully .</p>

     <p>I shall never forgive myself .</p>

    <sp>

     <p>Poor Gerald .... He is an ass , isn ’ t he ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Did I leave my scissors here ? Just see if you can find them , Freddie . Perhaps they ’ re in the next room .<stage>He goes out .</stage>I wonder if I left them on the writing-table .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>NELLIE looks , sees the licence , starts , and turns round to hide it .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Agitated .</stage>No , there ’ s nothing here at all .</p>

     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>Thanks so much .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She goes out .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>Freddie , how could you be so incautious ? It was only by the greatest presence of mind that I was able to hide it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>What do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>You ought to have told me . I don ’ t think it was nice of you to get a licence without saying a word to me about it . I think it was a great liberty .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>A licence ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>You must know that I can ’ t marry you . Nothing will induce me to break my promise to Gerald . I ’ m very angry with you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>I haven ’ t the least idea what you ’ re talking about .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>How can you tell such stories ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She hands him the licence . He stares at it , utterly astonished .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Where did you find this ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>It was lying on the writing-table . I suppose you ’ re not going to deny all knowledge of it .<stage>He stares at it still .</stage>Freddie , how bold of you ! But you really couldn ’ t imagine for a moment that I ’ d consent to run away with you . Oh , Freddie , I ’ m so flattered . How you must love me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>To himself .</stage>Two thousand a year !<stage>He takes the cheque from his pocket and looks at it . Suddenly light dawns on him . He puts cheque and licence back into his pocket .</stage>It ’ s fairly clear that a licence couldn ’ t have got there by itself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>What on earth made you think of sending for it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Brazenly .</stage>I thought it was the only way to win you .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>Have you had it long ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>It only arrived this morning . Look here , why shouldn ’ t we bolt ? You don ’ t care a straw for Gerald , and you do care for me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>It would break his heart . I couldn ’ t , I couldn ’ t ! Besides , where are we to bolt to ? I daren ’ t . Mamma would never forgive me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>You see , with this we can be married anywhere . Let ’ s jump into the motor and go down to my father near Oxford . We shall arrive by dinner-time , and he ’ ll marry us to-morrow morning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>You don ’ t mean to say your father ’ s in the Church ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Of course he ’ s in the Church . I was most careful in my choice of a parent .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , how clever of you to have a father who ’ s a clergyman ! You think of everything , Freddie .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>Look here , there ’ s not a minute to waste . Will you risk it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>No , no , no ! Freddie , how can you ask me such a thing .... I ’ ll just go and put on my hat .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDDIE</speaker>
     <p>You brick .</p>

    <stage>She runs out . He walks up and down excitedly . The servants bring in the tea . NELLIE comes back with her hat on .</stage>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>I know . You asked him to name the day .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>I feel that I have no right to restrain any longer the very natural impatience of these young things .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Aghast .</stage>And what did Gerald say ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>He wishes to leave it entirely to you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m sure that ’ s very obliging of him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>Not at all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>

     <p><stage>Grimly .</stage>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>I would much sooner — let Gerald fix it at his own convenience .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>I think it ’ s delightful , the way they give in to one another .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>We shall only bore Mrs . Dot if we discuss the matter now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>We ’ re all old friends here . I ’ m sure Mrs . Dot will help us with her advice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS . DOT</speaker>
     <p>My own opinion is , that in these matters the sooner the better .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLENKINSOP</speaker>
     <p>When you have to take a pill the best thing is to swallow it down without thinking .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>Cynic ! What do you say to six weeks from to-day ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>That would suit me beautifully .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Perkins has promised to take me for a little drive in the motor . I feel it ’ s the only thing to send away my headache .</p>

     <p><stage>In an undertone .</stage>My darling , is this wise ? Remember the feelings of this poor young man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NELLIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Also in an undertone .</stage>I thought you ’ d like an opportunity of talking privately to Gerald .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>Why , darling ?</p>
    </sp>

    <stage>She goes out with FREDDIE . Almost immediately the sound of a motor-horn is heard , as they drive away .</stage>

     <speaker>LADY SELLENGER</speaker>
     <p>The dear child , she has such a sweet , trusting nature . You must kiss me , too , Gerald !</p>

     <speaker>GERALD</speaker>
     <p>I shall be delighted , I ’ m sure .</p>

    <stage>She puts up her cheek , which he kisses . A SERVANT comes in with a</stage>
   </div>
  </body>
  <back>
   <note>note . SERVANT . Miss Sellenger told me to give you this at once , Madam . MRS . DOT . Oh . [ She opens it and gives a cry . ] Good heavens ! Oh , the deceitful wretch ! Lady Sellenger , how shall I tell you ? It ’ s from Nellie . LADY SELLENGER . From Nellie ! MRS . DOT . [ Reading . ] “ Dear Mrs . Dot , I ’ m just off to marry Freddie . Break it to Mamma gently .” LADY SELLENGER . [ Starting up . ] Impossible ! Stop them ! Stop them ! Where are they ? MRS . DOT . [ Reading . ] “ I couldn ’ t marry Gerald . He ’ s too great a ”— there ’ s a word in big letters . I never could read capitals . [ She hands the note to GERALD . GERALD . The word is “ B . O. R. E .” MRS . DOT . [ Pretending to be much surprised . ] Bore ! BLENKINSOP . [ With immense satisfaction . ] Bore ! AUNT ELIZA . [ Meditatively . ] Bore ! LADY SELLENGER . Oh , how monstrous ! My poor Gerald , what shall I do ? [ GERALD goes into a roar of laughter . He laughs louder and louder . LADY SELLENGER . Gerald ! Gerald ! Don ’ t ! Pull yourself together . The poor boy , he ’ s perfectly hysterical . Where are my salts ? Mrs . Dot , for heaven ’ s sake calm him down . Oh , my dear ! You mustn ’ t upset yourself yet . BLENKINSOP . He looks cut up , doesn ’ t he ? LADY SELLENGER . We ’ ll pursue them . There ’ s no harm done yet . We ’ ll catch them . I promise you we ’ ll catch them . You shall marry her , Gerald , if I have to drag her to church by the hair of her head . [ At this he stops suddenly and stares at her in dismay . GERALD . What are you going to do ? LADY SELLENGER . We must chase them . Where ’ s your motor , Mr. Blenkinsop ? Didn ’ t you tell me it was the fastest machine in England ? BLENKINSOP . I did say something of the sort . LADY SELLENGER . We shall catch them up . Gerald , you must drive me . I can ’ t trust any one else to go fast enough . MRS . DOT . But you don ’ t know which way they ’ ve gone . LADY SELLENGER . Don ’ t be so silly . Of course they ’ ve gone to Brighton . When people elope they always go to Brighton . [ MRS . DOT slips out of the room . GERALD . And what ’ ll you do if we come up to them ? You can ’ t force them to come back . LADY SELLENGER . If a woman can ’ t force her daughter to marry any man she chooses , I don ’ t know what the English nation is coming to . GERALD . I won ’ t marry the girl against her will . LADY SELLENGER . Fiddlededee ! Of course you ’ ll marry her . Who is this creature she ’ s run away with ? Perkins ! Perkins with a P. I never heard anything so ridiculous . Do you suppose my daughter is going to be Mrs. Perkins — Perkins with a P ? BLENKINSOP . You couldn ’ t very well spell it with a W could you ? LADY SELLENGER . Hold your impudent tongue , sir ! GERALD . Now , let ’ s have this out and be done with it . I ’ m no more in love with Nellie than she is with me , I was going to marry her because I ’ d promised to , and it seemed a low down trick to draw back .... LADY SELLENGER . The man ’ s mad . The shock has turned his brain . GERALD . When I heard she ’ d bolted , I could have jumped for joy . I seem to have awaked out of a ghastly nightmare . Nothing will induce me to try and catch her up . LADY SELLENGER . You monster ! How dare you trifle with the affections of my daughter ! You don ’ t mean to stand by and see her marry a man called Perkins ! GERALD . I wouldn ’ t even mind if she married a man called Vere de Vere . LADY SELLENGER . Very well , then , the chauffeur shall drive me . You ’ re a heartless brute . Perkins with a P. And penniless to boot . [ She flounces out of the room and bangs the door . GERALD . Where ’ s Mrs . Dot ? [ He goes into the garden . BLENKINSOP . What a charming mother-in-law that woman will make ! [ MRS . DOT comes in with a large kitchen knife in one hand and a poker in the other . MRS . DOT . I ’ ve done it ! BLENKINSOP . Done what ? MRS . DOT . Lady Sellenger thinks she ’ s going in your motor , but she isn ’ t . BLENKINSOP . [ Starting up . ] What have you done to my motor ? MRS . DOT . As soon as she talked of it , I ran to the kitchen and seized this knife and I seized this poker . BLENKINSOP . Woman ! MRS . DOT . I ’ ve ripped up all the tyres , they ’ re simply in ribands , James . BLENKINSOP . Good Lord ! MRS . DOT . I don ’ t know what I ’ ve done to the steering gear , but I know it ’ ll never work again . Oh , it ’ s in an awful state . BLENKINSOP . But that ’ s a bran-new motor . I ’ ve just paid eighteen hundred pounds for it . MRS . DOT . And so that there shouldn ’ t be any risk I opened the place where the works are , and I rummaged around with the poker . I think I ’ ve smashed everything . BLENKINSOP . Oh ! Oh ! [ He buries his head in his hands . MRS . DOT . The thing ’ s a wreck and a ruin . You should have seen the tyres go flop , flop , flop . BLENKINSOP . But I ’ m going to race next week . MRS . DOT . It ’ ll be impossible to move it for a month . It is in a state . BLENKINSOP . Eighteen hundred pounds ! MRS . DOT . I don ’ t know how much it ’ ll cost to put right . You don ’ t mind , James , do you ? BLENKINSOP . Mind ! MRS . DOT . I shouldn ’ t like you to be cross with me . BLENKINSOP . [ Furiously . ] Oh ! MRS . DOT . You won ’ t let this disturb your affection for me ? Remember that you ’ re going to marry me . BLENKINSOP . Marry you . I ’ d rather marry my cook . [ He flings out of the room . MRS . DOT . [ Looking after him , innocently . ] He is in a temper , isn ’ t he ? It ’ s very hard to please everybody in this life . AUNT ELIZA . You ’ re quite incorrigible . MRS . DOT . Would you mind taking these implements away ? I ’ m really very tired . AUNT ELIZA . I suppose breaking motors is rather hard work . MRS . DOT . And you get very little thanks for it . [ AUNT ELIZA goes out . MRS . DOT sinks into a chair , with a sigh of relief . GERALD comes in . She realises that he is behind her , but pretends not to notice him . He comes up softly . GERALD . Dot ! MRS . DOT . [ Pretending to start . ] Oh , how you frightened me ! You might remember that my nerves are in a very agitated state . GERALD . You asked me a question a little while ago . I can answer it now . MRS . DOT . I ’ m so sorry , I ’ ve quite forgotten what it was . It can ’ t have been of the smallest importance . GERALD . You asked me if I loved you . MRS . DOT . How absurd ! And do you ? GERALD . With all my heart , and I ’ ve loved you passionately from the first moment I saw you . MRS . DOT . With never a day off ? GERALD . With never a day off . I wanted to tell you every minute , and yet I couldn ’ t be such a cad . MRS . DOT . [ Sarcastically . ] It ’ s awfully nice of you to say all this , and I can ’ t tell you how flattered I am . GERALD . Dot ! MRS . DOT . Only it ’ s rather late in the day . I ’ ve promised my hand and heart to James Blenkinsop . GERALD . Fiddle ! MRS . DOT . [ Raising her eyebrows . ] I beg your pardon ? GERALD . [ Firmly . ] Fiddle ! MRS . DOT . Are you under the delusion that because a happy chance has freed you from a previous engagement , I ’ m going to seize the opportunity and leap into your arms ? GERALD . You know , women are brutes . One tries to do the straight thing and behave more or less like a white man , and they make you feel as if you ’ d been an utter beast . MRS . DOT . Do you know why Nellie jilted you ? Because you ’ re a bore . GERALD . [ Smiling . ] I daresay I ’ m very stupid . I suppose that ’ s why I love you so much . MRS . DOT . My dear Gerald , you were cured of your passion for Nellie in a month . I have no doubt that a week in Paris will make your heart whole once more . GERALD . [ Calmly . ] Are you packing me off by any chance ? MRS . DOT . Marked — damaged . GERALD . [ With his tongue in his cheek . ] Then Good-bye ! MRS . DOT . Bon voyage . [ He turns to go and walks slowly to the door . She seizes a cushion and throws it at him , then turns her back on him . He stops , picks up the cushion and gravely brings it to her . GERALD . I think you dropped something . MRS . DOT . [ Gravely . ] Thank you . [ He looks at her , with a smile . She begins to laugh . Suddenly he takes her in his arms . GERALD . You silly little fool .</note>
