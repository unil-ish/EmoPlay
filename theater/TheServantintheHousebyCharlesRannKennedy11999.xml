    <docDate><date>1908</date>TO WALTER HAMPDEN “ There 's a lot o ’ brothers knockin ’ abaht as people do n't know on , eh what ? See wot I mean ? ” “ He that saith he is in the light , and hateth his brother , is in darkness even until now . He that loveth his brother abideth in the light , and there is none occasion of stumbling in him . But he that hateth his brother is in darkness , and walketh in darkness and knoweth not whither he goeth , because that darkness hath blinded his eyes . . . . If a man say , I love God , and hateth his brother , he is a liar : for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen , how can he love God whom he hath not seen ? ”</docDate>

    <p>THE SCENE The scene , which remains unchanged throughout the play , is a room in the vicarage . Jacobean in character , its oak-panelling and beamed-ceiling , together with some fine pieces of antique furniture , lend it an air of historical interest , whilst in all other respects it speaks of solid comfort , refinement , and unostentatious elegance . Evidently the room of a rich man , who has , however , apparently come to some compromise on the difficult question of his entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven ; for the panelled walls possess , among other decorations , a richly ornamented crucifix , a Virgin and Child by an old master , certain saints in ecstasy , and a really remarkable modern oil-painting of the Divine Author of our religion . The main door of the room is at the back of the stage , somewhere towards the middle ; it opens upon a hall , at the further side of which one may perceive , through the open door of another room , a goodly collection of well-bound and learned-looking volumes — the vicar 's library . At the present moment these tomes of wisdom are inaccessible , as the library door is blocked up with unsightly mounds of earth , sewer-pipes , and certain workmen 's implements . The fact is , the vicarage has been greatly disturbed of late , owing to a defect in the drainage — an unsavory circumstance which receives further and regretful explication in the play itself . Returning , then , to the room , one may see , in addition to the main door described above , another door , to the right of stage , and near to the audience . The curious may be glad to learn that this leads into a drawing-room , and incidentally affords one more means of communication with the house . Another exit is provided on the opposite side of the stage [ left ] , where a couple of lofty French windows lead out into the garden . Above the drawing-room door is a fine old Jacobean mantel-piece : a fire burns brightly in the grate . To the left of the main door at the back is a long , low , mullioned window , through which one may see a blue sky , a thatched top or two of cottages , and the gray old tower of the church . Through the French windows are seen a gravel-walk , a lawn , trees , and a sun-dial . Of the essential furniture of the scene , there may be mentioned ; sideboard to right of main door ; table , right-centre of stage , with chairs ; arm-chair by fireplace ; settee , left , towards front ; and a long oak stool in the window . The various properties are described or implied in the text of the play .</p>

     <stage>As the curtain ascends , Rogers and Manson are discovered laying the table for breakfast , the lad being at the upper end of the table , facing the audience , Manson , with his back to the audience , being at the lower end . Rogers is an ordinary little cockney boy in buttons ; Manson is dressed in his native Eastern costume . His face is not seen until the point indicated lower down .</stage>
     <stage>ROGERS [ glancing across curiously ] . Arskin ’ your pardon , Mr. Manson . . . .</stage>
    </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Yes : what is it , Rogers ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROGERS</speaker>
     <p>Funny thing — caw n't get it out of my ‘ ead as I 've knowed you somewhere before . Do n't scarcely seem possible , do it , Mr. Manson ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Many things are possible in this world , Rogers .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROGERS</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>That 's all right ; but ‘ ow long ‘ av ’ you been in England ,</l>
      <l>Mr. Manson ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>I landed late last night , if that 's what you mean .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROGERS</speaker>
     <p>Well , I never been in the continong of Asia , where you come from ; and there you are ! MANSON<stage>quietly</stage>Yes : here I am .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes to the sideboard and busies himself with serviettes , mats , etc .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROGERS</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps it 's this reincarnytion the Daily Mail been writing about . Ever see the Daily Mail out there , Mr. Manson ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>No : we had few advantages .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROGERS</speaker>
     <p>Rum idea , reincarnytion ! Think , Mr. Manson , perhaps we wos lords once in ancient Babylon , you an ’ me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>And now butler and page-boy , eh ? ROGERS<stage>scratching his head</stage>Does seem a bit of a come-down , do n't it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>That 's one way of looking at it .<stage>ROGERS , enticed of Satan , has conveyed a furtive spoonful of jam towards his mouth .</stage><stage>Without turning .</stage>Is n't there jam in the kitchen , Rogers ? ROGERS<stage>scared</stage>Evings ! E 've got eyes in ‘ is boots ! S'y , do you call it stealing , Mr. Manson ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Do you ?<stage>Persisting .</stage>Do you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>ROGERS drops the spoon and moves mournfully away from temptation .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROGERS</speaker>
     <p>‘ Pon my word , Mr. Manson , you give me the fair creeps and no mistike !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>You will get over that when you knew me better .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROGERS</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Manson ! Do you mind if I arst you a question ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>No ; what is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROGERS</speaker>
     <p>What d'you wear them togs for ? This ai n't India .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>People do n't always recognise me in anything else .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He turns for the first time . His face is one of awful sweetness , dignity , and strength . There is the calm of a great mastery about him , suited to his habit as a servant .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROGERS</speaker>
     <p>Garn , Mr. Manson , that 's a bit orf ! Clothes do n't make all that difference , come now ! . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>They are the only things the people of this world see . ROGERS<stage>after a pause</stage>Excuse me , Mr. Manson , you mek me larf .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>That 's all right , Rogers . I have a sense of humour myself , or I should n't be here . ROGERS<stage>suddenly sentimental</stage>Talking about clothes , Mr. Manson , I often thinks in my ‘ ead as I 'd like to be a church clergyman , like master . Them strite-up collars are very becoming . Would n't you , Mr. Manson ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Would n't that be rather presuming , Rogers ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROGERS</speaker>
     <p>Do n't you mek no mistike about it ! ‘ Ere !<stage>He grows confidential .</stage>You are a butler , ai n't you ? Ai n't you , now ? . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Something like that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROGERS</speaker>
     <p>Well , perhaps master ‘ as n't allus been as ‘ igh — See ! O ’ course , I do n't know , but they do s'y as ‘ e was once only a . . . Wot oh ! ‘ Ere ‘ e is !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The VICAR 'S voice is heard off .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>I shall be in to breakfast at a quarter to nine . Do n't wait for me , dearest .<stage>He enters hurriedly from door , right , watch in hand . He has on his cassock and biretta .</stage>So awkward — Both my curates down with the whooping-cough ! To-day , too ! Just when I was expecting . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>As he goes up stage , left of table , MANSON comes down , right , with serviettes . The VICAR wheels round slowly , facing him . Observing his astonishment , ROGERS steps forward with explanation .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROGERS</speaker>
     <p>It 's the new butler , sir . Mr. Manson , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Surely , I — I 've seen you somewhere before . MANSON<stage>looking at him</stage>Have you , sir ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Hm ! No , I can n't quite . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROGERS</speaker>
     <p>Beg pardon , sir : getting on for eight .<stage>He hands him a small silver paten upon which there is a piece of bread .</stage>VICAR<stage>Taking it mechanically</stage>Hm ! These mysteries are not always helpful . . . Anyway , I 'm glad to see you , Manson . When did you arrive ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He begins to break the bread into fragments whilst talking .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Early this morning , sir . I should have come sooner ; but I had a little trouble down at the Customs .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Indeed ! How was that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>They said something about the new Alien Act , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Of course , of course . Er . . . You speak English remarkably well .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>I have seen a good deal of the English , one time and another .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>That 's good : it will save a lot of explanation . By-the-bye . . . My old friend in Brindisi , who recommended you , writes that you bore a very excellent character with your late employer in India ; but there was one matter he did n't mention — No doubt you will recognise its importance in a clergyman 's family — He never mentioned your religion .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>I can soon remedy that , sir . My religion is very simple . I love God and all my brothers . VICAR<stage>after a pause</stage>God and your brothers . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir : all of them .<stage>The VICAR stands thoughtful for a moment . He places the paten on the table , beside him .</stage>VICAR<stage>slowly</stage>That is not always so easy , Manson ; but it is my creed , too .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Then — Brother !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Rapt in thought , the VICAR takes his profferred hand mechanically .</stage>
    <stage>MARY enters . She is a slim young girl in her teens , the picture of rosy sweetness and health .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Good-morning , Uncle William ! Oh ! . . . I suppose you 're Manson ? I must say you look simply ripping ! How do you do ? My name 's Mary .<stage>She offers her hand .</stage>MANSON<stage>kissing it</stage>A very dear name , too ! MARY<stage>embarrassed , blurting</stage>We were wondering last night about your religion . I said . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Mary , my child . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>You do n't look like a cannibal . After all , even the devil is n't as black as he 's . . . Oh , I beg your pardon : perhaps I 'm rude .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Yes , indeed you are . Do n't take any notice of our little feather-brain , Manson .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>I say , has uncle told you who 's coming to-day ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Not about Uncle Josh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>T-t-t ! You must n't call your uncle Joshua that ! It is irreverent . He may resent it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>You know , you 'll make me positively dislike him ! Just fancy , Manson , meeting an uncle whom you 've never so much as set eyes on before ! I do n't even know what he looks like .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She is looking MANSON in the face . He returns her gaze curiously .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Then — you have a surprise in store .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>You ought to be awfully interested ! You will , when you hear where he comes from !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>I am — interested .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Then guess who he is !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Guess — when I know already ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Uncle Joshua is n't his only name — do n't you think that ! He 's a very important person , I can tell you ! His name 's on everybody 's lips ! MANSON<stage>dryly</stage>Really !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Ca n't you guess ? . . . Think of the very biggest person you ever heard of in this world !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>In this world : that sounds rather like . . . Does he give free libraries ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>I can n't say I ever heard of that ; but he does things quite as wonderful ! Listen ! What do you think of the BISHOP OF BENARES ! ! MANSON<stage>unimpressed</stage>Oh , it 's the — Bishop of Benares , is it ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>I must say , you do n't seem very surprised ! Surely you 've heard of him ? He comes from India . MANSON<stage>quietly</stage>I happen to know him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>No , really : this is most interesting !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>As a man might know his own soul , sir — As they say in</l>
      <l>India . His work has been mine , so to speak .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Bless me , you will know him better than I do . I have never seen him since I was quite a little lad . MARY<stage>with prodigious solemnity</stage>Just you think , Manson ! He 's my uncle — my own father 's brother !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MANSON is now up stage between the two .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Your brother , sir ? VICAR<stage>fervently</stage>I am grateful to God for it , Manson : he is .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MANSON regards him calmly for a moment : then he turns inquiringly towards Mary .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Then — Miss Mary ? . . . VICAR<stage>quickly</stage>Oh , my niece is the daughter of — of my other brother .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>I see : two brothers ? VICAR<stage>shortly</stage>Yes , yes , I have : I — I had . MANSON<stage>resuming his work at the table</stage>Thank you , sir : it 's always helpful , coming to a new place , to know who are — and who are not — the family connections .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Come , Rogers ! My poor brethren in the church are waiting . I must see to their necessities at once .<stage>He starts for the door .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Pardon me , sir .<stage>He hands him the bread which , among those necessities , he has forgotten . The VICAR looks at him a moment in troubled thought , and then goes out , followed by ROGERS .</stage>ROGERS<stage>at door</stage>I 'll be back to ‘ elp you in with the breakfast , Mr. Manson .<stage>Exit .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Now , Manson : let 's talk ! You 've got nothing more to do ? . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Not till breakfast .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Then come over here , and make ourselves comfy .<stage>They go over to the settee : she plumps herself down , gathering her legs up into a little bunch . He seats himself beside her .</stage>Now ! Tell me everything you know about the Bishop of Benares !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>What — Uncle Josh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Ssh — ssh — ssh ! That 's naughty , you know ! You heard what Uncle William said ! . . . Do you think he 'd very much mind if I called him Uncle Josh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>You may take it from me , that you may call him whatever you like .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>That 's all very well ; but you 're not Uncle Joshua !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>No ? . . . MARY<stage>hotly</stage>No , you 're not !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Well , since you 're so certain . . . MARY<stage>with conviction</stage>I 'm perfectly certain he 'll never stand a kid like me cheeking him and calling him names ! Uncle William 's quite right ! . . . And that 's why I 've made up my mind that I sha'n ' t like him , after all !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Indeed , I hope you will !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Do you believe in liking people simply because they 're uncles ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps I 'm a prejudiced person .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>I know exactly what he 'll be — goody-goody , is n't he ? You know — religious , and all that !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>God forbid ! MARY<stage>fearfully</stage>Oh , perhaps he 's the other sort — like auntie 's brother ! He 's a bishop — the Bishop of Lancashire . You see , I 've heard a lot about bishops in my time , and they 're not always quite nice men .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>And what sort is the Bishop of Lancashire ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Well , I do n't think I ought to tell you ; but I once heard</l>
      <l>Uncle William call him a devil !— And he 's a clergyman !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Your Uncle Joshua 's reputation is exactly opposite .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>There is that ; everybody speaks awfully well of him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>I do n't think I would go so far as that : some people blackguard him abominably .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>No !— Who ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>His clergy , chiefly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>His clergy ! They must be dreadfully wicked men !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>No — only blind : perhaps , also , a little deaf . But between the two they manage to make his work very difficult .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Why ? What do they do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>It 's partly what they do not do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I see — lazy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Not precisely — they work : they are not idle ; but they serve other masters .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Such as whom ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>The Bishop of Lancashire . MARY<stage>after a pause</stage>, I always thought he was such a great success out there . The papers have been full of it — of the millions of people who follow him about : they say they almost worship him in some places . What kind of people are they ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Just common people .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>And then , all that talk of die great churches he built out there ! . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Churches ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Yes ; did n't he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>He built one .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>What 's it like ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Those who have seen it say there is nothing like it on earth . MARY<stage>eagerly</stage>Have you seen it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>I was there when he built it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>From the very beginning ? MANSON<stage>solemnly</stage>From the beginning .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MARY pauses before speaking : then she says , slowly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>I hope I shall like him . Is he — is he anything like you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MANSON regards her silently for a moment .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>How is it that you know so little about him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Well , you see , I only heard yesterday .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>I thought you said his name was on everybody 's lips .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>You do n't understand . I mean , I never knew that he had anything to do with me — that he was my father 's brother .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Did n't he know ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Who — father ? Oh , you see , I. . . I do n't know my father . . . . . . Uncle William did n't know anything about it until yesterday .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Hm ! That is strange , too !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>There 's a bit of a mystery about it altogether . Would you like to hear ? It is rather like a fairy-tale .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>It must be . Yes , do go on .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>It was all through Uncle William 's Restoration Fund . You see , our old church is in a perfectly rotten state of decay , and naturally it would take a lot to repair it : so uncle thought of starting a Fund — Yes ! Was n't it clever of him ?— I addressed all the envelopes . Would you believe it , we could n't get a single halfpenny ! Is n't it a shame ?— Such a nice old church , too !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>How was that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>That 's the question ! People have been most rude ! Oh , the letters we have had ! The funny thing is , for all their fault-finding , they none of them agree with each other !— Some say the foundations are all wrong : some do n't like the stained-glass windows ; but if you ask me . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Yes , what do you think ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Well , uncle wo n't hear of it ; but I can n't help thinking old</l>
      <l>Bletchley is right . . .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Who 's he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , he 's a dreadfully wicked man , I know that — He 's the quack doctor in the village : he 's — he 's an atheist ! . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Well , what does he think is the matter ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>He says it 's the DRAIN !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>The — the drain ? . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Um ! You know , in spite of what uncle says , there is a smell : I had it in my nose all last Sunday morning . Up in the choir it 's bad enough , and round by the pulpit — Ugh ! I can n't think how uncle stands it ! That 's why the people wo n't come to church — They say so : they stand in the market-place listening to old Bletchley , instead of listening to uncle and trying to be good . The odd thing Is , it must be that very same drain that 's causing the trouble in uncle 's study — That 's his study out there , where they 've been digging : it 's where he writes his sermons . You know , I 've noticed the smell for some time , but uncle got so cross whenever I mentioned it , that I learned to hold my tongue . At last , auntie smelt it , too , and that soon brought the men in ! Ugh ! Perhaps you 've . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>I have ! But what has all this to do with . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Do n't get impatient : it 's all part of the story . . . . Well , we thought we should have poor dear Uncle William perfectly ill . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Because of the drain ? . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>No , because of the Fund . He tried everything : all his rich friends , bazaars , jumble-sales , special intercessions — everything ! And nothing seemed to come of it ! Then at last , yesterday morning , he was reading the newspaper , and there was a long piece about the Bishop of Benares . Uncle read it aloud to us . Suddenly , in the middle , he broke off and said : Look at the power this chap seems to have at the back of him ! I wish to God I had some of it ! He had scarcely said it , when there was a rat-tat at the door : it was the postman ; and what do you think ? IT WAS A LETTER FROM THE BISHOP OF BENARES ? MANSON<stage>anticipating the critics</stage>What a coincidence !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Is n't that wonderful ? Is n't it just like a fairy-tale ? Wait a bit . There 's more yet . . . Here 's the letter : uncle gave it me for my autographs . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She fishes it out from her pocket . MANSON reads it aloud , slowly and clearly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>“ I shall be with you during to-morrow morning . If any one will help me , I will restore your church . Your brother , Joshua . ” MARY<stage>pointing</stage>And there , do you see , underneath , in brackets : The Bishop of Benares .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Dear me , dear me , just those few words !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Was n't it like an answer to prayer ? Auntie saw that at once ! And the odd part about it is , that Uncle William did have a brother Joshua who went away and got lost in India years and years ago ! And to think that he was who he was all the time ! To think of him never writing until yesterday ! To think that before the day is out he will be sitting down here , perhaps in this very place , just like . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She breaks off suddenly , gazing at him ; for his eyes have taken a strange fire .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Just like I am now . . . MARY<stage>falteringly</stage>Yes . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Talking to you . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Oh ! . . .</l>
      <stage>She rises , afraid .</stage>
      <l>MANSON</l>
      <stage>softly</stage>
      <l>, Mary . . .</l>
      <l>MARY</l>
      <stage>in a whisper</stage>
      <l>Who are you ? . . .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>I am . . .<stage>He is interrupted by the great bell of the church , which tolls the Sanctus . After the third stroke , he continues .</stage>I am the servant in this house . I have my work to do . Would you like to help me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>What shall I do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Help to spin she fairy-tale . Will you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>I will .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Then keep the secret — Remember ! And wish hard .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Do you believe in wishing ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Everything comes true , if you wish hard enough .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>What shall I wish for ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>What have you needed most ? What have you not had ? Think it out .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Enter AUNTIE in a negligee morning gown . She has a preoccupied air . She carries her husband 's coat over her arm .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I heard you had arrived . I hope they gave you something to eat when you came in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Thank you , ma'am : it will do later .</p>

     <p>Mary . . . Dearest . . .</p>

     <p>Oh , I beg your pardon , auntie dear , I . . .</p>

     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Dreaming again !<stage>Putting her arm round her .</stage>Come , I want you to put your uncle 's coat by the fire . He will be cold , coming out of that draughty church . MARY<stage>hugging her</stage>You darling ! I believe you think of nobody but uncle in the world !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>And you , sweetheart : you come next — a very near next ! Now , run along .<stage>MARY takes the coat to the fire .</stage><stage>Surveying the table</stage>That 's very nice , Manson , very nice indeed ! Perhaps , just a little further this way . . . .<stage>Removes flowers .</stage>My husband is so fond of them . Ye-es ; and I wanted things particularly nice this morning . . . MARY<stage>at the fire , looking up</stage>I thought you said you — you did n't expect him till twelve-thirty ! . . . AUNTIE<stage>absorbed</stage>Whom ? MARY<stage>chuckling</stage>The — the Bishop of Benares .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>The — the . . . Oh , it 's your uncle I am . . .<stage>To Manson</stage>By-the-bye , has the postman been yet ? MANSON<stage>at the window</stage>I can see him coming up the lane . He 's stopped at the next house .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , then , Mary : will you very much mind if you do n't have breakfast with us this morning ? I want to have a private talk with your uncle .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , auntie , dear ! . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Do n't think of yourself , dear — Remember , there are other people in the world besides you . Go down into the village , and have breakfast with poor old Grannie Durden . Take her some nice new-laid eggs and a pat of butter — Poor soul , it would be a charity !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , auntie , she 's as deaf as a post !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Dearest !— Remember what your uncle said last Sunday about Pure religion and undefiled ! He mentioned Mrs. Durden only a week ago ; but I forgot . Now , run along . MARY<stage>reluctantly</stage>Very well , auntie .<stage>She goes out by the main door .</stage>AUNTIE<stage>laughing</stage>Inconsiderate little monkey ! I am glad you have not thought of changing your pretty , native costume , Manson . It is very picturesque ; and , besides , to-day there is a special reason why it may be considered complimentary .<stage>A double knock is heard at the outer door .</stage>Ah ! Quick , Manson ! The postman !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MANSON goes out . AUNTIE takes a look at the coat : rearranges the flowers , humming , meanwhile , “ The Church 's One Foundation ” ; and then stands impatiently awaiting MANSON 'S reappearance . Presently he returns with a letter on server .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>A letter for you , ma'am .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Ah ! What I expected !<stage>She breaks open the letter and reads it eagerly .</stage>Excellent !<stage>More dubiously</stage>Excellent . . . Manson , we shall have to be very busy to-day . There will be quite a Church Congress to lunch — two bishops !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Oh , not as bad as that , ma'am !</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Manson !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Beg pardon , ma'am ; but master mentioned only one — his brother , the Bishop of Benares .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>My brother will join us also — the Bishop of Lancashire . This is his letter . And now let 's have breakfast , at once . The vicar is sure to be earlier than he said ; and I 'm hungry .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MANSON goes to the door . As he opens it , the VICAR and ROGERS reappear .</stage>
    <sp>

     <p>Here is master . I 'll hurry up the breakfast , ma'am . VICAR<stage>entering</stage>Do , Manson . Let 's get it over .<stage>MANSON goes out .</stage>Excuse me , my dear .<stage>ROGERS helps him off with the cassock .</stage>So tiresome ! Not a place in the house to do anything ! Confound the drains ! Just run up-stairs for my coat , Rogers .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>It 's here , dear . I have it warming for you . VICAR<stage>more graciously</stage>Oh , thank you , Martha . That will do , then , Rogers . Tell Manson to hurry up .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>ROGERS helps him on and goes out . The cassock is left lying on the long stool by the window .</stage>
    <stage>The VICAR crosses moodily to the fireplace . AUNTIE stands undecided , watching him , the letter in her hand .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>You 're back early , dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>What can you expect ? Not a soul there , of course !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>My poor William ! I 'm glad I thought to hurry up the breakfast .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Thanks , dear . You are always thoughtful .</p>

      <l>William . . .</l>
      <stage>He looks up .</stage>
      <l>I — I want to have a little talk with you .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>What is it ? Any more — worry ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>You need n't make it so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Ah ! AUNTIE<stage>moving over to him and stroking his hair</stage>My dearest is not well .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>I think you are right , Martha . I am not well . AUNTIE<stage>alarmed</stage>Not the trouble with your heart again ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>No ; I fancy it goes deeper than that !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>William ! What do you mean ? VICAR<stage>suddenly facing her</stage>Martha ! Do you know the sort of man you have been living with all these years ? Do you see through me ? Do you know me ?— No : do n't speak : I see your answer already — Your own love blinds you ! Ha ! I am a good man !— I do n't drink , I do n't swear , I am respectable , I do n't blaspheme like Bletchley ! Oh yes , and I am a scholar : I can cackle in Greek : I can wrangle about God 's name : I know Latin and Hebrew and all the cursed little pedantries of my trade ! But do you know what I am ? Do you know what your husband is in the sight of God ? He is a LIAR !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>William !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>A liar ! I heard it in my ears as I stood up before Christ 's altar in the church this morning , reciting my miserable creed ! I heard it in my prayers ! I heard it whilst I tasted . . . whilst I drank . . . whilst I . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He sinks into a chair , and buries his face in his hands .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , you are ill ! VICAR<stage>breaking down</stage>O wretched man that I am ! Who shall deliver me out of the body of this death ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She stands above him , hesitating . After a moment , she says , determinedly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>I know : it 's this money trouble . It 's what Joshua said in his letter about your having to get somebody to help him . Well , that 's just what I wanted to speak to you about . I have a way out of the difficulty .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>It 's not the church . I could wish every Stone of it were crumbled into dust !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>William , how wicked of you ! . . . Is it — is it anything to do with your brother Joshua ? Why do n't you answer ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>It has to do with my brother — Robert .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Mary 's fa . . . William , did you send him that telegram yesterday ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Yes : that was a lie , too !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Nonsense ! Do n't be absurd !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>It was a lie !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>You told him we could n't do with him because the house was upset : that 's true ! You told him that the drains were up in the study : that 's true !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Was that the real reason why we refused to have him here ? Was it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>I can n't think what possessed him to write and say he 'd come . We 've not heard from him for fifteen years !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Whose fault is that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Why , his own , of course ! He can n't expect to be treated decently !<stage>She walks up and down with anger .</stage>It 's perfectly absurd , it really is , dear , making all this fuss and trouble about a wretched — Have you told Mary ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>No : the silent lie was comparatively easy !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>My dear , do try and be reasonable . Think of what he is !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Is n't he my brother ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>No , he 's not your brother — at least , nothing that a brother ought to be ! Ridicules everything that you hold sacred ! Hates everything you love ! Loves everything you hate ! . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>That 's true !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>A scoffer , an atheist , a miserable drunkard !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>That was fifteen years ago , remember , after Mary 's mother died ! . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>A man like that never changes ! What would have become of that poor child if we had n't stepped in ? Have you ever dared to tell her what her father 's like ? Of course not ! To-day , too , of all days ! It 's utterly preposterous !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>That is all the more reason why . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>My dear , think of his occupation !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>I think the child ought to be told .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Of his occupation ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>That , and everything .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>My dear , have you gone perfectly mad ? Do you know who 's coming ? Do you want to advertise his occupation to all the world ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Do you think his brother Joshua would mind that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>It is n't only your brother Joshua ! You think of nobody but your brother Joshua ! Some one else is coming .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Who ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>My brother James !<stage>She throws down the letter .</stage>Now you 've heard it all !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>There is a long silence . Then the VICAR speaks in a low , intense voice of bitter contempt .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Your brother James is coming here today ? You have brought him here to help my brother Joshua ! Him !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Why not ? He 's rich ! He can do it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>So , he can recognise me at last !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>It was as much your fault as his , that you have never met ! He naturally resented our marriage . VICAR<stage>ironically</stage>But , of course , now that I 'm related to the great and wealthy Bishop of Benares ... AUNTIE<stage>warmly</stage>He 's as much a bishop as your brother is !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>He ! That gaitered snob !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>William , how dare you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Yes , he 's a bishop ! A bishop of stocks and shares ! A bishop of the counting-house ! A bishop of Mammon !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>William !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>The devil 's own bishop !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>At least , he is n't a WORKING-MAN ! VICAR<stage>as though stung</stage>Ah ! . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They stand below the table , one on either side , tense with passion . They remain so .</stage>
    <stage>MANSON and ROGERS come in with the breakfast . ROGERS goes out immediately .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Sorry to have delayed , sir ; but you said a quarter to nine , did n't you , sir ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Breakfasts served , ma'am . It 's served , sir .<stage>They move to the table , absently , first one , then the other , as he goes to each separately .</stage><stage>MANSON serves them in silence for a few moments .</stage>Beg pardon , sir : what time did you expect the Bishop of Benares ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Oh !— During the morning , he said . That will mean the twelve-thirty , I suppose . It 's the only convenient service .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>And the Bishop of Lancashire , ma'am ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>He did n't say ; but I think we may expect him by the same train . He would scarcely think of catching the . . .<stage>There is heard a loud Ringing of the Bell — a bishop at the very least . All three heads turn automatically .</stage>Good gracious ! Already !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>It does n't sound like the Bishop of Benares , ma'am . He generally comes very quietly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Quick !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Yes , ma'am .<stage>He goes out by the main door .</stage>AUNTIE<stage>rapidly</stage>, William , I 'm sorry ! Really , I did n't mean you : I never thought of you ; I was only thinking of Robert . I only think of you as a great scholar and a saint — yes , you are one !— and as the man I love ! I would sacrifice everything to your happiness . Robert 's nothing to me ; that 's why I . . . Think of what it might mean to Mary — we must think of others , William !— our own little child , as we try to imagine . . .<stage>The VICAR makes a gesture of anguish .</stage>As for James , God knows I did it for the best . I love you , my dear , I love you : I would n't have vexed you for the world ! After all , he is my brother , William ! . . . . I thought of patching up the enmity between you : I thought of all your hopes of rebuilding the church , and James was the only rich man I thought might be induced — under the circumstances . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>I am in the darkness . I do n't know what to do . God has left me stranded .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MANSON re-enters . They look at him inquiringly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>It is n't the Bishop of Benares , ma'am .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Well , who is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>I did n't ask his name , ma'am .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>T-t-t ! How is he dressed ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Rather oddly , ma'am : I noticed that his legs . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>William , it 's James ! I can n't be seen like this . Shew him in . I can slip out this way .<stage>MANSON goes out .</stage>William , try and treat him like . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>How ? Like a brother ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>I was going to say , like a Priest and a Christian , William .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Like a Christian , then .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>My dear !<stage>She goes out by the door to the right , as MANSON begins to turn the handle of the other door .</stage>MANSON<stage>outside</stage>This way , if you please .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The VICAR , braces himself up and turns towards the door with an effort at cordiality .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Just in time for breakfast , my lord .<stage>Enter ROBERT SMITH and MANSON . ROBERT 'S costume is a navvy 's , the knees tied With string .</stage>ROBERT<stage>grimly</stage>Thanks , Bill Awlmighty , do n't mind if I do . My belly 's fair aching .</p>

He pays no heed to MANSON , who stands quite close to him , on the left .</stage>See that blighter ? That 's the bloke as was born with no bowels ! ‘ E might a-made a man o ’ me once , if ‘ e 'd tried ; but ‘ e did n't — ‘ im and ‘ is like . Hm ! Dam foolish , I call it , do n't you ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>Why , then . . . there 's allus my own . I nearly did it once . MANSON<stage>after a pause</stage>How did you come to lose her ? ROBERT<stage>roughly</stage>Never you mind !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>How did you come to lose her ? ROBERT<stage>sullenly</stage>Typhoid fever .<stage>MANSON notes the evasion with a glance . He helps ROBERT to more tea , and waits for him to speak . ROBERT wriggles under his gaze , and at last he says , reluctantly .</stage>Oh , it was my own fault , as I lost the kid !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>That was a sore loss , comrade .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>I know it ! Need n't rub it in ! . . . Look , ‘ ere , comride , I ‘ ad n't a bad nature to begin with . Did n't me an ’ my brother Joshua pinch an ’ slave the skin orf our bones to send that spotted swine to school ? Did n't we ‘ elp ‘ im out with ‘ is books an ’ ‘ is mortar-boards an ’ ‘ is bits of clothes to try an ’ mek ‘ im look respectable ? That 's wot we did , till ‘ e got ‘ is lousy scholyships , an ’ run away to get spliced with that she-male pup of a blood - ‘ ound ! Cos why ? Cos we was proud of the little perisher !— proud of ‘ is ‘ ead-piece ! We ‘ ad n't gone none ourselves — leastways , I ‘ ad n't : Joshua was different to me ; and now . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>And your brother Joshua : what of him ? Where is he now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know — gone to pot , like me ! P'r ' aps eatin ’ is bleedin ’ ‘ eart out , same as I am , at the base ingratitood of the world !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps so !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>Where was I ? You mek me lose my air , shoving in with your bit !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>You were saying that you had n't a bad nature to begin with . ROBERT<stage>truculently</stage>No more I ‘ ad n't ! . . . O ’ course , when she took an ’ — an ’ died , things was different : I could n't ‘ old up the same — Somehow , I do n't know , I lost my ‘ eart , and . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Yes ? . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>That 's ‘ ow I come to lose my kid , my little kid . . . Mind you , that was fifteen years ago : I was a rotter then , same as you might be . I was n't ‘ arf the man I am now . . . You can larf ! A man can change a lot in fifteen years !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>I did n't laugh .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>Do you want to know wot 's come over me since then ? I work — and work well : that 's more than some of ‘ em can say — And I do n't get much money for it , either ! That ought to mek ‘ em feel ashamed ! I 'm not the drunkard I was — not by ‘ arf ! If I 'm bitter , oo 's made me bitter ? You caw n't be very sweet and perlite on eighteen bob a week — when yer get it ! I 'll tell yer summat else : I 've eddicated myself since then — I 'm not the gory fool I was — And they know it ! They can n't come playin ’ the ‘ anky with us , same as they used to ! It 's Nice Mister Working-man This and Nice Mister Working-man That , will yer be so ‘ ighly hobliging as to ‘ and over your dear little voting-paper — you poor , sweet , muddy-nosed old Idiot , as can n't spot your natural enemy when yer see ‘ im ! That orter mek some on ‘ em sit up ! Fifteen years ago me an ’ my like ‘ ad n't got a religion ! By Gawd , we ‘ av ’ one now ! Like to ‘ ear wot it is ?</p>

    </sp>

     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>I believe in fighting with my clarss !</p>

     <p>Oh , leave me alone . I caw n't be allus pickin ’ an ’ choosin ’ my words ! I ai n't no scholar — thank Gawd !</p>

     <p>So I did , not ‘ arf ! Thought if I kicked up an ‘ ell of a shindy they 'd think some big bug was comin ’ ; and then when they 'd be all smiles an ’ bowin ’ an ’ scrapin ’ , in pops me , real low !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>ROGERS enters . On seeing them at the table , he is apparently troubled with his inside .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROGERS</speaker>
     <p>Oh , my ‘ oly Evings !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Who is it , Rogers ? ROGERS<stage>awed</stage>It 's the Bishop of Lancashire ! MANSON<stage>imperturbably</stage>Shew him in , Rogers .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROGERS</speaker>
     <p>Beg pardon , Mr. Manson . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>I said , shew him in . Quick , Rogers . Keep a bishop waiting !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>ROGERS</speaker>
     <p>Well , I 'm jiggered !</p>

    <stage>He is ; and goes out .</stage>

     <p>‘ Ere ! Did ‘ e say bishop ?</p>

     <p>Yes .</p>

D ., the Most Reverend the Lord Bishop of Lancashire . He looks his name , his goggles and ear-trumpet lending a beautiful perfection to the resemblance .</stage><stage>MANSON has risen : ROBERT , imperturbable , discusses sossingers : ROGERS , with a last excruciation of his ailment , vanishes .</stage><stage>The Most Reverend Father in God stands blinking for recognition . Pained at the non-fulfilment of this worthy expectation , he moves — a little blindly — towards the table . Here he encounters the oppugnant back of the voracious ROBERT , who grows quite annoyed . Indeed , be as good as says so .</stage>‘ Ere , where ye comin ’ to ? BISHOP<stage>peering closely into his face , the other edging away</stage>Ah ! Mr. Smythe , or I am mistaken .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>My dear sir , do n't mention it : my sister has explained everything . I bear you no grudge — none whatever !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>What 's the silly ole josser jawin ’ abaht now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>But I perceive that I have — er —<stage>sniffing</stage>disturbed you at your morning meal . . . ROBERT<stage>with conviction</stage>You ‘ av ’ that !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>Eh ? . . . ROBERT<stage>louder</stage>I say , you ‘ av ’ ! BISHOP<stage>fixing his ear-trumpet</stage>Just once more . . .</p>

     <p>Oh , Moses !<stage>Roaring , and indicating his breakfast .</stage>You ‘ av ’ blarst you ! BISHOP<stage>mistaking the gesticulation</stage>Thank you , you are very kind . I think I will . I could get nothing on the journey but a cup of coffee and a bun .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He sits at the table without ever having perceived MANSON , who has nevertheless been serving him .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>Yus , you look as if you fed on buns !<stage>Throughout the play the audience will understand where the BISHOP does , and where he does not , hear by his use or non-use of the ear-trumpet . Perhaps the reader will be good enough to imagine these occasions for himself , as he may have observed a reluctance on the part of the author to encumber the text with stage directions .</stage>BISHOP<stage>eating , and at the same time addressing the becassocked ROBERT</stage>And you must not think , on account of the little coolness between us , that I have not followed your career with great interest — very great interest ! Your scholastic achievements have been most praiseworthy — especially under the unfortunate circumstances . . . . Although , by-the-way , I cannot at all agree with your gloss on Romans fourteen , twenty-three ; Katakekritai either means damned or nothing at all . ROBERT<stage>gesticulating</stage>It was ‘ im as said damned !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>No , no , sir : it is perfectly indefensible !</p>

     <p>We had better drop the subject ! . . . Boeotian ! After all , it is not precisely the matter which has brought us together . And that reminds me . . .<stage>Trumpet .</stage>Has he come yet ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>Oo ?</p>

     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>Your brother , of course .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>My brother ! Oh , you 'll see ‘ im soon enough !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>I gather from your remark that he has not arrived yet . Good ! The fact is , I should like a preliminary discussion with yourself before meeting your illustrious brother .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>Then you 'd better look slippy !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>I beg your pardon ? . . . ROBERT<stage>with a flap at the trumpet</stage>Go on : you ‘ eard .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>Of course , the financial undertaking is considerable : it 's not like an investment , where there is some reasonable hope of a return : it 's merely a matter of charity ! The money 's — gone , so to speak .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>Yus , I 've noticed that about money , myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>At the same time , I should like my name to be associated with your brother 's , in so worthy an enterprise . . . ROBERT<stage>mildly sarcastic</stage>You do n't say !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>And then again , I trust — I say I trust — I am not impervious to the more sacred obligations involved ; but . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He gropes blindly for bread .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>I allus notice that sort of ‘ igh talk ends with a “ but ” . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>Naturally , I should like to learn a little , beforehand , of your brother 's views . From what I gather , they are not altogether likely to coincide with my own . Of course , he is an idealist , a dreamer . Now , under these circumstances , perhaps . . . Eh , what — Oh ! Bless my soul !<stage>MANSON has been offering him bread for some time . He has just tumbled to the fact of his presence . He rises .</stage>My — my Brother from Benares , I presume ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>What , my pal , ‘ is brother ! Oh , Je'oshaphat !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>Ten thousand pardons ! Really , my eyesight is deplorable ! Delighted to meet you ! . . . I was just observing to our charming host that — er — Humph ! . . . Bless me ! Now what was I . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Something about your sacred obligations , I believe .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>May I trouble you again ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MANSON gravely fixes the ear-trumpet in his ear .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>That 's right : stick the damned thing in ‘ is ear - ‘ ole , comride ! MANSON<stage>through the trumpet</stage>Your sacred obligations .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>Precisely , precisely ! Er — Shall we sit ?<stage>They do so . The BISHOP looks to MANSON to begin . MANSON , failing him , the spirit begins to work within himself .</stage>Well — er — - speaking of that , of course , my dearly-beloved brother , I feel very seriously on the matter , very seriously — as I am sure you do . The restoration of a church is a tremendous , an overwhelming responsibility . To begin with , it — it costs quite a lot . Does n't it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>It does : quite a lot .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>Hm , yes — yes ! . . . You mentioned Sacred obligations just now , and I think that on the whole I am inclined to agree with you . It is an admirable way of putting it . We must awaken people to a sense of their sacred obligations . This is a work in which everybody can do something : the rich man can give of the abundance with which it has pleased Providence specially to favour him : the poor man with his slender savings need have no fear for the poverty of his gift — Let him give all : it will be accepted . Those of us who , like yourself , my dear brother — and I say it in all modesty , perhaps myself — are in possession of the endowments of learning , of influence , of authority — we can lend our names to the good work . As you say so very beautifully : sacred obligations . By-the-way , I do n't think I quite caught your views as to the probable cost . Eh , what do you think ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>I think that should depend upon the obligations ; and then , of course , the sacredness might count for something .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes , we 've discussed all that . But bringing it down to a practical basis : how much could we manage with ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>What do you say to — everything you have ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>My dear sir , I 'm not talking about myself !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Well — everything the others have ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>My dear sir , they 're not fools ! Do discuss the matter like a man of the world !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>God 's not watching : let 's give as little , and grab as much as we can !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>Ssh ! My dear brother ! Remember who 's present !<stage>He glances toward Robert .</stage>However . . .<stage>Coughs .</stage>We will return to this later . I begin to understand you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>Yus : you think you do !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>At the same time , I do think we ought to come to some general understanding ; we must count the cost . Now , from all accounts , you have had some experience of church-building out in India — not that I think the extravagance for which you are credited would be either possible or desirable in this country — oh , no ! Thank God , we know how to worship in spirit and in truth , without the aid of expensive buildings ! However , I should like to hear your views . How did you manage it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Sacrifice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>Of course , of course ; but practically . They say it 's an enormous concern !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>So it is .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>Well , what would such an establishment as that represent ? In round numbers , now ? MANSON<stage>calmly</stage>Numberless millions .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>Numberless mil . . . !<stage>He drops his fork .</stage>My dear sir , absurd ! . . . Why , the place must be a palace — fit for a king !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>It is !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>Do you mean to tell me that one man alone , on his own naked credit , could obtain numberless millions for such an object as that ? How could you possibly get them together ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>They came freely from every quarter of the world .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>On the security of your own name alone ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>No other , I assure you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>For Heaven 's sake , tell me all about it ! What sort of a place is it ? MANSON<stage>seriously</stage>Are you quite sure you can hear ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps your voice is not quite so clear as it was . However . . .<stage>He wipes the inside of the ear-trumpet , and fixes it afresh .</stage>Now ! Tell me about your church .<stage>During the following speech the BISHOP is occupied with his own thoughts : after the first few words he makes no attempt at listening : indeed , the trumpet goes down to the table again in no time . On the other hand , ROBERT , at first apathetic , gradually awakens to the keenest interest in what MANSON says .</stage>MANSON<stage>very simply</stage>I am afraid you may not consider it an altogether substantial concern . It has to be seen in a certain way , under certain conditions . Some people never see it at all . You must understand , this is no dead pile of stones and unmeaning timber . It is a living thing . BISHOP<stage>in a hoarse whisper , self-engrossed</stage>Numberless millions !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>When you enter it you hear a sound — a sound as of some mighty poem chanted . Listen long enough , and you will learn that it is made up of the beating of human hearts , of the nameless music of men 's souls — that is , if you have ears . If you have eyes , you will presently see the church itself — a looming mystery of many shapes and shadows , leaping sheer from floor to dome . The work of no ordinary builder ! BISHOP<stage>trumpet down</stage>On the security of one man 's name !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>The pillars of it go up like the brawny trunks of heroes : the sweet human flesh of men and women is moulded about its bulwarks , strong , impregnable : the faces of little children laugh out from every corner-stone : the terrible spans and arches of it are the joined hands of comrades ; and up in the heights and spaces there are inscribed the numberless musings of all the dreamers of the world . It is yet building — building and built upon . Sometimes the work goes forward in deep darkness : sometimes in blinding light : now beneath the burden of unutterable anguish : now to the tune of a great laughter and heroic shoutings like the cry of thunder .<stage>Softer .</stage>Sometimes , in the silence of the night-time , one may hear the tiny hammerings of the comrades at work up in the dome — the comrades that have climbed ahead .<stage>There is a short silence , broken only by the champing jaws of the BISHOP , who has resumed his sausages . ROBERT speaks first .</stage>ROBERT<stage>slowly</stage>I think I begin to understand you , comride : especially that bit abaht . . .<stage>his eyes stray upwards</stage>the ‘ ammerins ’ an ’ the — the harches — an ’ . . . Humph ! I 'm only an ‘ og ! . . . S'pose there 's no drain ‘ ands wanted in that there church o ’ yours ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Drains are a very important question there at present .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>Why , I 'd be cussin ’ over every stinkin ’ pipe I laid .</p>

     <p>I should make that a condition , comrade . ROBERT<stage>rising , he pulls off the cassock ; goes to fire for his coat : returns : drags it on</stage>I do n't know ! Things ‘ av ’ got in a bit of a muck with me ! I 'm rather like a drain-pipe myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>With sudden inspiration ] . There 's one thing I can do !</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>What 's that ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>Renahnce ole Beelzebub an ’ all ‘ is bloomin ’ wirks ! ‘ And us that brarss-band !<stage>He alludes to the ear-trumpet . MANSON obeying , ROBERT jabs it into the ear of the BISHOP , who seems quite surprised .</stage>‘ Ere ! ‘ Av ’ you ever ‘ eard of ‘ ell ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>

     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>Well , my dear sir , I think I ought to !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>Then , go there ! Aymen . . . Now I 'll go an ’ ‘ av ’ a look at our Bill 's drains , damn ‘ is eyes !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out through the main door , repentant .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>The scoundrel ! Did you hear what he said ? I shall certainly report him to his bishop !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>I do n't think I should . His bishop does n't mind a little plain speech now and again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>A little plain speech ! Do you think it 's right for a clergyman to — to direct me to perdition ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>I think you are making a mistake : the man who gave you your — direction is not a clergyman . He 's a scavenger .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>A scavenger !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Yes — looks after drains .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>Do you mean to tell me that I 've been sitting down to breakfast with a common working-man ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Yes ; have you never done that before ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>My dear sir , whatever do you take me for ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>A bishop of God 's church .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>Precisely ! Is it your custom to breakfast with working-men ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Every morning . You see , I 'm prejudiced : I was one myself , once .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>You ? . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Yes — a long time ago , though : people have forgotten .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>But , my dear brother , I am perfectly sure you never told people to go to . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Oh yes , quite frequently : it would shock you to learn the language I really did use . Perhaps , under the circumstances , it might be advisable to drop the subject at this point . BISHOP<stage>emphatically</stage>I most certainly agree with you there ! After all , it is a digression from the purpose for which we are here ! . . . Let me see , then : where were we ? . . . Oh yes , I remember — Although , by the way , it was very ill-advised of you to speak your mind so openly in that man 's presence ! However . . . To resume our — how shall I call it ?— our — little understanding , eh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>That describes it most accurately .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>Now , you said , Let 's give as little , and grab as much as we can . Of course , that is a playful way of putting it ; but between ourselves , it expresses my sentiments exactly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>I knew that when I said it . BISHOP<stage>delighted</stage>My dear brother , your comprehension makes my heart warm . I trust our relations may always remain as warm .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Oh , warmer , warmer !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>Very well then , to business ! I tell you , candidly , I agree with you , that there is no necessity for sinking anything of our own in the concern : nothing ever comes of that sort of reckless generosity ! If people want a church , let them make some sacrifice for it ! Why should we do anything ? I am sure you will appreciate my candour ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>At its full value . Go on .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>At the same time , there is no reason why we should throw cold water upon the project . On the contrary , we might promote it , encourage it , even lend it the influence of our patronage and our names . But on one understanding !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>And that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>That it is extended — imperialised , so to speak : that it is made the vehicle of a much vaster , of a much more momentous project behind it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>You interest me intensely . Explain .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>I will .<stage>He looks around to assure himself that they are alone .</stage>There is in existence a society , a very influential society , in which I happen to have an interest — very great interest . Hm ! I am one of the directors . I may say that it is already very well established , financially ; but it is always open to consider the — extension of its influence in that way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>And the name of the society ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Rather long , but I trust explicit . It is called “ The</l>
      <l>Society for the Promotion and Preservation of Emoluments for the</l>
      <l>Higher Clergy . ”</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>I do not seem to have heard it named before .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>Well , no : its movements have always been characterised by a certain modesty . It is an invisible society , so to speak ; but I can assure you its principles are very clearly understood — among the parties most concerned .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>And your project ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Affiliate the subsidiary question of the building of the</l>
      <l>Church , with the larger interests of the Society .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Yes , but since people have already refused to subscribe to the more trivial project . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>They have not been properly approached . My dear sir , in order to awaken public generosity , It is necessary to act like men of the world : we must have names . People will subscribe to any amount , if you can only get the right names . That Is where you come in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>I ! Do you propose to place my name at the head of your — prospectus ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>My dear sir , invaluable ! Did n't you say yourself that you brought in numberless millions , on your own credit , out there in India ? Why should n't you do the same in England ? Think of your reputation , your achievements , your name for sanctity — Not a word , sir : I mean it ! . . . Why , there 's no end to the amount it would bring in : it would mean billions ! Well , what do you say ? MAMSON<stage>slowly</stage>Let us clearly understand one another . I am to lend you my name — just my name — and you are to do all the rest . BISHOP<stage>quickly</stage>Oh yes : I 'd rather you kept out of the business negotiations !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>It is rather a dangerous name to play with ! BISHOP , I take that responsibility entirely upon myself !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>And when all 's over and done with , what are we going to gain out of the transaction ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>We shall have to come to some private settlement between ourselves .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>When ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>Oh , hereafter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Hereafter , then .<stage>Enter AUNTIE and VICAR by door to right .</stage>AUNTIE<stage>off</stage>Leave him to me , William ! I 'll soon settle the matter !<stage>Entering .</stage>The man must be possessed of some evil spirit ! . . . Why — it 's my brother James ! . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MANSON has risen , and is now the butler once more . He speaks into the ear-trumpet .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Your sister and the vicar , my lord . BISHOP<stage>behind table , rising</stage>Ah ! Well , Martha !— No , no , no , if you please !<stage>He restrains her approach .</stage>Observe the retribution of an unchastened will . You have never seen my face for sixteen years ! However , like a cloud , I blot out your transgressions from this hour ! And so this is your husband ?— Not a word , sir ; not a single word !— the sausages were delicious , and your place has been most agreeably occupied by your brother !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>My brother ! Then you . . . What do you mean ? BISHOP<stage>testily</stage>I mean what I say , sir ! Your brother , my brother , our brother here , of course , our Oriental brother !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>James , you are making a mistake : this is our new butler — our Indian butler .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>Your Indian — WHAT ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He stands cogitating horribly until the end of the act , facing towards MANSON .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>What has made him like this ? He seems possessed !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>He is ! . . . I have just been having some trouble with another devil , ma'am .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Meaning , of course . . . What has become of him ? MANSON<stage>with his eye</stage>He is cast out forever .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Where is he now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>He walks through dry places seeking —<stage>he probes her soul</stage>— other habitations .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Manson ! This is your doing ! Oh , you have saved us !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>I am trying to , ma'am ; but , God knows , you make it rather difficult !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>A change comes over her face , as the curtain slowly falls .</stage>

    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>As the curtain rises , the scene and situation remain unchanged ; but attention now centres in the Bishop , who appears to be struggling apoplectically for speech .</stage>
     <stage>BISHOP [ bursting ] . Before we proceed a step further , I have a most extraordinary request to make ! The fact is , you interrupted me in the middle of a most engrossing spiritual discussion with my . . . that is to say , with your . . . in short , with that person standing over there ! My request is , that I be permitted a few minutes further conversation with him — alone , and at once !</stage>

    <sp>
     <speaker>ALL</speaker>
     <p>) With Manson ! . . . MANSON . ) With me ! . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>Not a word ! I know my request will appear singular — most singular ! But I assure you it is most necessary . The peace , the security of a human soul depends upon it ! Come , sir ! Where shall we go ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Have I your permission , ma'am</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Certainly ; but it is most extraordinary ! MANSON<stage>crossing</stage>Then I think this way , my lord , in the drawing-room . . .<stage>He leads the way .</stage>BISHOP<stage>following</stage>And you may be sure , my good fellow , I will give anything — I say , anything — to remedy your misapprehensions ! Hm !</p>

     <p>Martha ! It 's no use ! I can n't do it ! AUNTIE<stage>preoccupied</stage>Ca n't do what , William ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Behave towards that man like a Christian ! He stirs some nameless devil like murder in my heart ! I want to clutch him by the throat , as I would some noisome beast , and strangle him ! AUNTIE<stage>slowly</stage>He is greatly changed !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>It is you who have changed , Martha . You see him now with different eyes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Do I ? I wonder ! . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>After all , why should we invite him here ? Why should we be civil to him ? What possible kinship can there be between us ? As for his filthy money — how did he scrape it together ? How did he come by it ? . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , William , that 's true , but the opportunity of turning it to God 's service . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Do you think any blessing is going to fall upon a church whose every stone is reeking with the bloody sweat and anguish of the human creatures whom the wealth of men like that has driven to despair ? Shall we base God 's altar in the bones of harlots , plaster it up with the slime of sweating-dens and slums , give it over for a gaming-table to the dice of gamblers and of thieves ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Why will you exaggerate , my dear ?— It is not as bad as that . Why do n't you compose yourself and try and be contented and — and happy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>How can I be happy , and that man poisoning the air I breathe ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>You are not always like this , dear ! . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Happy ! How can I be happy , and my brother Robert what I have made him !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>We are not talking of Robert : we are talking of you ! Think of our love , William — our great and beautiful love ! Is n't that something to make you happy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Our love ? It 's well you mention it . That question had better be faced , too ! Our love ! Well , what of it ? What is love ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , William , you know . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Is love a murderer ? Does love go roaming about the world like Satan , to slay men 's souls ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , now you 're exaggerating again ! What do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>I mean my brother Robert ! What has love done for him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Robert , Robert — I 'm sick to death of Robert ! Why can n't you think of yourself ?</p>

     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Well , I will ! What has love done for me ?</p>

    </sp>
    <stage>The slightest pause . The scene takes on another complexion .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Do you remember that day when I first came to you and told you of my love ? Did I lie to you ? Did I try to hide things ? Did I despise my birth ? Did you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>No , no , William , I loved you : I told you so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Did you mind the severance from your family because of me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Did n't I always say that I was proud to be able to give up so much for you , William ? . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Yes , and then what followed ? Having given up so much for me , what followed ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>My dear , circumstances were too strong for us ! Ca n't you see ? You were not made to live out your life in any little odd hole and corner of the world ! There was your reputation , your fame : you began to be known as an author , a scholar , a wonderful preacher — All this required position , influence , social prestige . You do n't think I was ambitious for myself : it was for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>For me — yes ! And how do you imagine I have benefited by all your scheming , your contriving , your compromising , your . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>In the way I willed ! I am glad of it ! I worked for that — and I won ! . . . Well , what are you troubling about now ? VICAR<stage>slowly</stage>I am thinking of the fact that there has been no child to bless our marriage , Martha — that is , no child of our very own , no child whose love we have not stolen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>My dear . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>We have spoken about it sometimes , have n't we ? Or , rather — not spoken !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>William , why will you think of these things ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>In those first days , dearest , I brought you two children of our own to cherish , little unborn souls crying for you to mother them — You have fostered only the one . That one is called the Scholar . Shall I tell you the name of the other ? AUNTIE<stage>after a moment</stage>Yes . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>I hardly know : I hardly dare to name him , but perhaps it was — the Saint .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>What I have done , William , has been done for love of you — you only — you only in the world !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Yes : that 's what I mean !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The thought troubles her for a moment ; then she paces up and down in agitated rebellion .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>No ! I can n't believe it ! I can n't think that love is as wrong as you say !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Love is a spirit of many shapes and shadows : a spirit of fire and darkness — a minister of heaven and hell : Sometimes I think the very damned know love — in a way . It can inform men 's souls with the gladness of high archangels , or possess them with the despair of devils !<stage>She suddenly stands still , struck by the echo in his last phrase .</stage>Yes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>I was wondering . . . Wondering what Manson meant just now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>When ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>When he spoke about your brother Robert .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>I think he made it clear . He said we were — rid of him forever ! AUNTIE<stage>thoughtfully</stage>Ye-es . . . William , I begin to fear that man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Whom — Robert ?</p>

     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>His lordship will be glad to see you .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>A remedy for misapprehension , ma'am .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>It 's a five-pound note .</p>

     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know : God help me , I can n't see the way !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They both go out , MANSON watching them . He then moves up to the fire , and burns the five-pound note . He watches the flames leap up as he speaks .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Thou givest thy mouth to evil , and thy tongue frameth deceit . Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother : thou slanderest thine own mother 's son . These things hast thou done , and I kept silence : thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself : but I will reprove thee , and set them in order before thine eyes .<stage>Footnote : Psalms 1 . 19-21</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He comes down to the middle of the room . MARY enters eagerly . Seeing him alone , she gives a little cry of gladness .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , how jolly ! Where are they ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Ah ! AH !</p>

    <stage>She comes to his out-stretched arms . He folds her to his heart , facing the audience .</stage>
    <stage>Looking up into his face . ] Is n't it a great secret ? What shall I call you , now we are alone ?</stage>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Yes . Let me help you .<stage>MANSON having rung the bell , they begin to remove the breakfast things . MARY employs herself with the crumb-scoop .</stage>If auntie and uncle could see me now ! If they only knew ! I 've kept the secret : I 've told nobody ! . . . These will do for the birds . Look , I 'll take them now .<stage>She throws the crumbs out of the French windows .</stage>Poor little mites !<stage>She returns to the table .</stage></p>

    <stage>ROGERS enters whilst he gives this command .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROGERS</speaker>

    <sp>
     <speaker>ROGERS</speaker>
     <p>Well , since you arsk me , miss , it 's the goin 's on in this ‘ ouse ! I never see such a complicyted mass of mysteries and improbabilities in my life ! I shall ‘ av ’ to give in my notice !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Rogers , that would be dreadful ! Why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Now the cloth , Mary . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROGERS</speaker>
     <p>Cos why ? That 's why !— What you 're doin ’ now ! I likes people to keep their proper stytion ! I was brought up middle-clarss myself , an ’ taught to be'ave myself before my betters !— No offence to you , Mr. Manson !<stage>He says this with a jib , belying his words .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Nonsense , Rogers ! I like helping .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROGERS</speaker>
     <p>My poor farver taught me . ‘ E led a godly , righteous , an ’ sober life . ‘ E was a grocer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Come , Rogers . Take them to the kitchen .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>ROGERS obeys with some asperity of mien . At the door he delivers a Parthian shot .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROGERS</speaker>
     <p>If my poor farver could see what I 've seen to-day , ‘ e would roll over in ‘ is grave !<stage>MANSON opens the door for him . He goes .</stage>MARY<stage>gayly</stage>Is n't he funny ? Just because his silly old father . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Ssh ! His father 's dead , Mary !</l>
      <stage>There is a sudden pause . He comes down to her .</stage>
      <l>Well , have you thought any more about . . .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>About wishing ?— Yes , lots .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>And have you ? . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know what to think . You see , I never believed properly in wishing before . Wishing is a dreadfully difficult thing , when you really set about it , is n't it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>You see , ordinary things wo n't do : they 're all wrong , somehow . You 'd feel a bit of a sneak to wish for them , would n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Even if you got them , you would n't care , after all . They 'd all turn to dust and ashes in your hand . That last bit is what Grannie Durden said .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Who 's she ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>She 's the poor old woman I 've been having breakfast with . Do you know , she said a funny thing about wishing . I must tell you first that she 's quite blind and very deaf — Well , she 's been wishing ever so long to see and hear ; and at last she says she can !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>What — see and hear ?<stage>He glances towards the drawing-room .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Um ! I must say , I did n't notice any difference myself ; but that 's what she said . She agreed with you , that wishing was the only way ; and if you did n't know how , then you had to keep on wishing to wish , until you could .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>And so . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Well , that 's as far as I 've got .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>ROGERS re-enters .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Yes , what is it , Rogers ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROGERS</speaker>
     <p>Cook 's compliments , Mr. Manson , and might she make so bold as to request your presence in the kitchen , seein ’ as she 's ‘ ad no orders for lunch yet . O ’ course , she says , it will do when you 've quite finished any private business you may ‘ av ’ in the upper part of the ‘ ouse !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He delivers this with distinct hauteur . MANSON , smiling , goes up to him and takes his head in his hands .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Why do you dislike me so , Rogers ? ROGERS<stage>taken aback</stage>Me ? Me dislike you , Mr. Manson ? Oh no !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Come along , little comrade .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They go out like brothers , MANSON 'S arm round the lad 's shoulders .</stage>
    <stage>MARY is left seated on the table , chuckling at the situation . Suddenly her face becomes serious again : she is lost in thought . After a while she speaks softly to herself .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>What have I needed most ? What have I not had ? . . . Oh ! I know ! . . .<stage>Her face flames with the sudden inspiration .</stage>And I never dreamed of it till now !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>ROBERT enters by the main door . The child turns round , and , seeing him , gives a startled little cry . They stand facing each other , silent . Presently ROBERT falters .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>Beg pawdon , miss : I . . .</p>

     <p>If you do , I 'll . . .</p>

    <stage>She moves swiftly to the bell .</stage>

     <p>It 's a mistake , miss . P'r ' aps I 'd — I 'd better tek my ‘ ook .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Yes , you .</p>

      <l>Wot 's that ? . . .</l>
      <l>Do you tike me for a thief , miss ? You ? . . .</l>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>I had rather not say .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>Cos why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>I do n't want to be unkind .<stage>ROBERT sinks stricken into the chair behind him .</stage>ROBERT , Oh , my Gawd , my Gawd ! MARY<stage>relenting</stage>Of course , if — if you 're sorry , that makes a difference . Being sorry makes a lot of difference . Does n't it ?</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Yus , a fat lot !</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>No , I did n't . It was you as jumped down my throat , an ’ took up my words afore I got ‘ em out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Oh : I 'm sorry . Did I make a mistake ?</p>

    </sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>Never you mind ! Summat as impossible as — fairy-tales !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>So 's mine ! That 's what it has to be ! Mine 's the most impossible thing in the world !</p>

     <p>Never you mind . She 's bein ’ looked arfter .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>By whom ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>By people as I 've allus ‘ ated like poison !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Why , are n't they kind to her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>Yus : they 've made ‘ er summat , as I could n't ‘ a ’ done .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Then why do you hate them ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>I do n't any longer . I ‘ ates myself , I ‘ ates the world I live in , I ‘ ates the bloomin ’ muck ‘ ole I 've landed into !</p>

     <p>Your wife 's dead , you say ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>Yus .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>What would she think about it all ? ROBERT<stage>hollowly , without variation</stage>I do n't know : I do n't know : I do n't know .<stage>MARY sits down beside him .</stage>MARY<stage>thoughtfully</stage>Is n't it strange — both our wishes alike ! You want your little girl ; and I , my father !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>What sort of a . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Yes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>What sort of a bloke might your father be , miss ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know . I have never seen him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>Got no idea ? Never — ‘ eard tell of ‘ im ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Never .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>‘ Ave n't thought of ‘ im yourself , I s'pose ? Was n't particular worth while , eh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>It 's not that . I 've been selfish . I never thought anything about him until to-day .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>What made you think of ‘ im — to-day ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>I can n't quite say . At least . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>Mebbe ‘ e wrote — sent a telingram or summat , eh ?— t ’ say as ‘ e was comin ’ ? MARY<stage>quickly</stage>Oh no : he never writes : we never hear from him . That 's perhaps a bit selfish of him , too , is n't it ? ROBERT<stage>after a moment</stage>Looks like it , do n't it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>But I do n't think he can be really selfish , after all . ROBERT<stage>with a ray of brightness</stage>Cos why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Because he must be rather like my Uncle William and Uncle</l>
      <l>Joshua .</l>

    </sp>
    <stage>He looks at her curiously .</stage>
    <sp>

     <p>Like your . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Yes — they 're his brothers , you know . This is Uncle William 's house .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>Yes , but what do you know about . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>About Uncle Joshua ? Well , I happen to know a good deal more than I can say . It 's a secret .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>S'pose your Uncle William spoke to you about ‘ im ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Well , yes . Uncle William spoke about him , too .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>But never about your father ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Oh no , never .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>Why , miss ? MARY<stage>slowly</stage>I — do n't — know .</p>

     <p>P'r ' aps ‘ e ai n't — good enough — to be — to be the brother of your Uncle William — and — Uncle — Joshua — eh , miss ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I can n't think that !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>Why not , miss ? Three good brothers in a family do n't scarcely seem possible — not as families go — do they , miss ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>You must n't talk like that ! A father must be much — much better than anybody else !</p>

     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Ssh ! Please ! Please ! . . . I can quite understand : indeed , indeed , I can ! I 'm sorry — oh , so sorry for you . You are thinking of yourself and of your own little girl — the little girl who does n't know what you have been telling me . Do n't be miserable ! I 'm sure it will all turn out right in the end — things always do ; far better than you dream ! Only . . . do n't take away my little dream !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She turns away her face . ROBERT rises heavily .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>All right , miss — I wo n't : swelp me Gawd , I wo n't . Do n't cry , miss . Do n't , miss ! Breaks my ‘ eart — after all you 've done for me . I ort never to ‘ a ’ bin born — mekin ’ you cry ! Thank you kindly , miss : thank you very kindly . I 'll — I 'll tek my ‘ ook .</p>

     <p>Oh , but I 'm so sorry for you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>Thank you , miss .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>I did so want to help you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>You ‘ av ’ , miss .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Before you go , wo n't you tell me your name ? Who are you ? ROBERT . I . . . I got no name worth speakin ’ of , miss : I 'm — just the bloke wot 's a-lookin ’ arter the drains . Good-bye , miss .<stage>At the door , he turns .</stage>Sorry I used bad words , miss .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She runs to him and offers her hand . He takes it .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Good-bye ,</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>Good-bye , miss .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out .</stage>
    <stage>She shuts the door after him , and turns a wretched little face towards the audience as the curtain falls .</stage>

   <div type="act" n="4">
    <head type="act">THE FOURTH ACT</head>
    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>As the curtain rises , the scene and situation remain unchanged . After a moment , Mary comes down to the settee , left , and buries her face in the cushions , weeping . Shortly , the handle of the drawing-room door is turned , and from within there emerges a murmur of voices , the Vicar 's uppermost .</stage>
     <stage>VICAR [ within ] . Very well , then , after you have finished your letters ! . . .</stage>
    </stage>
    <stage>The voices continue confusedly : MARY rises quickly and goes into the garden .</stage>
    <stage>The VICAR enters and goes to the mantel-piece weariedly : a moment later , AUNTIE . ] BISHOP [ within ] , I shall only be about twenty minutes . AUNTIE [ entering ] . All right , do n't hurry , James : you have all the morning .</stage>
    <stage>She closes the door upon the BISHOP 'S grunts , and comes , to the middle of the room .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Hm ! When he has finished his letters !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , things seem to be shaping better than we thought , William . Perhaps we have a little misjudged him .<stage>He looks at her curiously .</stage>To think , my dear , that the rebuilding of the church is becoming possible at last ! All your hopes , all your enthusiasms , about to be realised ! Now , it only remains to gain your brother Joshua 's approval and help , and the scheme is complete !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Supposing he — does n't approve of the scheme ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>My dear , he must approve : he will see the advantages at once . I think James made that perfectly clear ! . . . And then , look at the opportunities it creates for you ! Not only the church , William , the beautiful big church of your dreams , with the great spires and flashing crosses and glorious windows ; but a much larger sphere of usefulness than you ever dared to dream ! Think of your work , William , of your great gifts — even James had to acknowledge them , did n't he ?— Think of the influence for good you will be able to wield ! Ah ! And then I shall see my beloved , himself again — No more worry , no more feverish nights and days , none of the wretched frets and fancies that have been troubling him all this morning ; but the great Scholar and Saint again , the master of men 's souls , the priest in the congregation !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Suppose you try and forget me for a moment . Do you think you can ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>William , that 's unkind ! Of course I can n't .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>It might mean the salvation of my soul .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , William ! Now you 're going to begin to worry again !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Oh no : I 'm quite calm . Your brother 's powers of reasoning have left me philosophical . . . . Tell me , are you quite sure that you have grasped the full meaning of his project ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Of course ! You think no one can understand a simple business dealing but men ! Women are every bit as clever !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Well , then , this project : what was it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>James explained clearly enough : the affiliation of your brother 's scheme with that of the society he mentioned .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Yes — what society ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>The Society for the Extension of Greater Usefulness among the Clergy . . . . It was an admirable suggestion — one that ought to appeal particularly to you . Have n't you always said , yourself , that if only you had enough money to . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Did you happen to realise his explanation as to the constitution of the society ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>To tell the truth , I was n't listening just then : I was thinking of you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>The financial possibilities of the scheme — Did his eloquence on that point escape you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Figures always bore me , and James uses dreadfully long words .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Did you hear nothing of profits ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>I only heard him say that you were to . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Well , did n't it strike you that throughout the entire discussion he spoke rather like a tradesman ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>My dear , you can n't expect everybody to be an idealist ! Remember , he 's a practical man : he 's a bishop .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Did n't it strike you that there are some things in this world which are not to be bought at any price ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>My dear William , bricks and mortar require money : you can n't run a society without funds !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Yes , but what of flesh and blood ? What of reputation ? What of a man 's name ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Whatever do you mean now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Did n't his proposal practically amount to this : that we should turn my brother Joshua 's name and reputation into a bogus Building Society , of which the funds were to be scraped together from all the naked bodies and the starving bellies of the world , whilst we and our thieving co-directors should collar all the swag ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Now , that 's exactly where I think you are so unjust ! Did n't you yourself refuse , before he spoke a word , to let him put a penny of his own into the concern ? I must say , you were unnecessarily rude to him about that , William !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Yes , and did n't he jump at the suggestion !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>He offers to give his patronage , his influence , his time . All he asks of your brother is his bare name .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Yes , and all he asks of me is simply my eloquence , my gift of words , my power of lying plausibly !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>William , he is offering you the opportunity of your life !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Damnation take my life !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>William , why are you so violent ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Because violence is the only way of coming to the truth between you and me ! AUNTIE<stage>now thoroughly afraid</stage>What do you mean by the truth , William ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>I mean this : What is the building of this church to you ? Are you so mightily interested in architecture , in clerical usefulness , in the furtherance of God 's work ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>I am interested in your work , William . Do you take me for an atheist ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>No : far worse — for an idolater !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>William . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>What else but idolatry is this precious husband-worship you have set up in your heart — you and all the women of your kind ? You barter away your own souls in the service of it : you build up your idols in the fashion of your own respectable desires : you struggle silently amongst yourselves , one against another , to push your own god foremost in the miserable little pantheon of prigs and hypocrites you have created ! AUNTIE<stage>roused</stage>It is for your own good we do it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Our own good ! What have you made of me ? You have plucked me down from whatever native godhead I had by gift of heaven , and hewed and hacked me into the semblance of your own idolatrous imagination ! By God , it shall go on no longer ! If you have made me less than a man , at least I will prove myself to be a priest !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Do you call it a priest 's work to . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>It is my work to deliver you and me from the bondage of lies ! Ca n't you see , woman , that God and Mammon are about us , fighting for our souls ? AUNTIE<stage>determinedly</stage>Listen to me , William , listen to me . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>I have listened to you too long !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>You would always take my counsel before . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>All that is done with ! I am resolved to be a free man from this hour — free of lies , free of love if needs be , free even of you , free of everything that clogs and hinders me in the work I have to do ! I will do my own deed , not yours ! AUNTIE<stage>with deadly quietness</stage>If I were not certain of one thing , I could never forgive you for those cruel words : William , this is some madness of sin that has seized you : it is the temptation of the devil !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>It is the call of God ! AUNTIE<stage>still calmly</stage>That 's blasphemy , William ! But I will save you — yes , I will — in spite of yourself . I am stronger than you .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They look at each other steadily for a moment , neither yielding ,</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Then I accept the challenge ! It is God and I against you ,</l>
      <l>Martha !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>God and I against you , William .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>So now — for my work ! AUNTIE<stage>quietly</stage>Yes : what are you going to do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Three things .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes — and they ? . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Tell Mary everything : send for my brother , Robert : and then — answer that monster in there . AUNTIE<stage>fearfully</stage>William , you would never dare ! . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Look ! . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MARY re-enters from the garden .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Auntie ! Uncle ! I want to speak to you at once — both of you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>You are just in time : I wanted to speak to you at once .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Is it important , uncle ? Mine 's dreadfully important .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>So is mine . AUNTIE<stage>quickly</stage>Let the child speak , William . Perhaps . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>I hardly know how to begin . Perhaps it 's only my cowardice . Perhaps it is n't really dreadful , after all . . . AUNTIE<stage>troubled</stage>Why , what are you thinking of , Mary ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>It 's about something we have never spoken of before ; something I 've never been told . VICAR<stage>searchingly</stage>Yes ? . . . AUNTIE<stage>falteringly</stage>Yes ? . . .</p>

    <stage>There is a short silence . The VICAR looks at AUNTIE .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Now : is God with you or me , Martha ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>What do you mean by that ? Is it very terrible , uncle ?</l>
      <stage>He stands silent , troubled . MARY crosses him , going to AUNTIE .</stage>
      <l>Auntie . . .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Do n't ask me , child : I have nothing to tell you about your father .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Why , is n't he . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>I have nothing to tell you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>I have .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>William ! . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>I have , I say ! Come , sit here , Mary .<stage>She sits to left of him , on the settee . AUNTIE is down stage on the other side of him .</stage>Now ! What do you want to know about your father ? MARY<stage>passionately</stage>Everything there is to know !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>William , this is brutal ! . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>It is my work , Martha !— God 's work ! Have n't I babbled in the pulpit long enough about fatherhood and brotherhood , that I should shirk His irony when He takes me at my word ! Now : what put this thought into your head to-day ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know . I 've been puzzling about something all the morning ; but there was nothing clear . It only came clear a few minutes ago — just before I went into the garden . But I think it must have begun quite early — before breakfast , when I was talking to my — to Manson ,</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Manson ! . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>And then , all of a sudden , as I was sitting there by the fireplace , it came — all in a flash , you understand ! I found myself wishing for my father : wondering why I had never seen him : despising myself that I had never thought of him before .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Well , what then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>I tried to picture him to myself . I imagined all that he must be . I thought of you . Uncle William , and Uncle Joshua , and of all the good and noble men I had ever seen or heard of in my life ; but still — that was n't quite like a father , was it ? I thought a father must be much , much better than anything else in the world ! He must be brave , he must be beautiful , he must be good ! I kept on saying it over and over to myself like a little song : he must be brave , he must be beautiful , he must be good !<stage>Anxiously .</stage>That 's true of fathers , is n't it , uncle ? Is n't it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>A father ought to be all these things .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>And then . . . then . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Yes ? . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>I met a man , a poor miserable man — it still seems like a dream , the way I met him — and he said something dreadful to me , something that hurt me terribly . He seemed to think that my father — that perhaps my father — might be nothing of the sort !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Why , who was he — the man ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>He would n't tell me his name : I mistook him for a thief at first ; but afterwards I felt very , very sorry for him . You see , his case was rather like my own . He was wishing for his little girl .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>There is a short silence .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Where did you meet with him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Here , in this room .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>When was this ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>A few minutes ago — just before you came in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Where is he now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>He said good-bye . He has gone away .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>For good ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I think so : I understood him to mean that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Was he — a rough-looking man ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Dreadfully ; and he swore once — but afterwards he said he was sorry for that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Did he frighten you at all ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>No , not exactly frighten : you see , I felt sorry for him . VICAR<stage>slowly</stage>And he would n't tell you his name ? . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>No : I asked him , but he would n't .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The VICAR ponders this for a moment .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Now , is it God with you or with me , William ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>For a moment this unnerves him . Then setting his teeth together , he faces his task stubbornly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Have you any idea about this man ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>How do you mean — any idea ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>As to why he put this doubt into your head about your father .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>He seemed to be thinking about himself , and how unworthy he was of his own little girl .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Did he say — unworthy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>That 's what I think he meant . What he said was that perhaps my father was n't good enough to be your brother , uncle . That 's not true , is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>No , by Heaven ! That 's not true ! MARY<stage>rapturously</stage>Oh , I knew it , I knew it ! VICAR<stage>in an agony</stage>Stop ! You do n't understand !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>I understand quite enough ! That 's all I wanted to know !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Listen , child ! Listen ! I mean that it is I who am not worthy to be called his brother .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>William , this is absurd ! MARY<stage>snuggling up to him</stage>Is n't he a dear ? VICAR<stage>freeing himself</stage>Listen to me , Mary : I have something awful to tell you : try and bear it bravely . You will hate me for it — never love me again ! . . . No , listen ! . . . Supposing your father were — not what you imagine him to be ? . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Uncle , did n't you just say . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Supposing that wretched man you spoke with just now were right , after all ! What would you say ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Uncle ! . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Supposing he were one upon whom a11 the curses of the world had been most cruelly visited — his poor body scarred and graven out of human semblance ; his soul the prey of hate and bitterness ; his immortal spirit tortured and twisted away from every memory of God ! What would you say ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Uncle , it would be terrible — terrible !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>What will you say , then , to the man who has brought him to such ruin ? What will you say to that man being God 's priest ? What word of loathing have you for the thief who has stolen the love of another man 's child , for the murderer who has slain his brother 's soul ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Uncle , do you mean . . . do you mean . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>I mean that I am the man !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>You ! . . . AUNTIE<stage>passionately</stage>It is not true ! It is a lie ! It 's entirely your father 's own fault !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>I do n't understand . Why should Uncle William lie to me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>He is overwrought : he is ill . It is like your uncle</l>
      <l>William to take upon himself another man 's wickedness !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Then , that is true , at least : my father is a wicked man ! . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>I do n't want to speak about your father !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>He is nothing that I have wished him to be : not brave . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Yes — that at least ! MARY<stage>turning towards him</stage>Beautiful ? . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>What do you mean by beautiful ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>You know what I mean : What you once said God was , when you called Him beautiful .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>I have no right to judge your father .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She perceives the evasion .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Not even — good ? . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>He is what I have made him . I and no other !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She stands looking at him piteously .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>There is another — I ! I kept them apart : I poisoned your uncle against him : I took you away from him : It was I who kept you in ignorance of your father !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Why ? . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Because he stands in the way of my husband 's happiness ! Because , even , he is your father ! Because I hate him ! I could almost wish him dead !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Martha ! . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>There is a long pause .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Then I have nobody , now . It 's no use wishing any more .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Mary . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>No ! . . . I want to be alone .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She goes out into the garden . They follow her out with their eyes .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>So ! God has revealed His partisanship !— He has beggared us both !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>AUNTIE considers this for a moment . Then , with sudden determination , she rises .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I am not going to be beggared without a struggle for it ,</l>
      <l>William !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <stage>She moves briskly across to the bell .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>What are you going to do , Martha ? AUNTIE ,<stage>flashing round passionately , before she can ring the bell</stage>Do you think I am going to stand by and see your life wrecked — yours and that child 's ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>We are not the only persons concerned , Martha .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>As far as I care , you are !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>And what of Robert ? . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Robert ! That 's what I 'm going to see to now !</l>
      <stage>She rings the bell .</stage>
      <l>There 's only one way of dealing with a brute like that !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>What 's that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Pack him off to Australia , Africa — anywhere , so long as we are never pestered with him again ! VICAR , Do you think you 'll get him to go ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I 'll find the money ! A drunkard like that will do anything for money ! Well , he shall have plenty : perhaps he 'll drink himself to . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>By Heaven , but I say no !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>By Heaven , but I say yes ! It 's about time I took things in hand again ! Do you think I 'm going to risk that child learning everything ? She knows more than enough already ! Providentially , she does not know the worst !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>And what knowledge do you consider Providence has so kindly spared her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>The knowledge who that man was ! She shall never know , if I can have my way !<stage>She rings the bell again , impatiently .</stage>Why does n't he come ? Why does n't he come ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Who ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Manson .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Enter MANSON by the main door . There is a subtle change in the manner of him , a look in his eye , as of the servant merging in the master .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>You rang .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , come in , Manson . I want to have a little confidential talk with you — confidential , you understand . MANSON<stage>eying her</stage>If you please . I expected this .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He has the air of a judge . She hurries on , unheeding .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Manson , you saw everything . You were here when that dreadful creature arrived .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Which ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Why , my husband 's brother , Robert . Did n't you tell me ,</l>
      <l>William , that Manson heard everything he said ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Then you will know the wretched plight we are in . Manson , it 's terrible . I want your help . By-the-way , you have not spoken about it to the other servants ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>I am always most discreet . AUNTIE<stage>touched</stage>Thank you , Manson , thank you : I felt that I could trust you . It 's to prove my trust that I 've sent for you now . Perhaps I 'd better begin by explaining everything quite clearly , so that you . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>There is no need . I know everything already . AUNTIE , Everything ! How ? . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>A certain gift of divination — mine by birth . And , besides , you forget that I had a long conversation with your brother-in-law after master left the room .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>What ! Whilst my brother was here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Yes : we all three had breakfast together .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Breakfast together ! Then James has heard all !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Not quite all . You may have observed that your brother is a little deaf .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>But surely — What did he think ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>He mistook him for your husband .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>My husband !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Your brother is also a little blind , remember . AUNTIE<stage>delighted</stage>Then James never found out ? . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Oh yes : I took care to undeceive him on the point .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Good gracious ! How did he take it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>At first , a little angrily ; but , after a while , some few poor words of my own chanced to move him to more — profitable meditation .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Manson , you 're perfectly wonderful ! I respect you very , very much !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>It is not enough . I shall require more . AUNTIE<stage>embarrassed</stage>Oh , of course , I shall be glad to do anything that . . . Why , what do you mean ? . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>I mean that service such as mine demands a greater recompense !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>You may be sure that anything in reason . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>It must go beyond that !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Well , what do you ask ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>The uttermost obedience , loyalty , and love !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Manson , how dare you ! By what right . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>By my own right !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>This is insolence ! What right do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>The right of understanding , the right of purpose , and the right of will !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>You force me to speak angrily to you ! Do you forget that you are my servant ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>No ! And , therefore , it is my office to command you now ! Sit down , and hear me speak !</p>

     <p>He has been sent to help us ! Martha , this is God !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Over here , please .</l>
      <stage>He points to the settee .</stage>
      <l>AUNTIE . I . . . I . . .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <stage>MANSON still points . She wavers as in a dream , and at length moves mechanically across the room , obeying him .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Now , let me tell you exactly why you have sent for me here . There is a strange and wretched turmoil in your soul : you have done wrong , and you know it — but you do n't know all ! You would keep what miserable little right you have by bolstering it up with further wrong . And you have sent for me to help you in that wrong !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>How dare you say that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Have n't you sent for me to help you in your plans about his brother , Robert ? AUNTIE<stage>faintly</stage>What plans ? . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>The plan of banishing him further from your lives than ever ! The plan of providing for him ! The plan of patching up his bitter wrongs with gold !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>How did you know that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>I know you ! What , do you think that God 's eyes are like your brother 's — blind ? Or do you think these things can be done in darkness without crying aloud to Heaven for light ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>I am here to work my will , not yours !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>What gain do you hope to bring yourself by that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>I am not thinking of myself ! I am thinking only of my husband 's happiness !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Behold the happiness you have already brought him !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>There is the child ! It would break her heart !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>What is her heart but broken now — by you ? AUNTIE , Robert himself would be the first to repudiate any other plan .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Have you tried him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Of course not ; but he must see the impossibility .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>What impossibility ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>The impossibility of having him here : the impossibility of letting him see the child : the impossibility of him and his brother ever meeting again !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Is that your only difficulty ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Only difficulty ! What , would you have me welcome him with open arms ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Yes , and heart , too !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Have him here , entertain him , treat him as a guest ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>As an honoured guest !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>In this house ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>This house .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Good Heavens ! what else ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Sweep and garnish it throughout , seek out and cleanse its hidden corners , make it fair and ready to lodge him royally as a brother ! AUNTIE<stage>desperately</stage>I wo n't do it ! I can n't ! I can n't !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>With my assistance , you can !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Manson , how can we bring it about ? AUNTIE , I dare n't ! I dare n't !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>I dare ! I will !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>In God 's name , how is it possible ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Make me the lord and master of this house for one little hour !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>By Heaven , yes !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>And you ? You ? . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She falters a few moments : then , utterly broken down , she whispers , feebly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Then first TO CLEANSE IT OF ITS ABOMINATIONS !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The BISHOP enters from the drawing-room . He carries a letter in his hand .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>Well , here is the letter I have written to the secretary of our Society : I have explained everything quite nicely ; and have warned him , of course , against doing anything definite in the matter until we have consulted your dear brother . Now . . . Eh , what ? Oh ! . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MANSON has tapped his ear , peremptorily : he fixes his ear-trumpet .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>I bear you a message from the master of this house . Leave it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>Really , I . . . . . . . Most extraordinary ! Hm !<stage>He blows down the ear-trumpet , and afterwards wipes it very carefully with his handkerchief . MANSON stands , as though carven in marble , waiting for him to fix it again .</stage>Now : again , please .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>You are no longer necessary . Leave this house .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>You scoundrel ! You impudent scoundrel ! You . . . You . . . Give me back my five-pound note ! MANSON<stage>pointing to the fire</stage>It is invested for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>I will have it back at once !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Hereafter , was the arrangement .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Smythe ! Where are you ? Do you hear what this blackguard says ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>I endorse it , every word .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>Martha ! . . .<stage>She turns away from him as from some horror of sin . The BISHOP stands dumfounded for a moment or two : then he boils over .</stage>Now I see it all ! I 've been trapped , I 've been tricked ! Martha , this is all your doing ! Brought me here on a trumped-up story of relationship with the Bishop of Benares , to insult me ! Oh , what would that godly man say if he heard of it !— And he shall hear of it , believe me ! Your infamy shall be spread abroad ! So this is your revenge , sir —<stage>he turns to the VICAR</stage>— your revenge for the contumely with which I have very properly treated you , sir ! Now I understand why I was made to sit down and eat sausages with a butler — yes , sir , with a butler and a common working-man ! Oh ! I could die with shame ! You have bereft me of all words ! You . . . You . . . You are no scholar , sir ! And your Greek is contemptible ! . . .<stage>He crosses to AUNTIE .</stage>Martha ! You are no sister of mine henceforward !<stage>Going , he returns to her .</stage>Anathema maranatha !<stage>He bounces up to the door , but turns back again for a last word with MANSON .</stage>And I have one word for you , sir ! You are a scoundrel , sir — a cheat , an impostor ! And if I could have my way with you , I would have you publicly whipped : I would visit you with the utmost rigour of the law : I would nail you up , sir , for an example !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>I have encountered similar hostility before , my lord — from gentlemen very like your lordship . Allow me . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He opens the door , his eyes flashing .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BISHOP</speaker>
     <p>Do n't trouble , sir . I can get my hat and my stick and my portmanteau for myself ! I can do very well without your assistance — thank God !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He stumps out . MANSON closes the door after him , barring it , as it were , with his great left arm . He lifts the other arm slowly , as commanding silence . After a moment the front door is heard slamming noisily .</stage>
    <stage>AUNTIE sinks , weeping , upon the settee . The VICAR goes over to comfort her . The uplifted hand of MANSON assumes the BISHOP 'S sign of blessing as the curtain slowly falls .</stage>

    <head type="act">THE FIFTH ACT</head>
    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>As the curtain rises , the scene and situation remain unchanged .</stage>
    </stage>
    <stage>There is heard a Ring of the Bell . All three turn their heads , alert .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>If it 's my brother . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>Which ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>I meant — the Bishop of Benares ; but . . . AUNTIE<stage>hand on his arm , apprehensively</stage>William . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MANSON</speaker>
     <p>It wants ten minutes of the time you said you expected him .<stage>Goes to door : turns .</stage>Only ten minutes .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out , closing the door softly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Ten minutes ! . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>We shall never be able to do it , William ! How can we possibly undo the work of all these years in ten minutes ? It wants a miracle .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>We must make the attempt , somehow .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes — yes : how ? Oh , I have been blind — blind !<stage>She walks across the room in agitation .</stage>Where has he gone , I wonder ? We do n't even know that — where he is ! VICAR<stage>making a movement</stage>Perhaps Manson . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>No , no , no : it must be ourselves . . . Ten minutest — And no assistance on his side : we can n't expect it , after our treatment of him . He will hate me most of all : there 's the chief difficulty ! . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>You would say me , if you had seen his face and heard his voice this morning !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>God help us . God pity us !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Amen . . . Then , there 's the child , too ! That difficulty must be faced .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Yes — no escape ! We shall have to pay the whole debt ,</l>
      <l>William : I see that .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Who knows ! Perhaps the child will have to pay most , when all is done .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>The innocent for the guilty — yes . . . Oh , William ,</l>
      <l>William , can you ever forgive me ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>There is much to forgive , both sides , Martha . My sin has been greater than yours . You have only loved unworthily in blindness : I have seen clearly and been a coward .<stage>Enter MARY from the garden .</stage>Mary ! . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Let me speak , uncle . I have been thinking , out there in the garden — thinking very hard : I 've been trying to put things together again and make them straight ; but it 's still very difficult . Only there 's one thing — I 'm sorry I was unkind just now : I did n't mean it : you are everything I have — everything I have ever had ; and as for what uncle said — about himself , I mean — I can n't believe it . No , I 'm sure there 's a mistake somewhere ; and mistakes can always be put right , if we only help one another and mean it . Shall we try , uncle ? Shall we , auntie ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>If it 's not too late ! . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>It can n't be too late , auntie dear , if we all wish very hard . I was a coward to give up wishing . That was my sin , too !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>God knows , I wish , Mary ! . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>And I ! . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>And , indeed , I do ! . . . Now , I 've been thinking : I 've been trying to look the worst in the face . Supposing my father is the wicked man you say — the very , very wickedest man that ever lived , do n't you think if we tried to love him very much it might make a difference ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>What made you think of that , Mary ? . . . MARY<stage>simply</stage>It 's what you taught me , uncle , in your sermons .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>I taught you ? . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Yes : and , besides , there 's another reason . . . I 've been thinking of the poor man I met this morning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AUNTIE</speaker>
     <p>) Yes . . . VICAR . ) What of him ? . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>He said he was a wicked man , and at first he looked so dreadfully wicked , I believed him ; but when I began to look at him closely , and heard him talk about his little girl , everything seemed different ! I could no more believe him , than I can believe you , uncle , when you say such awful things about yourself ! I believe he was a much better man than he ever dreamed ! And so I think we might find my father just the same , if he was properly loved and looked after ! VICAR<stage>with determination</stage>Then listen to me , Mary : I have something to tell you : that very man you spoke to . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>ROGERS enters , his face betraying signs of his morning 's affliction .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROGERS</speaker>
     <p>Beg your pardon , sir ; but . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Yes , Rogers : what is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROGERS</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Manson sent me , sir ; it ai n't my fault ! . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Do explain yourself , Rogers !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROGERS</speaker>
     <p>Well , sir , it 's a bit orkard : it 's . . . I really do n't know what you 'll say , sir , I do n't really . . . VICAR<stage>impatiently</stage>Come , come , come , what is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROGERS</speaker>
     <p>It 's a man , sir !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Well , there 's nothing very extraordinary in that . Wants to see me , eh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROGERS</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir ; and what 's more , Mr. Manson told me to bring ‘ im in !</p>

    </sp>
    <stage>There is a general rapturous excitement .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Praise God ! Shew him in at once ! ROGERS<stage>flabbergasted</stage>What ! In ‘ ere , sir ? . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Come , come , come !<stage>ROGERS 'S cosmos is fast slipping away : he crawls abjectly to the door : his hand on the knob , he turns once more a face of bewildered inquiry upon the VICAR , who snaps his fingers impatiently .</stage>ROGERS<stage>with a sickly smile</stage>‘ E 's just outside , sir .<stage>Opening the door , he whines .</stage>Oh , do come in .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>ROBERT enters , amply fulfilling the lad 's description . The latter lags out , nauseated with the world .</stage>
    <stage>ROBERT stands up stage , in the middle : AUNTIE and VICAR , down stage , one on either side . MARY with her aunt .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>Can I be ‘ eard civil in this ‘ ouse , if I speak a few words ?<stage>They make a movement as towards him .</stage>‘ Old back ! Do n't you come near me ! Do n't you so much as speak till I 've done ! . . .<stage>To Auntie and Vicar respectively</stage>You do n't know me : you do n't know me . . . Understand ?

    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p>Why , it 's my friend — the man I was telling you about ! The man who looks after the drains !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>That 's about it : I 'm the drain-man , see ? Thought you might be mistakin ’ me for — summat else , if you was n't told . Now you know .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MARY 'S face , as she returns , bears the first dawn of an idea . The VICAR lifts a hand of warning to AUNTIE .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>Go on .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>That 's what I come ‘ ere to talk abaht — my job . P'r ' aps you 'll think as it ai n't a tasty subjic , before a lot o ’ nice , clean , respectable people as never ‘ ad anythin ’ worse on their fingers than a bit of lawn-dirt , playin ’ crokey ; but some one ‘ as to see to the drains , some one ‘ as to clear up the muck of the world ! I 'm the one . An ’ I 'm ‘ ere to tell you about it . AUNTIE<stage>involuntarily</stage>Oh ! . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>Yes ; but not in the way you mean ,</p>

     <p>But you know , you really are a little unpleasant !</p>

     <p>The stench — the horror — the darkness . . .</p>

     <speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
     <p>What 's it matter , if the comrides up above ‘ av ’ light an ’ joy an ’ a breath of ‘ olesome air to sing by ? . . .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VICAR</speaker>
     <p>What , already ! Let 's have him in at once !</p>
