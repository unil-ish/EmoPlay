     <stage>SCENE : The Church of the Nativity . New York .</stage>
     <stage>The set , representing only the chancel , is as deep as possible , so that , even when its foreground is brightly illuminated , the detail back of that is lost in shadows . Pierced by three fine stained glass windows , the rear wall looms above the altar , on which the candles are not lighted . In front of that is the sanctuary , and , in front of that , the communion rail , with three steps to the stage . Just right of these steps is a very tall and beautiful Christmas tree . The tree has been expensively trimmed , and has a practical connection for an electric-lighted ornament still to be placed at its top . Down R ., a door to the choir room , and , down L ., a door to the parish house and the street . These doors are exactly alike . Down L ., two folding wooden chairs that have been brought in for temporary use . A tall stepladder L. of the tree , facing front . Down R ., two wooden boxes of ornaments , that on top open and half emptied . There is a pile of tissue-wrapped and ribboned packages under the tree , and a general litter of gifts , boxes , and crumpled paper everywhere . The Church of the Nativity is fashionable and luxurious ; the effect of the set must be that of a peeping into a building spacious , magnificent , and majestic .</stage>

    <sp>
     <speaker>AT RISE : Christmas Eve , 1918 . The act begins in bright</speaker>
     <p>day-light — about half past three in the afternoon — so that the early winter twilight may have set in before its end . The sun 's rays now come through a stained-glass window above the door L ., so that the R. of the stage is bathed in white , the C. in blue , and the L. in a deep straw . Two women and a girl are discovered . MRS. HENRY GILLIAM , bending over the box down L ., is fat , forty , rich and self-satisfied . Her daughter , DAFFODIL , commonly called “ Dilly , ” perched upon the ladder , is a “ flapper . ” As regards her mind , this means that , at twenty , she is wise and witty , cynical and confident , worldly and material beyond her elders . Physically , she is pretty , and , of course , has not hesitated to help out nature wherever she has thought it advisable . Considering what has been spent on her education , she is surprisingly ignorant and discourteous , particularly to her mother , who bores her dreadfully . LEILA THORNBURY is a divorcee ; thirty , smart , good-looking , with something feverish in her face , in her eyes , in her movements . Deliberately attractive to men , she is disliked , in proportion , by women . All three are very expensively dressed . Mrs. Thornbury has laid aside a fur coat on the cost of which twenty families might have lived a year . She is at the end of the stage , concerned with a number of dolls and other toys .</p>

     <p>What I can n't understand is why our young women want to go around looking like chorus girls !</p>

     <speaker>MRS. THORNBURY</speaker>

     <p>I do n't know why not . We 've had almost everything else .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DILLY</speaker>
     <p>Mother 's so Mid-Victorian ! And ministers are finding they 've got to do something to make church-going attractive . What do we get out of it now ? I 've heard of preachers who go in for dances and movies , and they draw crowds , too . Naturally ! Who would n't go to church to get a squint at Douglas Fairbanks ?<stage>She has hung the star</stage>I 'm through !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MR. BARNABY</speaker>
     <p>One moment !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He opens the door L. Enter MRS. TICE followed by JERRY GOODKIND . MRS. TICE has just entered middle-age , and refuses to shut the door behind her . Her wealth , which has given her an air of great authority , has made it possible for her to look a smartly-dressed young matron . The truth is that she is clinging to youth in an ever-lessening hope of “ keeping ” her husband . Beneath the “ air of authority ” is something cowed , and worried , and unhappy . Just so , beneath the smiling , careless surface of JERRY lies iron . He can be very ugly when he wishes , and he is always sufficiently determined to get what he wants , though he gets it generally by showing the urbane surface . JERRY would describe himself as a “ kidder . ” He is 35 ; sleek , well-groomed , and perfectly satisfied with himself . His most engaging point is a perpetual smile .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TICE</speaker>
     <p>Hello , everybody !<stage>“ Everybody ” returns the greeting</stage>Who are those people on the church steps ? A lot of dirty foreigners blocking the sidewalk !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MR. BARNABY</speaker>
     <p>It 's the grating , Mrs. Tice . The furnace room 's underneath , and they 're trying to keep warm .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TICE</speaker>
     <p>Well , let ‘ em try somewhere else !<stage>Recollection of unpleasant contact causes her to brush her coat</stage>I do n't mean to be unkind , but there must be missions or something !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MR. BARNABY removes the coat , and then climbs to attend to the star</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. THORNBURY</speaker>
     <p>We did n't hope to see you here , Mr. Goodkind .</p>

    <stage>Everybody laughs , and , on the laugh , enter DR. WADHAM . He is not the stage clergyman . On the contrary , he is a very pleasant and plausible person — plausible because he believes implicitly in himself . He has passed sixty , and has a really kind heart .

     <speaker>DR. WADHAM</speaker>
     <p>Yes , dear lady .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TICE</speaker>
     <p>My husband wanted me to have a little talk with you about his check .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She pauses for encouragement , finding what she has been told to say a trifle difficult ] You know , he promised five thousand dollars to beautify the parlor of the Parish House .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. WADHAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Foreseeing trouble</stage>Oh , yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TICE</speaker>
     <p>And since then — well , frankly , Doctor , John was very much upset about last Sunday 's sermon . Mr. Gilchrist preached from the text about the rich man entering the Kingdom of Heaven .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. WADHAM</speaker>
     <p>Always a trifle dangerous .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TICE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , and last Sunday it seemed as if he were directing all his remarks at John . We 're in the first pew , you know , and John says he does n't like to complain , but there 's getting to be altogether too much of this — Bolshevism . John says the preachers are more than half to blame for the present social unrest . I heard the sermon , and I agree with John that some of it was positively insulting !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. WADHAM</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Gilchrist is young .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JERRY</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Gilchrist is a nut !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TICE</speaker>
     <p>Do you know what he said , Doctor ? He said all this — “ decking the church ” — was making an accomplice of God . He said we could n't take credit to ourselves for returning a small portion of our ill-gotten gains !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>Small portion ! When I 've just given away five hundred pounds of coffee !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TICE</speaker>
     <p>He said charity was n't giving away what you did n't want !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>It was good coffee , too ! Our second best coffee !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. TICE</speaker>
     <p>Of course , what John objected to was the reference to rents — to charging clerks and bookkeepers more than they could pay for “ wretched little flats . ” John says he does n't come here to be told how to run his business !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>Quite right ! And I do n't pay seven thousand dollars a year to hear my husband 's coffee roasted !<stage>They all laugh — the more because of the previous tension . MRS. GILLIAM , surprised at first , sees the point , and joins in the laughter .</stage>Well , you understand what I mean !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. WADHAM</speaker>
     <p>We understand , Mrs. Gilliam .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>Personally , I 'm very fond of Mr. Gilchrist . His father had stock in our stores . But I do n't think he 's a good influence . This used to be a really exclusive church . Now , whenever Mr. Gilchrist preaches , there 's such a crush of undesirable people in the galleries you can hardly get to your pew . We do n't have that trouble with Dr. Wadham !</p>

     <p>Mr. Gilchrist is n't exactly poverty-stricken !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JERRY</speaker>
     <p>No ; he got quite a lot of money from his father . You like him and when you said “ yes , ” you thought you were getting somebody you liked , and all the rest of it , too . But something 's gone wrong with Gilchrist , and you know it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>Why do you say that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JERRY</speaker>
     <p>Because , if you did n't before , you heard this afternoon . I saw you standing in the door . And I 'm going to tell you a few things more !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>I do n't want to listen !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JERRY</speaker>
     <p>Maybe — but you will ! Do you know that your young trouble-hunter has given away nearly one-tenth of his capital in three months ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>No , and I do n't believe it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JERRY</speaker>
     <p>All right ; ask my father ! The old man has his money in trust ! Gilchrist wo n't touch his income from Gilliam Groceries , because they 're profiteering , and he 's preaching such anarchy that both wardens are coming this afternoon to complain to Dr. Wadham ! I do n't want you to throw yourself away on a raving bug !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>And your advice is ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JERRY</speaker>
     <p>Marry me . I 'm a nice fellow , too — and I can give you what you really care about . You 're over your ears in debt , without any chance of paying up — or cutting down . And you are , shall we say , twenty-nine in October ? I know what it cost you when your father died , and you had to come down a peg . You do n't want to keep on — coming down , do you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>

     <p>I 've said : “ What 's the use bluffing ? ” I 'm no movie hero — and no crazy dreamer . I 'm a little shop-worn , perhaps — maybe , a little soiled — but I 'm sane , and I 'm solvent . You 're good-looking , and smart , and a lady . You 'll help my standing and I 'll help your credit . For the rest — we need n't bother each other too much .... What do you say ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

GOODKIND is much like any other successful business man you might meet — and like — at dinner . He is brisk and economical of time , but pleasant , and , unless his interests are involved , extremely amiable . He does what he conceives to be his duty by his family , his community , and his God , and feels that all three should appreciate it .</stage>

     <p>Mr. Benfield is n't interested in clothing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>No , but he 's invested heavily in my West Virginia coal mines , and down there we 're on the verge of the biggest walk-out in our history . You see what I mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. WADHAM</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>The labor problem 's none of the church 's business . Or any outsider 's business . It 's a worrisome subject , and there 's no good stirring it up . That 's what you want to tell Gilchrist !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. WADHAM</speaker>
     <p>I have told him ... frequently .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>And what 's the answer ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. WADHAM</speaker>
     <p>He says every problem ought to be the church 's business , and that , until the church becomes a power in live issues , it is n't a power in life !</p>

     <speaker>MR. BARNABY</speaker>
     <p>Why do n't he go over to the Synagogue instead of hanging around a Christian Church ? Mr. Gilchrist gave this fellow his overcoat . I suppose he 's come back for the gloves !</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. WADHAM</speaker>
     <p>I 've asked myself that . I 've asked myself if what he saw in France ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>Exactly . A lot of young fellows go off the handle and start out to reform the world , but this lad has run through twenty thousand dollars in less than three months !</p>

     <speaker>DR. WADHAM</speaker>
     <p>In addition to his salary ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>Yes . I could understand if he 'd spent the money on himself , but he has n't ! He 's given it away !<stage>DR. WADHAM shakes his head</stage>Gilchrist 's father was my first partner , and I got the boy in here , and I feel responsible for him . As trustee , I can refuse to turn over another penny of his principal , and , as senior warden , I can demand his resignation from this church . But I want him to have every chance . Tell him if he 'll get a grip on himself , and reconsider tomorrow 's sermon ——<stage>Enter BENFIELD L .</stage>Here 's Benfield !</p>

    <stage>“ CHARLIE ” BENFIELD is fifty , and a “ rough diamond . ” He is self-made , and proud of it , though nothing really good — nothing of education , or refinement , or knowledge and appreciation of fine things — has gone into the making . He is arrogant , domineering , used to having his own way , and to sweeping aside obstacles . He comes in with his hat on his head , and it is a minute later , when DR. WADHAM 'S glance makes him aware of the fact , that he removes it .</stage>

     <lg>
      <l>We 're not ! We 've been discussing long enough ! All I got to say now is :</l>

     <p>Is n't that a little mandatory ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BENFIELD</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know what it is , but it goes ! I 've worked hard all my life , and now this fellow gets up and tells me what I 've worked for is nothing , and that I 'm nothing , and all my ideas is wrong !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. WADHAM</speaker>
     <p>He did n't say that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BENFIELD</speaker>
     <p>Oh , yes , he did — last Sunday and every Sunday ! I 've got two million dollars tied up in Black River mines , and I 'm not paying to have the socialist papers down there print that my own minister is in favor of strikes !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>Wait a minute , Charlie ! That 's not the tone to take to Dr. Wadham ! We all feel that Gilchrist has gone too far , and we 're agreed ——</p>

     <p><stage>Smiling</stage>A church that is n't big enough for two little men , Mr. Benfield , must be somewhat crowded for God !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>BENFIELD cannot trust himself to answer . He jams his hat upon his head , and exits L. GILCHRIST is 33 . He was a football hero at college , and shows it . He was a gentleman before he went to college , and he has been one ever since , and he shows that , too . What he does n't show is what one expects in a “ reformer ” — narrowness , hardness , something forbidding . An ascetic , beyond doubt , self-denial has only made him trim and fit . The goodness that shines in his face is partly good humor . He has honest eyes , with fire in them , and there is strength and zeal back of that — strength and zeal that will leave their mark later . As yet , his exaltation is chiefly in his smile . His great gift is charm — and sympathy . At this moment , he wears no overcoat , and is glowing from the cold . Still smiling , he looks after BENFIELD .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. WADHAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Embarrassed</stage>Mr. Benfield is a little — ah — a little ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Yes ; a little .</p>

    <stage>GOODKIND crosses for his hat , and observes DANIEL , who is chafing his wrists .</stage>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. WADHAM</speaker>
     <p>When you 're as old as I am , Daniel , you 'll understand that being honest does n't necessarily mean being disagreeable .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Does n't it mean — telling the truth ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>DR. WADHAM</speaker>
     <p>Do you know the truth , Daniel ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Yes ; do n't you ? Does n't every man — in his heart ? And if we want to keep it in our hearts , and never think about it or look it in the face , should n't someone pry open the door and cry : “ Behold ” ?... I did n't tell them anything they did n't know , Doctor . I do n't know anything they do n't know . I just reminded them ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. WADHAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Exploding on the last word</stage>That we were heathen !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>That we were Christians , and every man our brother , and that we were sitting , overdressed and overfed , in a Christian Church , while our brother froze and starved — outside — in a Christian World !</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>DR. WADHAM</speaker>
     <p>That is n't fair ! These good people have given ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Given — what cost them nothing ! Frumpery and trumpery and diamond stars ! That 's how all of us give — what we do n't need ; what we do n't even want !... You 're a good man , Doctor , and , honestly , what would you say tomorrow if your wife told you she 'd sold her rings , and given the money to the poor ?</p>

     <p>Oh , yes , there is ! There 'll be people lying in the parks tonight . What would Mrs. Tice say if I invited them to sleep in her pew ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. WADHAM</speaker>
     <p>That there 's no reason why she should share dirt and disease !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Exactly ! We may believe in the brotherhood of man , but we know about germs ! We 're not sure what is truth , but there 's one thing we are sure of , and mean to be sure of , and that 's our own comfort ! You know that , and I know it , and they know it — but we must n't say it ! All right ; in God 's name , what are we to say ?</p>

I understand you intend to talk about the strike .<stage>Dan nods “ Yes ”</stage>And that 's not a very pleasant subject for Christmas . Would n't it be more fitting to preach from the text , “ Glory to God in the Highest ” ?</p>
    </sp>

     <p>“ And on earth , Peace , good will toward men ” ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>DR. WADHAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Delighted</stage>Yes ! You might say , “ There are many kinds of peace —— ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>But there are n't !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. WADHAM</speaker>
     <p>There is physical peace — peace that came with the end of this cruel war !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>There is no peace ! There is only fear — and hate — and vanity — and lust , and envy , and greed — of men and nations ! There are only people preying on one another , and a hungry horde at the very doors of your church !... My text will be : “ And Peter followed afar off . ”</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>DR. WADHAM</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. WADHAM</speaker>
     <p>Wondering ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>What would happen if anybody really tried to live like Christ .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>DR. WADHAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Shaking his head</stage>It can n't be done .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Is n't it worth trying ? Men risk their lives — every day — in experiments far less worth while . We 've had centuries of “ fear , and hate , and greed ” — and where have they brought us ? Why not try love ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. WADHAM</speaker>
     <p>How can you make them try ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>By showing that it would work .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. WADHAM</speaker>
     <p>It wo n't work , Daniel . It 's a beautiful ideal , but it wo n't work . Times have changed , and things are different . Life is n't as simple as it was two thousand years ago . The trouble with you , Daniel , is that you 're not practical .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>I wonder .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. WADHAM</speaker>
     <p>And the great need of the church is practical men . We must n't take the Scriptures too literally . We must try to interpret their spirit . And , above all , we must please our congregations , or we sha n't have any . And then what becomes of our influence ? Better fall back on my text for tomorrow , Daniel .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>I can n't .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Yes .</p>

     <p>Must have been a cuckoo !</p>

     <p>About the money ? Yes .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>Why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Well , there 's the strike , and a good deal of unemployment , and I 've got so much . Why — I 've got you !</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rises</stage>Let 's not talk about it now .<stage>She turns L. Hesitates ; looks at her wrist watch ; looks off L .</stage>Yes ; let 's !— You 're so changed . I hardly know you . We do n't seem to want the same things any more .</p>

     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>What do you want , Clare ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>I want to be happy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>That 's exactly what I want !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>How can anybody be happy without money ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>How can anybody be happy with it ? Anyway , do you think people are ? Happier than the people who just have enough ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>In our day and age there 's nothing worse than poverty ! There 's nothing more degrading than having to scrimp , and save , and do without , and keep up appearances ! I 've tried it ... ever since my father died ... and I know ! I can n't do it any longer , and I wo n't !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Clare !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p><stage>She turns away , and comes back somewhat calmer</stage>I do n't want to quarrel with you , Dan . I just want you to be sensible .... I love you , but I love the good things of life , too . I like to be warm and comfortable .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>You can be sure of that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>But that 's only the beginning . I want good clothes , and furs , and my car , and money to spend when I like . I want my own house , and my own servants , and a husband who amounts to something . I 'm no different from other women of my class .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>I hoped you were .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>A year or two ago people thought you were going to be a Bishop . Today you 've made an enemy of every influential man in the church . All that may be very noble , but I 'm not noble , and I do n't pretend to be . I do n't feel any call to sacrifice myself for others , and I do n't think you have any right to ask it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>I do ask it , Clare .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>You mean you 're going on like this ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>I mean I can n't give you expensive clothes , and servants , and a big house while all about us people are hungry .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>What do you propose to give me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>A chance to help .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>To help wash the dishes , I suppose , in a three-room flat in a side street !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>And to visit the sick , and befriend the friendless .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>A charming prospect !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>It really is , Clare . You do n't know how happy we can be with work , and our modest plenty . There 's so much to do — and they wo n't let me do it here . We 've got to get near the people in trouble , and we can n't with a big house and all that . I do n't think we shall come to a three-room flat .<stage>He smiles</stage>We 'll have five or six rooms , and our books , and each other .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>I can n't believe you 're serious . You 've always been a dreamer , but I can n't believe you 're going through with this fantastic nonsense !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>I 've chosen a narrow path , dear , but I hoped it might be wide enough for us both .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>It is n't . With your means and opportunities , you 're offering me what any bank clerk would give his wife . I thought you loved me , but you 're utterly selfish , and I think a little mad . You 've a right to throw away your own life , but you 've no right to throw away mine .<stage>She hands him his ring</stage>Our engagement is off .<stage>A pause . She starts for the door , and then hesitates , looks at her wrist watch , waits for him to call her back . When he does n't , she returns .</stage>Do n't you think you 're making a terrible mistake ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looks up from the ring . Simply</stage>No .<stage>CLARE turns again , this time quickly and with resolution , and exits L. The church is quite dark , except for light streaming from the open door R. DAN looks at the ring , and puts it in his pocket . With his back to the audience , he looks at the altar of his church . Suddenly , from R ., the organ is heard , playing “ Hark the Herald Angels . ” He crosses and closes the door . In the blackness , he hears a step . THE POOR MAN has come on through the open door L .</stage>Who 's there ?... Are you looking for someone ?</p>

     <speaker>POOR MAN</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>

     <p>I think you can .</p>

     <p>Let 's have it then .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>POOR MAN</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps I can help you , too .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>In what way ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>POOR MAN</speaker>
     <p>In my way .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>My poor man , I wish you could !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>His despair impels him to confide in anyone ]: I was so sure of what I wanted to do , and now I begin to wonder if it can be done !</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>POOR MAN</speaker>
     <p>It has been done .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>But in this day — in this practical world — can any man follow the</l>
      <l>Master ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>POOR MAN</speaker>
     <p>Why not ? Is this day different from any other ? Was the world never practical before ? Is this the first time of conflict between flesh and spirit ? If it could be done then , why not now , and , if it was ever worth the doing , why not now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>But how ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>POOR MAN</speaker>
     <p>We have been told how .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>“ Take no thought of the morrow .... Sell whatsoever thou hast , and give to the poor .... Love thy neighbor as thyself .... Bless them that curse you , do good to them that hate you . ” But if a man did those things today people would think him mad !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>POOR MAN</speaker>
     <p>What does it matter ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>He would lose everything !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>POOR MAN</speaker>
     <p>And gain everything !</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>POOR MAN</speaker>
     <p>Why do n't you try ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>He tried , and they crucified Him !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>POOR MAN</speaker>
     <p>Did they ? And if they did , what does that matter ? Is a man dead whose ideal lives ? Ye crucified me , but I am with ye alway , even unto the end of the world !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>In God 's name , who are you ?</p>

    <stage>As he speaks , slowly the tree and everything beneath it is illuminated by the Star of Bethlehem . The light , dim at first , grows stronger and stronger , its rays revealing sanctuary and picking out the points of the cross on the altar . But where the POOR MAN stood is nothing . There is no one there . The spirit — if spirit it was — has disappeared . The man — if man it was — has gone . DANIEL gives a cry , and , as he does so , the light is extinguished , and suddenly , to the music that has been heard faintly through the door R. during this scene , the full choir sings : “ Hark the Herald Angels Sing . ” In black darkness</stage>

     <stage>SCENE : GEORGE F. GOODKIND 'S Library . New York .</stage>
     <stage>Ten months later . The set has only two essentials — a wide , curtained , glass door L ., and an ordinary , heavy wooden door down R. The first gives entrance to the music room , which is indicated rather completely when the door is open . The second , by way of a hall and a flight of stairs , leads to the main entrance of the house . For the rest , the library is a shallow room , very much like any other library in the home of any other rich and well educated man . It is a little richer and more luxurious than most , perhaps , with — here and there — priceless things from palaces in Venice or art collections in Rome . The obsession of business is suggested by various utilities , transient and otherwise — a row of law books , a small file , and a pile of papers upon the substantial library table .</stage>

     <speaker>AT RISE : It is a Saturday evening in November , 1919 . The</speaker>
     <p>GOODKINDS have been entertaining informally at dinner , and , having finished the chief business of the occasion , the company is now diverting itself in the music room . This room is brilliantly illuminated ; one sees the shadow of a man leaning against the glass door . DILLY GILLIAM , at the piano , is playing one of the syncopations popular at the time . After a moment , a servant , with a card tray , enters R ., crosses and exits L. An instant later , GOODKIND , in evening clothes , enters L. He has a card in his hand . The SERVANT re-enters , re-crosses , and re-exits , stopping , en route , to switch on the lights . GOODKIND looks at the pile on the table , and turns the topmost paper face down . BENFIELD , also in evening clothes , enters L .</p>

     <p>No ; spies and agents provocateur . I hate the breed , but what are you going to do about it ? This fellow , Max Stedtman , got into the union five or six years ago , and now he 's one of the delegation they 've sent up to me .... Where 's Jerry ?</p>

     <p>Who has scruples and no qualifications .</p>

     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>Thus striking a balance . I mean that ! Do n't make any mistake about Gilchrist . He 's a valuable man . I did n't hire him because I was sorry he got fired out of the church ... and only a little because I knew his father . I hired him because he had theories , and I wanted to try ‘ em out !</p>

     <p>I 'll say he 's got theories !</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>Yes , and the remarkable part of it is ... sometimes they work . They worked up at that power plant . A year ago I would n't have taken it as a gift . Gilchrist applied a little soft soap —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BENFIELD</speaker>
     <p>Soft soap or gold dust ?</p>
    </sp>

     <p>I told you what he was doing at the mines . Now he wires you , “ Everything settled if you accede to rational conditions , ” and up comes this delegation ! What are the conditions ? I 'll tell you now — surrender ! You 're crazy if you see these workmen ! We 've nothing to discuss ! They 're our mines , and we 'll run ‘ em as we like !

     <p>I mean I would n't mention Gilchrist to Joe Hennig .<stage>BENFIELD whistles .</stage></p>

     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>That 's rot !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>STEDTMAN</speaker>
     <p>Anyhow , Hennig and me are two votes , and I figure Hennig 's 'll cost about ....<stage>He looks at them narrowly .</stage>fifteen thousand dollars .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>All three show surprise .</stage>

     <p>Not when it is n't necessary .</p>

     <p>And Gilchrist wired yesterday : “ Everything settled . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JERRY</speaker>
     <p>On conditions .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Yeh — on their conditions ! Take it from me , this Gilchrist has double-crossed you !</p>

     <p>I told you !</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEDTMAN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Goes right on , without heeding the simultaneous interruption</stage>He 's been at union meetings ! He got ‘ em to send this delegation , and he tried to get ‘ em to turn down Hennig — our one best bet ! You take it from me —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quietly</stage>I wo n't take it from you , Stedtman .<stage>Looks around</stage>Or from anybody else . I know this man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEDTMAN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Cowed</stage>Well , he 's gone around talkin ’ compromise . Compromise ai n't no way to settle a strike . Givin ’ ‘ em confidence . Why , we got a couple o ’ hundred representatives among the workmen tellin ’ ‘ em they got no chance . We got special police clubbin ’ ‘ em every time they try to hold a meeting . You would n't believe what we done down there in the way of harmony !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>It 's all been done before .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEDTMAN</speaker>
     <p>Never no completer ! We 're workin ’ the black list and , if a man opens his mouth too wide at a meetin ’ , somebody — he do n't know who — tips the gover'ment that he 's a “ red . ” We got ‘ em so they ai n't sure of their own brothers . We 're postin ’ bills , in seven languages , saying : “ Why should workmen mistrust the company ? This is the land of opportunity ! America is calling you — GO BACK TO WORK ! ” The boss has a scheme now to start a riot between the Poles and the Wops ! And you know the end o ’ that ! Troops , and scabs , and machine guns ! What stopped it ? One gent that do n't know nothin ’ about harmony , or co-operation , or nothin ’ — except hangin ’ around after a skirt ! If you got to descend to bribery now , do n't blame me ! Blame Gilchrist !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>BENFIELD</speaker>
     <p>He ought to be brought back right now !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>SERVANT</speaker>
     <p>Two men to see Mr. Stedtman .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>BENFIELD</speaker>
     <p>Good !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>Bring them in .</p>

    <stage>Servant exits</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEDTMAN</speaker>
     <p>Now look — do n't try nothin ’ before Umanski ! Just give us an excuse to vote right , and then we 'll go out , and get rid of him , and I 'll slip back with Hennig ! Now then —<stage>His sharp ears have heard footsteps off R. He strikes a pose</stage>It 's very good of you gentlemen to see us ! I was goin ’ to meet my friends outside —<stage>The Servant ushers in UMANSKI and JOE HENNIG , and retires</stage>— but you been so kind and agreeable — Hello , Joe !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JOE</speaker>
     <p>Hello , Max !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>UMANSKI</speaker>
     <p>You said you be on sidewalk .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEDTMAN</speaker>
     <p>I just really got in myself . This is Mr. Goodkind . He 's the President . And a couple o ’ Directors . Well , now we can get down to business !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He sits . UMANSKI stares in amazement at his temerity . UMANSKI is a giant Pole or Russian . Whatever flesh he ever had has been starved off ; he is all bone and brawn . In his face is something strangely like poetry ... something born of silence and suffering . He is in his best , which does not obliterate the picture of the man in working clothes , his sleeves rolled up over his muscular arms . Hennig is a stocky man of 45 — a “ grouser . ” His tone has none of the courage , the dignity , the independence of UMANSKI 'S ; he blusters , emptily , an echo , without much to say , and one guesses he might be made to bluster either way . There is a pause .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>Smoke ?<stage>He presents the humidor to HENNIG , and STEDTMAN , rising , reaches out and helps himself . GOODKIND goes on to UMANSKI , who does n't unfold his arms ; does n't even appear to see the box . GOODKIND returns , and sets it lower right end of table .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JOE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coming down R. of GOODKIND</stage>I guess you know all about our grievances .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>I did n't know you had any .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JOE</speaker>
     <p>You did n't know we had any ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BENFIELD</speaker>
     <p>Ah , you fellows are never satisfied !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>You 're getting plenty for what you do ! What are you complaining about ?</l>
      <l>You 've left good jobs to follow a lot of idle , discontented agitators !</l>
      <l>We 've got to win this fight on principle ! The work 's there ! I pay what</l>
      <l>I can get men for , and not a cent more ! Take it or leave it !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JOE</speaker>
     <p>We got to hang together to get anything !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>You 're hanging , and what have you got ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The piano music in the next room , which ceased during the scene with STEDTMAN , is succeeded now by the low tones of a violin . UMANSKI speaks , in a voice as unemotional as its owner is stolid .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>UMANSKI</speaker>
     <p>I work twelve hours — every day ... thirty years ... got nothing .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>JERRY</speaker>
     <p>Nobody asked you to take the job ! Nobody asked you to come over here ! You 're not an American !</p>

     <p>What do you want ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>UMANSKI</speaker>
     <p>I wanna chance to learn ! I wanna chance to live ! I wanna see ... sun !</p>

     <speaker>UMANSKI</speaker>
     <p>God 's sun . I never see him . Go to mines — him not up . Work in mines — him not see . Go home — him gone . Got baby five years ago . Never see him . Go to mines ... him , not up . Come back — him asleep . Go home one day — him gone .</p>

     <speaker>JERRY</speaker>
     <p>When you worked you had enough to eat , did n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>UMANSKI</speaker>
     <p>Yes . Work twelve hours a day and got enough to eat — so can work some more . Always work . Get up — work — come back — sleep — get up — work . Never got time to talk to wife — never got time to talk to nobody — never got nowhere . Never save nothing .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>JOE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Whining</stage>It ai n't fair !<stage>JERRY takes out his cigarette case .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>UMANSKI</speaker>
     <p>That little box — what you pay for him ?<stage>Jerry turns front , not deigning to answer</stage>Ah , I know ; gold . You pay more for him than I got from swing pick thirty years . Me and six families — we live in one house you own . We got one room upstairs ; two down cellar . Sleep there . Eat — cook — wash upstairs . See nothing but brick yard , and clothes hang up to dry . Wife — she carry water from yard . Me — I carry potato peeling out front . Him rot . If I do n't like that , I quit — and starve !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JERRY</speaker>
     <p>You want to live on Fifth Avenue !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BENFIELD</speaker>
     <p>And then you 'd find something to kick about !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>UMANSKI</speaker>
     <p>If I do n't like other mans will . Other mans take my job . I got little girl twenty years old . Awful nice little girl . Got gold hair . Got blue eyes . Her take sick . She sorry she 's sick . She wanna go church . She ask me : “ Pop , buy me new dress for church . Buy me pretty pink dress . ” Where I get him ? We hire doctor once , and he say : “ Air — sunshine — milk — eggs ! ” Where I get air — sunshine — milk — eggs ? Got no job . My little girl , she cough , and cough , and one night she die . I tell you we got right to quit ! We got right to hang together ! We got right to fight — to live — and , by God , we gonna fight — we gonna live — we gonna — BY GOD !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The music stops . In the same short instant , there is a patter of applause ; more music — lively this time — and , bursting into the room from L ., DILLY runs into UMANSKI . She has gold hair ; she has blue eyes ; and what is more , she has a new dress . It is a “ pretty pink dress , ” too , and its owner wears jewels worth the ransom of a dozen Umanskis .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DILLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>As she enters</stage>Now , look here , Jerry ; you 're not going to — Oh ! I 'm sorry !<stage>UMANSKI looks at her ; then covers his face , and , with a great sob , drops into a chair R. C. STEDTMAN puts his arm about the man 's shoulders . GOODKIND , C ., stares at him sympathetically .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JERRY</speaker>
     <p>You 'll have to wait , Dilly .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>Ask the ladies to stay in the drawing room . We 'll join them in a few minutes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DILLY</speaker>
     <p>Yes .... Certainly .... I 'm SO sorry !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She exits . A pause . STEDTMAN , one arm about UMANSKI , uses the other to signal GOODKIND to go ahead . GOODKIND ignores him .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>I think we 'd better let this go for tonight .</p>
    </sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>We 're going to get together . You fellows have got the wrong idea . We 're not tyrants , or monsters . We 're Christians , and we want to act like Christians . Only ... we 've got to live , too . We 've got to have the things we 're used to , just as you have . But I think I can promise , if the strike 's called off , you men will be kept , and put back just where you were .... Ring the bell , Jerry .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>JERRY does so . A pause .</stage>

     <speaker>UMANSKI</speaker>
     <p>What about this here twelve-hour day ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>And the twenty-four-hour shift ?</p>

     <speaker>UMANSKI</speaker>
     <p>Then what good we gain by strike ?</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Nothing 's ever gained by quarreling . You 'll find that out some day .</p>

     <p><stage>Seriously . Wondering</stage>Yes .<stage>She takes the scarf .</stage></p>

     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>Pretty generous husband ... if you ask me !</p>

     <p>Upon my word , I do n't know what you women want !... A man works his heart and soul out to get you things , and still you 're not satisfied !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>Maybe we 'd like a little “ heart and soul . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>Heart and soul , and what a man trades ‘ em for ! You want your husband to succeed , and give all his attention to you ! You want him to have plenty of money , and plenty of time ! You 're willing to take everything , but you 're not willing to pay for it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>I suppose everybody must pay .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>Surest thing you know ! You women are all alike . My poor wife — she had everything , and I used to catch her crying in a corner . We never seemed to understand each other ... after we got this . She was a good wife , too , but the best of you never seem to want what you have .... Sometimes I think we do n't any of us really want what we struggle so hard to get . Sometimes I think we 're all wrong !<stage>He looks at his watch , and rises .</stage>Well , I guess I 'll go downstairs !</p>

     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>I 'll be down in a minute .</p>

     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>Tell Riggs — will you ?— if any one comes , I 'll be ... talking to Jerry .<stage>He puts his hand on her shoulder</stage>And ... buck up ! There are people worse off than we are ... and it 's a great life if you do n't weaken !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He exits L. CLARE goes C. She puts the box , with its contents , on the table , dries her eyes , and is powdering her nose when DANIEL GILCHRIST opens the door R. He is in business clothes , and starts to retire when he sees CLARE . He would a little rather avoid the interview .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>Come in ! I 'm just powdering my nose . Does that offend your reverence ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>On the contrary ; I agree with the man who said , “ Put your trust in</l>
      <l>God , and keep your powder dry . ”</l>

     <p>No , I have n't everything I want , but I 'm happy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>My father-in-law says if you settle this strike you 're to be — but that 's a business secret .<stage>A pause</stage>I suppose I might tell you .<stage>A pause</stage>He says it 'll make you a big man in the company ... with a tremendous salary .... You must n't give it away !</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>The secret ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>The salary ... I suppose you 've got over that .... So ... you do n't really seem to have lost anything by giving up your church .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>No . Queer as it seems , sometimes I think I 've gained ... in opportunity .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>You frightened me so that night , with the bugaboo of poverty . Do n't you think there might have been a compromise ? Something half way ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Why open wounds that are beginning to heal ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>Yours seem quite healed .</p>

     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>You see ... I was selfish ... to ask you to give up the things that count so much with you for those that count with me .... Afterward , when I knew you were to be married ... I was afraid for you ... and I was wrong again .<stage>He rises</stage>You 're happy ... and I 'm honestly glad !</p>

     <speaker>JERRY</speaker>
     <p>Of course it 's the truth ! And , if it was n't , I do n't see that you 've any right to ask questions ! I have n't done anything that was n't in the bargain ! I have n't done anything every man does n't do !</p>

    <stage>They stare at each other ... close together . Suddenly , JERRY lifts his open hand , and strikes DAN across the mouth . DAN starts to retaliate , but controls himself , opens his clinched hands , and lowers his head .</stage>

     <p><stage>In almost speechless amazement</stage>Dan ; you 're not going to take that ?</p>

    <stage>The scarf in her hand , she exits L. A short pause . Suddenly , JOE , emboldened by what he has witnessed , certain of DAN 'S cowardice , breaks from STEDTMAN and rushes at GILCHRIST .</stage>

     <p>You 'll play around my wife , will you ?<stage>DANIEL merely looks at him .</stage>You will ... will you ?... Take that !<stage>He strikes out . DANIEL seizes his wrist , and , with one powerful , dexterous movement , hurls him to the floor</stage></p>

    <stage>Quick exit . He closes the door , which has been left open by HENNIG . The two men look at each other . JERRY goes to upper left of table , and pours himself a drink .</stage>

     <speaker>JERRY</speaker>
     <p>Well , you 've made a nice mess of it ! Why can n't you keep your nose out of other people 's business ? Why did you have to date my leaving Black River ?</p>

     <p>No ? You expect me to believe that when you admit —— Why did you pull that hero stuff ? Why did you keep your mouth shut when I lost my temper ? Why did you turn the other cheek ?</p>

     <p>Thanks ... again .</p>

     <p>I 'm dog-sick of rowing with labor ! It 's such utter damned waste !... Excuse me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>I agree with you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>I 'd hate to figure what walk-outs have cost this country !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Yes . I often wonder why it would n't be cheaper to keep the men contented .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>How 're you going to do it ? Do n't forget there are as many people paid for stirring up strikes as for crushing ‘ em ! Paid well , too ! What the laboring man needs is a real interest in his job !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Why do n't you give it to him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND How ? By doubling his wages ? The more most of ‘ em get</speaker>
     <p>the less they want to do for it ! You know that !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>They 've got a notion that you get rich by riding around in a limousine !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Do n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>Not often ! Not unless you think while you ride ... or your father thought for you ! Even then , money does n't stay long in bad company ! To hear those fellows you 'd think there was n't any work , except what 's done with a pick ! The man that really produces is the man with the idea !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>The man that produces most .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>Yes , and he ought to get most !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>He does !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>He always will ! Show me a big man and I 'll show you somebody who 's done a big job ! It 's the little man with no capacity and no chin that cries about a conspiracy to keep him from being President !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>There 've got to be little men , too , Mr. Goodkind .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>And they 've got to be satisfied with little rewards ! We can n't all have the same bank-roll any more than we can all have the same health ! That 's where unions go wrong ! When you tell a man he 's going to have the same reward , whatever he does — not because he 's got ability , but because he 's got a union card — down goes the standard , out goes incentive , and to hell goes the whole social structure !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Right !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>That 's why I 'm fighting the unions ! Not because I want to starve the man who works , but because I want to fire the man who does n't ... and reward the man who does ! I want to give every man a good reason for doing his best ! You can talk equality and democracy all you like , Dan , but the minute the average man is n't afraid of being fired he is n't afraid of being worthless ! The minute you take away incentive — the chance to get this — that minute you reduce the world to a common level of common indifference and common futility !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Right as far as you went , but you only went part way ! You have a right to a profit on your idea , and your investment , and the labor you put back of it ! The public has a right to coal , and transportation , and all it needs and pays for ! But , above everything else , the workman who works honestly has a right to something more than the barest kind of a bare living ... and it can all be done if you do n't sink everybody 's rights to accumulate a fortune you do n't need and can n't use !... All the argument on earth can n't make you all right so long as there 's a Umanski in the World !</p>

     <stage>SCENE : “ Overcoat Hall . ” New York .</stage>
     <stage>This room — not too large — was the “ front parlor ” of a comfortable residence in down-town New York . Business , of the least attractive sort , and the slums long since have occupied the district . The building is a red-brick , low-stoop , English-basement house . The rear wall , which is the front of the dwelling , is pierced by two lofty windows , through which are seen the top of an iron railing , and a row of similar structures , fallen into decay , across the street . Between these windows , upon a low marble shelf , now holding a tray of cups and saucers , originally was a tall , gold-framed mirror . Over this hangs a blackboard , upon which has been chalked : “ And so , to the end of history , hate shall breed hate , murder shall breed murder , until the gods create a race that can understand . ” Beneath the right window is a big radiator . Down stage R. are folding doors , partly open , or a large single door — whichever shall prove advisable . These — or this — lead to the main hall , and so to the basement , or upstairs , or to the front door , which slams solidly whenever it is closed . Left is a decrepit , white-marble mantel , with a “ fake ” fireplace . In front of this — in a jog , perhaps — a small platform , of the kind used in public schools . Upon this , a small table and a chair . Down stage of it , a geographical globe , suspended over which a wall-pad informing us that today is Wednesday . Above the mantel-shelf , another blackboard , upon which are some simple calculations , and the axiom , “ Luck is work . ” In the center of the room is a long library table , with a brown cover , and with numerous kitchen chairs about it . On the table a reading lamp , a bowl of yellow , purple and brown chrysanthemums ; and numerous books and magazines . Gilchrist has succeeded in making the old place comfortable and inviting . It is a combination of club , settlement house , school , reading room and lecture hall . Brown linoleum covers the floor , and there are brown denim curtains over the windows . A history chart hangs on the wall . There are book-shelves , and two or three big , comfortable chairs ; a phonograph and , perhaps , even a motion picture machine .</stage>

Grubby , seated down stage of the center table , is concealed behind a copy of “ The Woman 's Home Companion , ” which he has opened wide , and , holds in front of him . Mack , a shabby ne'erhYpppHeNdohYpppHeNwell , between thirty and forty years old , opens the doors R ., and peers in uncertainly . Reassured by the character of the room , he enters , and looks about him curiously . Even from the rear , it is evident that Grubby is a person of no authority , so Mack dismisses him , temporarily , and warms his hands over the radiator . Next he inspects the quotation between the windows , pauses at the phonograph , and arrives in front of the platform L. The three words on this blackboard interest him . He reads them , turns away , turns back , and reads them again . At last , he sniffs contemptuously , and , completing his circuit , stops on the left of Grubby .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MACK</speaker>
     <p>Hello ... you !<stage>GRUBBY lowers his paper , and reveals a sixty-year-old face , round , very red , and framed in a scraggly gray beard .</stage>Is this Overcoat Hall ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRUBBY</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MACK</speaker>
     <p>I 'm looking for Mr. Gilchrist .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRUBBY</speaker>
     <p>He ai n't in , but he will be .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MACK</speaker>
     <p>Are you working here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRUBBY</speaker>
     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MACK</speaker>
     <p>Is anybody working here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRUBBY</speaker>
     <p>Mary Margaret .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MACK</speaker>
     <p>Who 's she ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRUBBY</speaker>
     <p>A girl .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MACK</speaker>
     <p>What girl ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRUBBY</speaker>
     <p>The girl that cleans . A lame girl . Her mother 's the janitor . Have a seat . Somebody 'll be along in a minute .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>And he resumes his magazine ... never completely abandoned . Mack , thrown upon his own resources , picks up one periodical after another , but Fortune does not smile . They prove to be “ The Atlantic Monthly ” ... “ The Review of Reviews ” ... “ The Scientific American . ”</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MACK</speaker>
     <p>What are you reading ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRUBBY</speaker>
     <p>A piece about “ Better Babies . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MACK</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laughs</stage>Are you going into the baby business ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRUBBY</speaker>
     <p>No . I was a hansom driver .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MACK</speaker>
     <p>Handsome !<stage>The laugh becomes uproarious .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRUBBY</speaker>
     <p>Ah ... hacks ! I drove hacks ... man and boy ... forty years . Then taxis come in , and I went out !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MACK</speaker>
     <p>What 'd you do then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRUBBY</speaker>
     <p>Took to drink .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MACK</speaker>
     <p>Yeh ; then drink went out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRUBBY</speaker>
     <p>What 's your job ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MACK</speaker>
     <p>Well , I was in the movies . That is , I was going to be , but the fellow that was going to put up the money , his mother did n't die , after all .... Before that , I sold bricks ... a few weeks . I sold books , too . And life insurance . I never had any luck . Who wrote that , “ Luck is Work ” ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRUBBY</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Gilchrist .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MACK</speaker>
     <p>Well , it is n't ! I 've worked at fifty things , and look at me ! I figure the world owes me a living , and here I am , waiting for a bite of grub and an overcoat ! Is it true the boss 'll give you an overcoat ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRUBBY</speaker>
     <p>He will if he 's got one .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MACK</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>That 's what a fellow told me . He said that 's why they call this</l>
      <l>Overcoat Hall .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRUBBY</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MACK</speaker>
     <p>I suppose a hard-luck story 's the proper spiel .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRUBBY</speaker>
     <p>You do n't get no chance for a spiel . He do n't ask you nothing . You just come , and help yourself , and talk things over ... if you want to . Coffee and sandwiches every night — and suppers and sermons on Wednesdays .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MACK</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Preaching !</l>
      <stage>Looks at the wall pad , and reaches for his hat .</stage>
      <l>Wednesday . I 'll be back Thursday .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRUBBY</speaker>
     <p>Not regular preaching ! Just talks ! Sometimes they 's a picture show ... but the pictures is rotten ! No shooting , or nothing ! But you can always sneak a little snooze ‘ til you get to the hand-out !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MARY MARGARET enters through the open door R. Her two crutches are rubber-tipped , so her invasion is noiseless . She occupies herself with the cups and saucers C. MARY MARGARET is fifteen , and pathetically pretty . The conspicuous feature of her costume is a pair of soiled gold slippers that once set off a ball gown .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MACK</speaker>
     <p>Do n't he try to reform you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRUBBY</speaker>
     <p>Naw ! The way he talks , you 'd think you was as good as him . He says to me , the other night , he says , “ You 're a good man yet , Grubby , ” he says . “ You 're strong and healthy , ” he says , “ and , if you learned to drive a taxi , all the best people in New York would be telephoning for your cab . I 'll lend you the money , ” he says . Gee ; he almost had me started !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MACK</speaker>
     <p>What 's the catch ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRUBBY</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MACK</speaker>
     <p>There must be graft in it somewhere .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRUBBY</speaker>
     <p>If you ask me , I think the poor gent 's got a few nuts in his nose-bag . A little bit batty . That 's what I say !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY MARGARET</speaker>
     <p><stage>Turning down</stage>And that 's what you got no right to say , Grubby !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRUBBY</speaker>
     <p><stage>To MACK</stage>Mary Margaret .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY MARGARET</speaker>
     <p>He 's been good to you , ai n't he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRUBBY</speaker>
     <p>That 's why we think he 's nutty . What 's he do it for ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY MARGARET</speaker>
     <p>‘ Cause he loves you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRUBBY</speaker>
     <p>What for ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY MARGARET</speaker>
     <p>God knows !<stage>She has brought down a cup and saucer , with other utensils , and is clearing and setting a place at one end of the table . With this exclamation , she locates the cup somewhat forcibly .</stage>After seven o'clock now , and the meeting in half an hour , and he ai n't had a bite since morning !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MACK</speaker>
     <p>Where is he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY MARGARET</speaker>
     <p>He went to see a man that killed himself .<stage>MACK laughs</stage>I mean ... tried to . It was in the papers this afternoon , and Mr. Gilchrist says : “ I want to talk to that man . ”<stage>MACK 'S interposition has brought his words to her mind , and reflecting on them , she explodes .</stage>Graft !! Why he did n't have the rent money yesterday , and he was desprit ! He ai n't had money to get himself a pair of shoes , and nobody helps him , or comes near him , but you bums that roast him behind his back !<stage>GOODKIND appears in the doorway R .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRUBBY</speaker>
     <p>I did n't roast him . I just said he was crazy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p><stage>Crisply</stage>Mr. Gilchrist ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY MARGARET</speaker>
     <p>He 'll be here any minute . Wo n't you come in ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>Thanks .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He comes forward a few steps , and looks at GRUBBY , who , after an instant , takes refuge behind his Home Companion . GOODKIND crosses to MACK , who turns up stage . He surveys the blackboard . MARY MARGARET finishes her task .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY MARGARET</speaker>
     <p><stage>Offering a periodical to GOODKIND</stage>Take a magazine , and sit down .<stage>With a nod , he accepts .</stage>I got to go make the coffee .<stage>To GRUBBY</stage>You can come and carry it up in about fifteen minutes .<stage>She turns and catches MACK filching a loaf of sugar .</stage>Graft !! ... Well , you ought to know !<stage>She exits R ., singing “ I 'm a Pilgrim . ” By now , GOODKIND is reading in a big chair L. MACK glances at him , and comes down to GRUBBY .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MACK</speaker>
     <p>Think she 'll tell him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRUBBY</speaker>
     <p>Naw ! Anyway , he do n't care ! He says we 're all brothers in God .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MACK</speaker>
     <p>Gee !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRUBBY</speaker>
     <p>That 's what he told Jimmie Curran — brothers in God — and Jimmie just up for pinchin ’ a guy 's pants . Jimmie lives across from his room upstairs , and Jimmie says he 's clean loco .<stage>GOODKIND notes name and address on the margin of his magazine .</stage>Guess what he 's got in the back yard !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MACK</speaker>
     <p>What ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRUBBY</speaker>
     <p>Tennis . And handball games for children . And , in the other two houses , he 's got flats ... with bathtubs ... and the rents ai n't what they ask now for stalling a horse . Why would n't I say he was crazy ? Everybody says so but Mary Margaret !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DANIEL enters R. He is shabby , but beaming . He carries two books , which he lays on some piece of furniture up R .; after which he removes his overcoat , and hangs it over an old umbrella already suspended from a wall-rack down stage of the door .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Hello , Grubby ! You 're early ! And you 've brought a friend ! That 's fine !<stage>He shakes hands with MACK .</stage>You 're very welcome !<stage>Sees and crosses to GOODKIND</stage>And Mr. Goodkind ! Well ! You 're welcome , too !<stage>Shakes hands</stage>Have you come down to look us over ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p><stage>His eyes indicating the others</stage>I 've come down on personal business .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Oh , yes !<stage>Turns</stage>Grubby , there 's a box of books in the hall . How would you and your friend like to ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GRUBBY</speaker>
     <p>I promised to help with the coffee .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>I see .<stage>GRUBBY exits . To MACK , who has been stealing surreptitious glances at the overcoat</stage>And you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MACK</speaker>
     <p>I just wanted to speak to you a minute .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>All right . After the meeting .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MACK</speaker>
     <p>I wanted to ask you ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>After the meeting !<stage>Turns back to GOODKIND</stage>Sit down .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sitting</stage>Thanks .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MACK — resentful , unobserved , uncertain of getting the coat honestly — is sorely tempted . One pull , one step , and he is safe from work and denial . During the following , standing almost in the doorway , he is drawing the garment toward him .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p><stage>To GOODKIND</stage>I 'm glad you dropped in tonight , because I 've been intending to call on you , but there 's so much to do here —<stage>The coat comes off the rack , and with it , the umbrella , which falls with a crash . Both men rise , discovering MACK , coat in hand .</stage>Hello ! I thought you 'd gone .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MACK</speaker>
     <p>No ; I — I — wanted ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>You wanted my coat .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MACK</speaker>
     <p><stage>Advancing with a glad smile of pretended relief that DANIEL has found the simple explanation</stage>Yes ... that 's what I wanted to ask you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>I 'm so glad you said so .<stage>MACK shows surprise .</stage>Because , if you had n't and I had n't understood , you might have been tempted to take it without asking — and then you 'd 've been so sorry and ashamed . A man could n't come into another man 's house , and be welcomed , and then take the other man 's coat , without losing his self-respect ... could he ? And , of course , if we 're going to pull ourselves together , and get out of a hole , we must keep our self-respect .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MACK</speaker>
     <p>I would n't steal ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>You could n't .... It 's your coat .... You asked for it , and I gave it to you .... When you 've worn it ... into a good job ... come back and help me give another to someone who needs it as you do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MACK</speaker>
     <p>I will .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Of course you will .<stage>Helps him into the coat , and then shakes his hand .</stage>Good-night .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MACK</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hesitates , amazed</stage>Good-night .<stage>DANIEL turns L ., and with a gesture expressive of the conviction that this man is mad , MACK exits .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>Well , I 'll be damned !<stage>DANIEL laughs</stage>He wo n't come back ! Not one in ten would come back !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>All right !... That coat cost twenty dollars . If one in ten does come back , we 've made a man for two hundred dollars . Is n't it worth the price ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>Maybe ... if a man 's got the price ! Have you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Like our friend ... that 's what I wanted to ask you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>It 's not what I wanted to ask you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>I 'm rather badly in need of money , and my father ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>Your father understood you well enough to leave you only an income . I foolishly turned over some of the principal , and , in three months , you threw away twenty thousand dollars . You could have had a big salary , and you threw that away . You 're an utter damned waster — if you 're no worse !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>What do you mean ... worse ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>You 'll soon find out what I mean ! You 've had my son 's wife down here , have n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Once or twice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>Or three times ... or a dozen ! He knows !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>I 've asked her not to come again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>And he 's asked her ... but she 's coming when she likes . She says so . Because she 's in love with you .... God knows what women see in your kind of man ! There was Pearl Hennig ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Please !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>Oh , my son told me ! And I hear ... in the neighborhood ... that you 've worse women than that running here ! Women of the streets !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Not many . They 're welcome , but they do n't come .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>Well , that 's your business ! And if your neighbors get sick of having a resort of this kind in their midst , and drive you out , that 's your business ! But my son 's wife ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Is her business !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>And his ! Only Jerry 's in no condition to settle the matter ! He 's broken down from worry and overwork , and you 're partly responsible , and that puts it up to me ! You can take this as a final warning ! If you see Clare again , I 'll act , and I 'll act quick ! That 's all ! Good-night !<stage>He gathers up his coat and hat , and crosses to the door .</stage></p>

     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>Help ... whom ? Strikers , and street women , and general riff-raff ! And you do n't even help them ... because nobody can !

    </sp>

     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>If you believe it ... you are .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>I guess believin ’ ai n't never goin ’ to make me dance .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>You can n't tell ... if you believe hard enough .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY MARGARET</speaker>
     <p>That 's what you said before , and I 've tried , but , somehow , it do n't work .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>That 's the very time to go on . If we stop , just because it do n't work , that is n't faith .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY MARGARET</speaker>
     <p>No ; I s'pose not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>And faith moves mountains . Once upon a time there was a woman who 'd been sick twelve years .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY MARGARET</speaker>
     <p>What was the matter with her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know . But there was a Man in that city who said He could even make the dead rise . And everybody laughed at Him ... as they would today . But the woman did n't laugh , and one morning , when He was passing her house , she got up and followed Him ... just to touch the hem of His cloak . And what do you think ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY MARGARET</speaker>
     <p>I duno .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>She was cured . And the Man said ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY MARGARET</speaker>
     <p>Oh , now , I know . “ Thy faith hath made thee whole . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>That 's right .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY MARGARET</speaker>
     <p>Could God do that for me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Why not ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY MARGARET</speaker>
     <p>It would be an awful big favor .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>But if He does n't , you must go on . If faith does n't heal our hurts , it helps us to bear them . And that 's almost the same thing , is n't it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY MARGARET</speaker>
     <p><stage>Doubtfully</stage>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Like believing you 're Cinderella .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY MARGARET</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>We can n't decide what we want , and then be angry and doubtful because it does n't happen our way . Because , all the time it 's happening His way . The only thing we can be sure of is that He knows what 's best .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY MARGARET</speaker>
     <p>That 's right .... You mean , if God wants me to be well , some day He 'll make me well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>If you believe hard enough .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY MARGARET</speaker>
     <p>And if He do n't ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Then that 's right ... if you believe hard enough .</p>

     <p>He 's been drinking ... more and more ! And , of course , there 've been women ... from the beginning ! All kinds of women ! That woman , salesgirls , stenographers , women of our own class ! Do you remember ... in your church ... a Mrs. Thornbury ? He 's been quite open about her ! Tonight we were going out to dinner ! He came to my room ... drunk ... and babbled that he 'd refused to go until she was invited ! Then I refused to go , and he accused me ... of you ... and struck me with his fist !</p>

     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>He accused ... you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>Yes . And then he tried to take me in his arms ! Night after night he 's come to me ... drunk ... and held me in his arms . And I said once there was nothing more degrading than poverty ! In the past two years I 've learned what degradation means ! I 've come to see your way at last ! I 've come to realize that the material things are nothing , and that love is all ! It is n't too late ?</p>

     <p>It 's never too late !</p>

He said so tonight ! And he 'll do it , too ! The strange thing about Jerry is that , with his mind going , and his health gone , he still gets what he wants ! Take me away , and “ we 'll have five or six rooms , and each other ! ”</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>And I 'm praying to God , with all my strength , to save us from the other half !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>For what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>For you ... and HIM ... and for MY PEOPLE .<stage>Off R ., very softly , as she goes down the hall , MARY MARGARET is heard singing “ I 'm a Pilgrim ; I 'm a Stranger . ”</stage>For the little girl out there .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>And for them you 'd send me back to degradation ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>That little girl 's known degradation that you and I will never know . And she 's singing . Her constant companions are poverty and pain . And she 's singing . She 's crippled . She may never walk again . And still she can say God 's will be done . She believes in me . I can n't disappoint her and the rest . I 'm going on with my job , and you 're going back to yours !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>You mean to Jerry ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>You think that 's God 's will ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>I know it 's your job . You took it with your eyes open . It 's up to you to see it through .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>Must I go on forever paying for one mistake ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Somebody must pay for our mistakes . That it was wrong to make a bargain does n't make it right to break the bargain when we get tired of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know what to do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Play the game . Go back to that poor , mistaken man lying across the foot of your bed — his mind going and his health gone . Bear your punishment and help him to bear his . That 's your duty !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>Duty ! Duty !! What about happiness ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>There is no other happiness . Oh , do n't you see , my dear , that 's been your great mistake ? You 're always crying — you and the world — “ I want to be happy ! ” Happiness is service ! Happiness is clean-living , and clear-thinking , and self-forgetfulness , and self-respect !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>And love ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Love is n't all . Not the love you mean . You said : “ Take me , and we 'll both forget . ” Could we have forgotten promises unkept , faith disappointed , aspirations unrealized ? No , my dear , love is n't all ; nor even happiness . There 's something bigger , and better , and more important , and that something is ... DUTY !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>The world does n't think that !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>That 's what 's wrong with the world !<stage>A pause .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>You want me to go back ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>I want you to be right !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>Well , then ... I 'm going through . I 'm going back , and play the game ... with you in my heart always . You do n't forbid that , do you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>You are in mine always .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CLARE</speaker>
     <p>And this is n't good-bye . Sometime ... somewhere ... in this world ... or out of it ... there must be a moment ... and a place ... to retrieve mistakes .... Good-night .</p>

     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Clare ... good-night .<stage>She takes his hand . Then she exits . The outer door slams . Then a cab door ... faintly . He sinks ... tired with the effort of renunciation . Afterward he comes down , slowly , and drops on the bench in front of the table . MARY MARGARET enters , singing “ I 'm a Pilgrim , ” in a higher key , to march tempo , keeping time with her crutches . She is down R. when she sees DANIEL .</stage></p>

     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Yes . It 's stupid ... and instinctive . I 've noticed we 're inclined to blame a man for a pug nose ... if ours is Roman . Some day we 'll get over the idea that all who differ from us are villains , and that we should hate each other instead of trying to understand each other .

    <stage>Two men have climbed upon the table , and suddenly seize UMANSKI from behind . Momentarily , they bear him down , and this obstacle is removed . As they drag him up R ., the rest of the gang closes in from all sides , hiding Daniel , who is forced up stage C. The table is overturned . Above the struggling mass are seen fists striking down , various improvised weapons in action . A Dockman , who , at JOE 'S speech , has lifted the bench from behind DANIEL , to fell him with it , and whose weapon has been seized , from the rear , by the HENCHLEYS , pommels madly . Above the pandemonium are distinguished voices — PEARL : “ Help ! ” UMANSKI : “ I kill somebody ! ” MISS LEVINSON : “ Police ! ” GOODKIND : “ Let him alone ! ” Suddenly UMANSKI throws off his captors , and , attacking the mob from in front , mows his way through , tossing them to left and right . When a way is cleared , he ... and we ... see DANIEL , senseless , lying in the overturned table , a tiny trickle of blood running down his face , his head supported by the table-leg R. UMANSKI gives a deep groan of rage and pity . Hearing this and divining that something dreadful has happened to her hero , MARY MARGARET , who has ceased praying , and raised herself to her feet by the aid of a neighboring chair , walks down to L. C. Before she sees DANIEL , MISS LEVINSON sees her , and emits a piercing scream .</stage>

     <stage>SCENE : Gilchrist 's Room — “ Upstairs . ” Two months later .</stage>
     <stage>The room is cheerful . That is its chief aspect . Cheerful , and comfortable , and homelike . Such a room ... in the rear of the fourth story ... might be had anywhere for seven dollars a week , and its contents duplicated for a couple of hundred , yet no one should be able to look in without envying the occupant . Before the warm glow of a fireplace down R. is a big , brown leather-covered armchair . An electric lamp stands on a table stage left of the chair and squarely opposite the fireplace . There are books on the table , too , and writing things , and another chair on its left . Above the grate a picture of Christ in the Temple . Conspicuous in the flat , and visible from all parts of the house , a big studio window . There are cream-colored outside curtains , and brown denim inside curtains , drawn now , but when they are pulled aside , one sees chimney-pots , and roof-tops , and a blue night-sky , with one particularly bright star . Up L ., a curtained arch into a hall bedroom , and down L. a door . The walls , covered with old-gold grass-cloth , are hidden , to a height of six feet , by roughly-built bookcases , filled with much-used books . A sofa , against the wall L ., now holds numerous packages . There is a brown-and-tan grass rug on the floor , and there may be a window seat , with brown cushions , beneath the window . The furniture is all old ... probably second-hand ... but , as aforesaid , the room suggests comfort and peace .</stage>

     <speaker>AT RISE : It is just after eight o'clock , Christmas Eve ,</speaker>
     <p>1920 . DANIEL is discovered , dreaming , in the armchair R ., a pipe in his mouth and his face to the fire . He has not lighted the desk lamp , and , except for the glow of the embers , the room is in darkness . Hanging over the left arm of the chair , DANIEL 'S hand holds a magazine , but he has not begun reading . After a pause long enough for the audience to take in his surroundings , there is a light tap at the door and , without waiting for a response , MARY MARGARET enters . She walks without crutches — quite briskly — but plainly is on some secret business . Daniel is lost in the darkness . A package in her hand , MARY MARGARET crosses quickly to the table , and turns on one and then the other of the two lights in the lamp . Instantly , of course , she sees the figure in the chair , and conceals the package beneath her apron .</p>

     <p>You do n't want my advice ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>I want you ... as general manager . These strikes are such utter damned waste ! We had a working compromise on your agreement , and everything was all right , but we began figuring we could make more money ... and the men walked out , and flooded the mines . I 'd like you to take charge , Daniel .</p>

     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>I can n't .</p>

     <p>I do n't want anything .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>You want to see the men get their rights .</p>

     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>They 'll get ‘ em . Nothing can stop that .</p>

     <p>You 're not going to turn down fifty thousand dollars a year ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>What can I buy with it that I have n't got ?</p>

     <p>What can you buy with fifty ——</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>What have you bought ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>I 've got one of the finest houses in New York !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Is it any more comfortable than this ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>This one little room !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>How many rooms do you live in at the same time ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>I 've got half a dozen cars !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>I 've two legs , and I walk , and keep well .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>I 've twenty servants ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Do n't tell me you enjoy that !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>And the respect of people about me ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>So have I !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>And , what 's most important of all , I 'm a success !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Are you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>Huh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Are you ? What is success ? Money ? Yes ; that 's what our civilization tells us . Money ! But where has that brought us ? Only to the elevation of the unfit ... the merely shrewd and predatory . All around us we see men of wealth who have nothing else ... neither health nor happiness nor love nor respect . Men who can get no joy out of books , or pictures , or music , or even themselves . Tired , worried men who are afraid to quit because they have no resource except to make money — money with which to buy vulgar excitement for their own debased souls . Why , Mr. Goodkind , I have an income that you would n't suggest to your bookkeeper , but I have peace , and health , and friends , and time to read , and think , and dream , and help . Which of us is the rich man ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>But if everybody lived your way , what would become of the world 's work ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Living that way is my contribution to the world 's work . Another man 's might be selling shoes , or writing plays , or digging ditches . Doing his job does n't prevent any man from doing his bit . “ From every man according to his ability , to every man according to his needs . ” And every man who gives his best must find his happiness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p>I 'm afraid there would n't be much progress ... living your way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>That 's the second time you 've spoken of my way . It is n't my way . It 's the sum total of all that has been learned and taught . You , and Jerry , and the others have called me eccentric , and a fool , because I 'm trying to walk a path trod hard by countless feet . Was Christ eccentric ? Was Confucius a fool ? And how about Buddha and Mohammed ? What of St. Bernard , and St. Teresa , and St. Francis of Assisi — of Plato , and Zeno , and Lincoln , and Emerson , and Florence Nightingale , and Father Damien , and Octavia Hill , and all the saints and scientists , and poets and philosophers , who have lived and died in complete forgetfulness of self ? Were they fools , or were they wise men and women who had found the way to peace and happiness ? Were they failures , or were they the great successes of all Time and all Eternity ?</p>

    <stage>JERRY enters ... a dying man . He drags his legs with difficulty , and his speech is thick , but he is still cynical and defiant .</stage>

     <speaker>JERRY</speaker>
     <p>Well , you 've been the devil of a time ! I came up to see what was keeping you !</p>

     <p>Not so damned well ! But I 'll be all right in the Spring ! Clare 's looking after me . Clare 's a good sport . What I need now 's a run down to Palm Beach !<stage>Looks around</stage>So you 're reduced to this , are you ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>JERRY</speaker>
     <p>Yes ... so do I ! Did n't I always say you were a nut ? That 's it ; a nut !<stage>He laughs with a laugh that begins to get the better of him .</stage></p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p><stage>Crossing rapidly to the door</stage>Come , Jerry !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>A light rap ; GOODKIND opens . Enter MARY MARGARET . She glances at him and crosses to upper L. C. JERRY looks at her , and turns back to DAN .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JERRY</speaker>
     <p>Who 's the girl ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANIEL</speaker>
     <p>Your father 's waiting .</p>

     <speaker>JERRY</speaker>
     <p>A ’ right !...<stage>Crosses L .</stage>Some failure you 've made out of life !<stage>Turns back and leers at MARY MARGARET . In the doorway , looks at DAN .</stage>Wheels ... by God ! Wheels !<stage>He laughs , and exits .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOODKIND</speaker>
     <p><stage>Goes to DAN and takes his hand</stage>I wonder if you 're the failure , after all .<stage>Returns to the door .</stage>Good-night !<stage>He exits .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DAN takes his pipe from his pocket and puts it in his mouth . Some chimes , in the distance , begin the anthem “ Hark the Herald Angels Sing . ” DANIEL goes up , draws back the curtains , and throws open the window . MARY MARGARET , feeling the fresh air , draws her furs about her , happily . She turns up . DANIEL is standing with his left arm akimbo . MARY MARGARET slips her head through it , and nestles to him . They ... and we ... see the chimney pots , and the blue night sky , and one bright star .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY MARGARET</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Gilchrist ! Is that the Star of Bethlehem ?</p>
