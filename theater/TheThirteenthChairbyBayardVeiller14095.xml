   <head>ACT I</head>
   <stage>The SCENE is the Italian Room in ROSCOE CROSBY 'S Home in New York . It is a handsome room . A plan of the setting will be found at the end of the play . As the curtain rises Miss HELEN O'NEILL and WILLIAM CROSBY are discovered standing R. C . They are in each other 's arms , and the rising curtain discloses them as they kiss . The window blinds are drawn .</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . I love you so .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . You are the most wonderful thing in all the world .</stage>
   <stage>( She gives a little laugh and moves away from him a step right . )</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . I can n't believe it .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . That I love you ?</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . Oh , no , I 'm sure of that .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . If there 's any doubt in your mind , I 'll prove it again .</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . They 'll see us . ( He takes her in his arms again and kisses her . She laughs happily . And then turning a little stands with her cheek pressed against his . ) Oh , my dear , my dear !</stage>
   <stage>( MRS. CROSBY , a fashionably dressed and extremely attractive woman , enters from door down L. She closes the door . She stops for a moment and watches the lovers and then with a little laugh comes toward them . MRS. CROSBY is fifty-five and looks ten years younger . She has charm , beauty and kindliness . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY ( coming to C. a step ) . Do n't move , you look so comfortable ! ( They separate quickly . ) Well , are you happy ? ( To R. C . )</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Oh , mother !</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . Happy !</stage>
   <stage>( MRS. CROSBY crosses to HELEN , pats her hand and stands between WILLIAM and HELEN R. C . )</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Shall we tell ‘ em all ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY . Tell them ? ( She laughs . ) What do you think they are ? Blind and deaf ? It 's been a perfectly wonderful dinner . You were so blind to everything but each other . Oh , Billy , I thought your father would have a fit .</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . I thought he had an awful cold , he was coughing terribly .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY . Coughing ? He nearly choked to keep from laughing . I told him I 'd send him from the table if he laughed at you .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Why you never spoke to him once .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY . Child , explain to him that wives do n't have to — Oh , I forget you have n't learned that yet . You know , Billy , I can talk to your father very effectively without words .</stage>
   <stage>( Crosses to below table R .)</stage>
   <stage>HELEN ( turning to MRS. CROSBY ) . Mrs. Crosby —</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Mother , Nell 's all fussed up because we 've got money . She thinks you 'll think — I 'm — what in novels they call marrying beneath me .</stage>
   <stage>( He and MRS. CROSBY laugh . HELEN looks a little hurt . )</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . Well , he is .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY . Nonsense , child , do n't be silly . ( Sits down stage end of table . )</stage>
   <stage>HELEN ( moving a step to MRS. CROSBY ) . It 's not silly , Mrs. Crosby . Everyone will say it , and they 'll be right .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Let 's settle this thing now once and for all , then . In the first place it 's all nonsense , and in the second it is n't true —</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . Oh , yes , it is .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY . Oh , the first row ! I 'll settle this one . Nelly !</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Now then , Nell , out with it , get it all out of your system .</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . In the first place , it 's the money .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY . Yes , but — Helen —</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . Please , let me say it all . You have social position , great wealth , charming friends , everything that makes life worth — Oh , what 's the use ? You know as well as I do the great difference between us , and —</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY . My dear child , suppose we admit all that , what then ?</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . But do n't you see —</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM ( embracing her in front of table R .) . You little idiot ! I do n't see anything but you .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY . You love each other , that 's the whole of it , children . Suppose you listen to an old woman .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Old ! Huh !</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY . Well , old enough . If Billy was the usual rich man 's son it might be different . There might be something in what you say . But thank God he is n't . Mind you , I do n't say he was n't like most of them when he was younger . I dare say he was , I know he went to supper with a chorus girl once .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Twice .</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . What was she like ?</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Like a chorus girl .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY . The trouble with you , my dear , is that you 've been reading novels . When Billy 's father married me , I was a school teacher , and he was a clerk . We did n't have any money , but we were awfully in love — we still rather like each other . Now just for the sake of argument , suppose we should have acted like stern parents , what would be the use ? Billy 's in business for himself , he 's making his own money , he can marry when he wants to and as he wants to , and if you want my real opinion , I do n't mind confessing that I think he 's pretty lucky to get you .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . There !</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . But you know so little about me .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Oh , rot !</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY ( to WILLIAM ) . Thank you , Billy . I was trying to think of an effective word . ( To HELEN . ) You 've been my private secretary for over a year , and no matter how much my looks belie it , I 'm not a bit of a fool . I know a great deal about you .</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . My family —</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM ( C .) . I 'm not marrying your family !</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . I 'm afraid you are .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Oh !</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . There 's only mother .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY ( rising and moving to HELEN 'S side in front of table R .) . Oh , my dear , forgive me . Your mother should have been here to-night .</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . No , my mother — Mrs. Crosby — mother does n't go out — she 'd be unhappy here , and you 'd be uncomfortable if she came . You 'll find her trying sometimes , you 'll think she 's common . Oh , do n't misunderstand me . She 's the most wonderful mother in the world . And she 's —</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY . Suppose , my dear , that we take your mother for granted . ( She crosses to a position between WILLIAM and HELEN . ) Take us as you find us and we will try to be happy .</stage>
   <stage>( Enter CROSBY from door L. He is a fine-looking man of about sixty , with a pleasant personality , a good deal of charm and that masterful self-possession which sometimes marks the man of affairs . It is always evident that the most delightful intimacy exists between himself and his wife . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY . Well , Roscoe ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( moves to L. C . ) . Welcome , my dear . ( HELEN crosses to him and he takes her in his arms . )</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . Oh , Mr. Crosby — I —</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( placing HELEN L. of him with arm still around her , reaching his other hand to WILLIAM ) . Bill , shake !</stage>
   <stage>( Father and son shake hands . )</stage>
   <stage>( CROSBY looks at his wife and they laugh gently . )</stage>
   <stage>Shall I tell ‘ em ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY ( standing in front of table over R .) . I would .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM ( R. C . ) Tell us what ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( C .) . You did this just in time . To-morrow I was going to forbid you to have anything more to do with this young woman .</stage>
   <stage>HELEN ( L. of CROSBY ) . You see !</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . What for ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Your mother and I felt that you were pretty slow with your love-making —</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Oh , mother !</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( continuing ) .— and I knew darned well that if I interfered , you 'd take the girl out and marry her .</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . Oh !</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . You old schemer !</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( crossing over R. C . below MRS. CROSBY ) . I bet it would have worked .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM ( as CROSBY crosses R. WILLIAM slaps him on the back ) . It would . ( Crosses behind HELEN to L. C . )</stage>
   <stage>( The door down L. opens and EDWARD WALES enters . )</stage>
   <stage>WALES . I came ahead of the others to tell you —</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Why , Ned , old man , you came just in time to congratulate them . ( He points toward WILLIAM and HELEN . )</stage>
   <stage>WALES . On what ? ( L. C . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY . They 're going to be married : is n't it fine ?</stage>
   <stage>WALES . Oh !</stage>
   <stage>( There is a long pause . )</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . You do n't congratulate us , Mr. Wales .</stage>
   <stage>WALES . No , Will , I do n't . I 'm not sure that I can . ( Down stage a step . )</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Why , Ned ?</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . I 'm afraid that calls for an explanation .</stage>
   <stage>WALES . Yes , I expect that it does .</stage>
   <stage>( There is a long pause . )</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Well ?</stage>
   <stage>WALES . I 'm sorry , but I can n't explain anything until to-morrow .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY . But really , Mr. Wales , do n't you think —</stage>
   <stage>WALES . I think my action is almost indefensible . I 'm admitting that . But I have very good reasons for what I am doing . ( He turns to CROSBY . ) Roscoe , I 've been your close friend for a great many years . You 've trusted me and believed in me . I 'm going to ask you to wait . After all , twenty-four hours can n't make any difference , and it may save you all a great deal of unhappiness .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM ( coming to WALES a step ) . This is intolerable .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Ned , I can n't understand —</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Father , this is my affair .</stage>
   <stage>WALES . I 'm sorry .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Sorry ? I should think you would be .</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . Billy , I told you what would happen . Mr. Wales , I do n't know what you have discovered . But it 's nothing of which I am ashamed , nothing .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Dear , you must n't mind what he says .</stage>
   <stage>HELEN ( crossing in front of WILLIAM and moving a few steps towards WALES ) . Oh , but I do , I can n't bear it . Why , my mother is the most wonderful woman in the world . I wo n't have her attacked . Do you know what she did ? When I was ten years old she sent me away from her . I was the one thing she had in the world to love and she gave me up because she thought — because she thought it was the best thing she could do for me . I was sent to a fine school , then to college , and then when I was nineteen , quite by accident , I found out that she was n't dead , as they 'd always told me , and when I went to her all she said was , “ Well , my dear , I wanted to make a lady of you . ”</stage>
   <stage>( Turns to WILLIAM C. He takes her in his arms , then HELEN moves over to R. of him . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY ( in front of table R .) . I think she succeeded , my dear .</stage>
   <stage>WALES ( L. C . ) . Miss O'Neill , I did n't even know that you had a mother .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM ( C .) . Then you 'd better tell us now whatever your objection is .</stage>
   <stage>WALES . I can tell you nothing until to-morrow . ( He turns to WILLIAM . ) Billy , I 'd rather be shot than do what I 'm doing . If I 'm wrong I 'll come to you gladly and eat dirt . I 'll beg this young lady 's pardon , on my knees if she likes . ( Voices and laughter heard off L .) Now that 's all I 'm going to say about it until then . ( Moves up L .)</stage>
   <stage>( The door L. opens . MARY EASTWOOD , HELEN TRENT , ELIZABETH ERSKINE , GRACE STANDISH , HOWARD STANDISH , PHILIP MASON and BRADDISH TRENT enter laughing and talking . )</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD ( at L. C . To crowd in doorway ) . And he said whose wife ?</stage>
   <stage>( All laugh . )</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM ( C. HELEN in front of table R .) . Quiet , quiet , everybody . I 've got a surprise for you .</stage>
   <stage>( From the people at the door come laughter and buzz of conversation . )</stage>
   <stage>Nellie and I are going to be married .</stage>
   <stage>( Girls rush C. and congratulate HELEN . Men and WILLIAM L. C . Business ad lib ., congratulating him . )</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD ( coming to WILLIAM C .) . If you had n't been engaged to her , she could have you arrested for the way you made eyes at her at dinner , Billy . But of course , if people will marry — why — ( She turns away R .) I hope you will be awfully happy . ( Crosses to MR. and MRS. CROSBY down R .)</stage>
   <stage>MISS ERSKINE ( coming to WILLIAM ) . Is n't it beautiful ? ( Moves up to L. of chesterfield sofa . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. TRENT ( crossing to WILLIAM and kissing him ) . I 'm glad , Billy , glad .</stage>
   <stage>( Moves over to STANDISH , who is down L. with TRENT . MISS STANDISH moves to front of table R .)</stage>
   <stage>( WILLIAM and HELEN look around — see that no one is paying attention to them — WILLIAM sneaks up to door R. C ., opens it and he and HELEN exit quickly . MRS. CROSBY , MR. CROSBY and MISS EASTWOOD are in front of the table R. C . TRENT , STANDISH , MRS. TRENT , MASON talking together over L. WALES up L. Conversation ad lib . until MISS EASTWOOD speaks . )</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD ( to MRS. CROSBY ) . Marriage is such an awful gamble . I know a girl who tried it four times . Billy , I do hope you — ( Turning to C ., where WILLIAM was standing . ) Why , they are gone !</stage>
   <stage>( Laughter and buzz of conversation ad lib . )</stage>
   <stage>( Miss EASTWOOD runs up to door R. C ., opens it — looks in dining-room — gives a scream — closes door quickly , comes to right end of chesterfield . TRENT goes to console table L. of chesterfield , gets cigarette , lights it , and crosses to C. back of chesterfield in front of fireplace . STANDISH and MRS. TRENT move to table L. of chesterfield . WALES and MISS ERSKINE sit on chesterfield facing audience up C. MRS. CROSBY is still at upper end of table R. CROSBY talks with MISS EASTWOOD . MASON is the L. end of the chesterfield facing the audience . )</stage>
   <stage>( Enter BUTLER from down L .)</stage>
   <stage>BUTLER . Mrs. Crosby , the person you sent the car for has arrived .</stage>
   <stage>( All turn eagerly toward him . )</stage>
   <stage>WALES ( rises and moves down L. C . ) . Can we see her now , Mrs. Crosby ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY . Certainly — Pollock , ask Madame la Grange if she will come in , please .</stage>
   <stage>BUTLER . Yes , madame .</stage>
   <stage>( He exits and closes the door after him . )</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD ( coming down between the large table and the chesterfield ) . I 'm perfectly thrilled . Do you suppose she expects to be taken seriously ?</stage>
   <stage>MISS ERSKINE . Of course .</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD ( at table R .) . How funny ! If you do n't laugh at her , we can have no end of fun . I 'll guy her terribly and she 'll never know it .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY ( at table R .) . Oh , I would n't do that , Mary . She may be quite in earnest .</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD . Oh , I can n't believe that . Madame la Grange ! I can see her now . Tall , black-haired creature , regular adventuress , see if she is n't . Is n't she , Mr. Wales ?</stage>
   <stage>WALES ( in front of chesterfield ) . She 's the most remarkable woman I have ever known .</stage>
   <stage>( Enter BUTLER from door L ., coming well on stage ) .</stage>
   <stage>BUTLER . Madame la Grange .</stage>
   <stage>( Enter MADAME ROSALIE LA GRANGE . She is a woman of about fifty . She speaks with a marked French accent . )</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Good evening everybody . ( The men all rise . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY . How do you do , Madame la Grange ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . I am well , I thank you , madame .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY . Do come in .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Thank you , madame . ( She sees WALES L. C ., and goes to him . ) Good evening , Mister Wales . It was kind of you to send the motor-car for me .</stage>
   <stage>WALES . We wanted you to be comfortable .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . And I was . ( She laughs and turns to MRS. CROSBY R. C . ) Do you know , madame , when the gentleman in uniform come for me , I thought at first it was a policeman .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY . I hope you were n't frightened .</stage>
   <stage>( The positions now are : ROSALIE C ., CROSBY R. end of chesterfield C. MRS. TRENT and STANDISH have moved down L. TRENT comes to L. of arm-chair . Miss ERSKINE seated on chesterfield up C. MRS. CROSBY at table R. WALES L. C . and MASON L. C . )</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Oh , no , madame . I should like to see the policeman that could frighten me . They are nice boys , the policemen .</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD ( on the R. side of ROSALIE ) . Mr. Wales tells us you are wonderful .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . All women are .</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD ( with a meaning glance at the others ) . So you tell fortunes ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . No , mademoiselle , I do not . I get messages from those of us that ‘ ave passed on . I do not ‘ old at all with the cards nor tea-leaves nor any of those tricks .</stage>
   <stage>( All laugh — MISS EASTWOOD loudest . )</stage>
   <stage>Once in a while I give advice . ( She turns to MISS EASTWOOD . ) If I was you , mademoiselle , I would not meet Jimmy at the Ritz at three o'clock tohYpppHeNmorrow .</stage>
   <stage>( All laugh . MISS STANDISH crosses to chesterfield C. and sits . Miss ERSKINE rises and crosses to table R. and sits in arm-chair upper end . MASON moves up and sits on up stage chesterfield . TRENT goes to L. end of chesterfield . MISS EASTWOOD is in front of table R. ROSALIE goes to WALES L. C . CROSBY seats MRS. CROSBY down stage end of table R ., then crosses back of MISS ERSKINE to upper end of table . )</stage>
   <stage>Well , sir , and how are you ?</stage>
   <stage>WALES . We 're expecting great things from you to-night , Madame la Grange .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Bien ! I hope you will not be disappointed .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( above table R ., coming C. a step ) . I suppose there are a lot of tricks that —</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( interrupting him ) . I suppose mine is the only trade in the world in which there are tricks , eh , monsieur ?</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD ( coming to ROSALIE C .) . Why should n't I meet Jimmy at the Ritz to-morrow ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . If you do , something awful may ‘ appen to ‘ im .</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD . What ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . If you keep meeting Jimmy ‘ e may marry you .</stage>
   <stage>( MISS EASTWOOD moves up stage a step . )</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( upper end of table R .) . Would you mind telling me how you know this young lady was going to meet Jimmy at the Ritz to-morrow afternoon ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . She did leave ‘ is letter in ‘ er bag in the ‘ all , and while I wait I ‘ ave read it .</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD ( C .) . How did you know it was my bag ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . The stuff of the bag matches the stuff of your dress .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY ( seated below table R .) . Then it is all trickery ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . It is , madame , and it is not . I tell you , madame , most of the time it is tricks , with even the best of us . But there ‘ ave been times in my life when it was not tricks . There ‘ ave been things I could not understand myself , messages from them that ‘ ave passed on , madame . There is a power — a wonderful power — that come to us . But you never can tell when it is coming . And if you waited for it you would starve to death . So when it is not there we use tricks .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY ( seated at lower end of table at R .) . I think I understand .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Do you , madame ? I thought you would .</stage>
   <stage>( She moves to and puts her hand-bag on the table R. MRS. TRENT , seated below door down L ., is joined by WALES . MASON is standing in front of the fireplace . )</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD ( coming to R. C . ) . Do n't you think all this is dishonest !</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( in front of table R ., turning to her ) . What is dishonest in it ?</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD . Tricking a lot of poor ignorant people .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . It is all in the way you look at it . A widow woman came to me this mornin ’ with a breaking ‘ eart for the man that was gone . I went into a trance and Laughing Eyes , my spirit control , came with a message from ‘ im . She said ‘ e was in heaven with the angels , and there was no cold nor ‘ unger ; and the streets were paved with gold , and there was music and ‘ appiness everywhere . She told ‘ er he was thinking of ‘ er every day and every hour and watching and waiting for the day she would come to ‘ im . Now was n't that worth fifty cents of any woman 's money ? And the man may be in ‘ ell for all I know !</stage>
   <stage>TRENT ( L. C . by arm-chair ) . What I can n't understand is why you are telling us all this .</stage>
   <stage>( MISS EASTWOOD moves to the chesterfield C .)</stage>
   <stage>MRS. TRENT ( seated over L. by door ) . If we know you are fooling —</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( going to TRENT ) . Did not Mr. Wales tell you ?</stage>
   <stage>WALES ( L. C . ) . I 've told them nothing .</stage>
   <stage>( MASON drops down R. of chesterfield , STANDISH down L. CROSBY is R. end of chesterfield C .)</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( C .) . Well , tell them now , if you please , sir . ( Moves to and sits upper end of table and takes off her gloves . )</stage>
   <stage>WALES ( down L .) . As I told you some time ago , Madame la Grange has done a lot of things that we can n't explain — - when I asked her to come here to-night , she said she would under certain conditions .</stage>
   <stage>MASON ( between chesterfield and table ) . You mean test conditions ?</stage>
   <stage>WALES . Not exactly . What she said was that no money should pass between us , and that whatever she did , she would be honest .</stage>
   <stage>MASON ( very eagerly , and moving towards ROSALIE ) . You mean that you wo n't play any tricks ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . If I do , I will tell you .</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD ( seated on chesterfield C .) . Of course we understand all about spirit rappings .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . You do , eh ?</stage>
   <stage>STANDISH ( down L .) . Well , rather .</stage>
   <stage>( CROSBY sits R. end of chesterfield . )</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Well , well , what do you think of that ?</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD . You have to be near a table or something like that and —</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Maybe a chair or a desk would do ?</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD . And then in the dark —</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . But of course in the dark . And you get one rap for yes and two raps for no . ( There is a short pause . ROSALIE rises , comes down C. and says :) Are those spirits near ?</stage>
   <stage>( All laugh . )</stage>
   <stage>STANDISH . Oh , no , do n't .</stage>
   <stage>( One rap is heard from the back of the fireplace . )</stage>
   <stage>( Little laugh . )</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD . But — ( Rising and coming down L. C . a step . )</stage>
   <stage>MASON . Oh , please keep still —</stage>
   <stage>( They gather a little closer around ROSALIE . )</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Is it Laughing Eyes ?</stage>
   <stage>( One rap is heard — still louder . )</stage>
   <stage>And you cannot talk to me in the light ?</stage>
   <stage>( One rap . )</stage>
   <stage>Are you ‘ appy ?</stage>
   <stage>( MRS. TRENT rises . )</stage>
   <stage>( Two raps again . )</stage>
   <stage>Is there someone here you do not like ?</stage>
   <stage>( One rap . )</stage>
   <stage>A gentleman ?</stage>
   <stage>( Two raps . )</stage>
   <stage>Dear , dear , a lady ?</stage>
   <stage>( One rap . )</stage>
   <stage>( She points to MISS EASTWOOD . )</stage>
   <stage>Is it that one ?</stage>
   <stage>( One rap . )</stage>
   <stage>Laughing Eyes she do not like you .</stage>
   <stage>( General laugh . )</stage>
   <stage>MASON ( R. C . ) . That 's the most wonderful thing I ever heard .</stage>
   <stage>STANDISH ( down L .) . Oh , I do n't think —</stage>
   <stage>MASON . It could n't be a trick . She just stood there . I watched her hands every minute .</stage>
   <stage>( TRENT goes to arm-chair L. C . )</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . You did watch the wrong end of me . I ‘ ave a wooden sole in my shoe . ( She lifts her skirt and shows that she has taken one foot from her slipper . ) You do it with your foot . Like this . ( Laughingly . ) It is a trick .</stage>
   <stage>( MISS EASTWOOD goes to WALES L. C . MRS. TRENT moves up to armchair L. C . STANDISH up to L. end of chesterfield , and then by the back of chesterfield to R. C ., CROSBY C. MRS. CROSBY is seated at table R .)</stage>
   <stage>MASON ( R. C . ) . Then if we get any messages —</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . If you get any messages ? Well , sir , I am telling you the truth now . Most of the time it is a fake . With me as with the others . But to-night there will be no fake . I am a stranger to all of you except to Mr. Wales . I do not know who live in this ‘ ouse . I do not know the name of any one of you . Mr. Wales told me he wanted me to come ‘ ere , he said he would send for me . ( Moves to R. end of chesterfield . ) But ‘ e did not tell me one word about any of you ;</stage>
   <stage>WALES ( down L .) . That is quite true .</stage>
   <stage>TRENT ( by arm-chair L. C . ) . You have n't given her a hint of any sort ?</stage>
   <stage>WALES ( L .) . On my word of honour .</stage>
   <stage>MASON ( above table R .) . Madame la Grange .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Yes , sir ?</stage>
   <stage>MASON . I know a man who saw Palladino lift a table just by putting her hands on it .</stage>
   <stage>( ROSALIE points to a small console table R. end of settee — it has a lamp on it . MISS EASTWOOD is at the L. end of chesterfield . )</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( putting hand-bag on chair above table R .) . Will someone please take the lamp off that table ? And will you bring it to me ‘ ere ?</stage>
   <stage>( MISS STANDISH moves to and takes the lamp and holds it . MASON brings console table to ROSALIE who comes down C .— the wide side of the table to audience . ROSALIE puts her hands on table with her thumbs under its edge and lifts the table and turns right and left . )</stage>
   <stage>You mean like that ?</stage>
   <stage>MASON . Yes , I suppose that was it .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . In the dark you would not ‘ ave noticed my thumbs .</stage>
   <stage>( All laugh . Miss ERSKINE is seated at the back of the table over R .)</stage>
   <stage>But it can be done , it can be done . I do not say that I can do it in the light , but if you want I will try .</stage>
   <stage>ALL . Oh , yes , yes , of course , please do — yes , yes !</stage>
   <stage>MASON . You mean without any trickery ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( getting back of console table . Turning table around — narrow side to audience ) . I mean like this .</stage>
   <stage>( She places the tips of the fingers of both hands on the C. of the table and stands rigid for a few moments . No one speaks . All watch her with breathless interest . Slowly the table tips a little to one side , and then tips in the opposite direction . Then it slowly rises about a foot from the floor , and then drops suddenly and falls over . There is a long pause . )</stage>
   <stage>MASON ( R. of small table ) . Good Lord !</stage>
   <stage>WALES ( L. C ., quietly ) . What did I tell you ?</stage>
   <stage>( There is a long pause , all turn towards ROSALIE to see what she will do next . MASON takes console table back to its place to the R. end of the chesterfield . TRENT and MRS. TRENT are over L. STANDISH and CROSBY C .)</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( C .) . Now you all do know what I can do , but I can trick you too ; so you will ‘ ave to take my word for it that I will not . I am not making to you any promises . I will go into the trance for you and it will be the real trance and not a fake . My spirit does control a little girl named Laughing Eyes .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Are you asking us to believe that the spirit of a dead child —</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( C .) . To them that believe there is no death . Your own religion teaches you that .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . But not that the spirits of the dead can come back to earth .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( moves to chair upper end of table R. CROSBY crosses to R. end of chesterfield ) . Monsieur should go and read the Bible . I am not going to argue with any of you . I did not come ‘ ere for argument . Most of you do not believe . You are all of little faith ; it is ‘ ard to get messages then . Perhaps it would be best if I did go . ( Crosses to L. C . STANDISH has moved to the back of table R .)</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY ( at table R .) . Oh , no , please stay .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( after hesitating ) . Madame , I will be glad to .</stage>
   <stage>( WILLIAM and HELEN enter R. C . )</stage>
   <stage>TRENT ( down L. of arm-chair ) . And you 're willing to submit to our conditions ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Of course , anything in reason — I —</stage>
   <stage>HELEN ( coming down R. C . ) . Why !</stage>
   <stage>( At the sound of a new voice ROSALIE turns . She gives a little start , and then moves quickly to HELEN C .)</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Wait ! Something is coming to me . Please — not anyone to speak !</stage>
   <stage>( All laugh . )</stage>
   <stage>( She is close to HELEN and looks at her . ) It is a message . Give me your ‘ and , mademoiselle .</stage>
   <stage>( HELEN in a good deal of confusion gives ROSALIE her hand . ROSALIE stands and holds it . Her eyes are closed . )</stage>
   <stage>There is nothing but ‘ appiness coming to you . The spirits tell me you are the favourite child of fortune .</stage>
   <stage>( WILLIAM comes down to R. C . )</stage>
   <stage>You will ‘ ave wealth and prosperity and ‘ appiness . You will marry the man you love , and you will be ‘ appy all your life ,</stage>
   <stage>( WALES goes up L. TRENT comes to ROSALIE a step . ROSALIE turns to the others . )</stage>
   <stage>There is something I want to tell ‘ er just for ‘ erself . She is so young , we must spare her modesty .</stage>
   <stage>( MRS. TRENT goes up L. TRENT , MISS EASTWOOD , and WALES go up L. C . ROSALIE brings HELEN down L. WILLIAM joins CROSBY and MRS. CROSBY R. MISS ERSKINE and STANDISH are at the back of table R .)</stage>
   <stage>( The following lines are spoken by HELEN and ROSALIE in an undertone . )</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . Mother !</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . My darling , I did not know . They just brought me here . You know I would not ‘ ave come for anything in the world if I ‘ ad known .</stage>
   <stage>( HELEN starts to break away . ROSALIE clutches her . )</stage>
   <stage>Do n't tell them , dear , do n't ‘ ave me shame you before all your wonderful friends . I will go in one minute — I will get away from the ‘ ouse the first minute I can .</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . But , mother , there 's no shame . I 'm proud —</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Tell them afterwards if you must tell them , but let me get away before you do so . ( In her normal voice again . ) Remember now , mademoiselle , all the love in the world is ‘ anging above you and praying for your ‘ appiness . Do not let it go for the love of ‘ Eaven .</stage>
   <stage>( Buzz of conversation . ROSALIE turns to WALES L. HELEN stands looking after her . WILLIAM comes to HELEN B. C . )</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . What did she tell you ?</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . You heard most of it . I 'll tell you the rest later .</stage>
   <stage>( WILLIAM and HELEN go up R. C . )</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . I think I ‘ ad better go from ‘ ere .</stage>
   <stage>( MISS EASTWOOD and TRENT come down L .)</stage>
   <stage>WALES . That 's absurd . ( To the others . ) Madame la Grange wants to call off the seance .</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD ( down L .) . I thought she might .</stage>
   <stage>( MASON above table R .)</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Did you really , miss ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY . Oh , wo n't you please stay ?</stage>
   <stage>( WILLIAM and HELEN R. C . MISS ERSKINE above table R .)</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( coming C .) . I am afraid I cannot , madame . I am not feeling right . I am not just myself , madame .</stage>
   <stage>WALES ( L. C . ) . Really , Madame la Grange ? I 'm afraid under the circumstances —</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( getting hand-bag from chair ) . I am very sorry , but I must go from ‘ ere .</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD ( moving L. of ROSALIE ) . I think it 's a shame to bother her . And I think she 's quite right to go . Her sort of tricks are n't for people of intelligence .</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . Oh , wo n't you please stay ? ( To ROSALIE now C .)</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . I must not .</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . Wo n't you as a great favour to me ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Well , miss , since you ask it , I will stay .</stage>
   <stage>( MISS EASTWOOD laughs . She and TRENT go up L. CROSBY is by chesterfield C. MASON below table R. MRS. CROSBY is seated at lower end of table . MRS. TRENT comes to arm-chair L. C . and sits . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY . I 'm very glad . Really I 'm greatly interested .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( crosses R .) . Thank you , madame .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( coming down C .) . I think after what we 've seen , we must ask Madame la Grange to submit to certain conditions .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Anything at all , sir — anything at all .</stage>
   <stage>MASON ( down R .) . I agree with you . Frankly this woman impresses me . I think this test should be taken seriously .</stage>
   <stage>( MISS EASTWOOD at the L. end of the chesterfield , laughs . )</stage>
   <stage>WALES ( L. C . ) . Just what I was going to say .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( R. C . ) . If you will submit to the conditions we impose , Madame la Grange , and then show us any manifestations , I will never scoff at anything again .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Scoffing is the easiest thing anybody can do .</stage>
   <stage>( CROSBY crosses down R. below table . )</stage>
   <stage>If I could stop that even in one person , it would be a good thing . What is it that you do want ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . I want the window fastened .</stage>
   <stage>MASON . That 's the idea .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( coming in front of table R .) . Then we will have the doors locked . Will that be all right ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Oh , certainly all right .</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD ( coming down L. C . ) . At the risk of seeming unnecessarily sceptical , I 'm going to suggest that we search Madame la Grange — that is , of course , if she 's willing .</stage>
   <stage>( MISS ERSKINE and MISS STANDISH are at back of table R .)</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( C .) . But why not ? There are no ‘ oles in my stockings .</stage>
   <stage>( All laugh . )</stage>
   <stage>MASON ( down R .) . I suppose it 's going to be difficult for you to get results if we are all so antagonistic , Madame la Grange ?</stage>
   <stage>( MISS EASTWOOD goes up L. C . )</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . It is , sir , and it is not . If there is any who wants to communicate with any ‘ ere , maybe they can reach us . I do not know . I do not understand you . I showed you all the tricks ; would I have done that , if I wanted to — to — fool you ? Certainly I would not . Then why will you not believe that I am ‘ onest ?</stage>
   <stage>WALES ( down L .) . I 'm sure Madame la Grange is perfectly honest . We 've made certain stipulations to which she has agreed . I think we 've discussed matters enough already . We 're ready if you are , Madame la Grange .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . I am ready .</stage>
   <stage>( CROSBY looks at window fastenings R .)</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY ( seated at table over R .) . Do you know , I do n't believe it will be necessary to subject Madame la Grange to being searched . I 'm quite sure we can spare her that indignity .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . I do not mind if you fine ladies will not be shocked at seeing my plain lingerie .</stage>
   <stage>( WALES moves up L. General laugh . Miss ERSKINE joins WILLIAM and HELEN R. C . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY ( moving to L. of ROSALIE C .) . Come with me then , please . I 'm sure we wo n't be shocked . ( Aside to ROSALIE . ) I wear that kind myself .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Truly , madame ?</stage>
   <stage>( They go to door L .)</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY ( at door L .) , We sha n't be long .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( at door L .) . Madame , would you mind if all the ladies come ? Then they will all be sure I am concealing nothing .</stage>
   <stage>( The ladies all talk together and go out L. WALES closes the door down L. CROSBY comes from lack of table R. to chesterfield . )</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM ( by table R .) . Do you really want that window fastened ?</stage>
   <stage>( STANDISH is behind the chair below the table R .)</stage>
   <stage>WALES ( L. C . CROSBY and TRENT sit on corner of chesterfield ) . I do n't care .</stage>
   <stage>MASON ( at table R .) . I 'd like to make the test that way . I 've a queer feeling about that woman . I believe she really has power of some sort . I know it seems funny , but — well , you all saw her lift that table . I watched her carefully . There was no trick about it at all . I 'm sure of it .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . All right then . You fasten the window . Billy , you and Brad go and get some chairs out of the dining-room . We 'll need a lot .</stage>
   <stage>( WALES walks up and down L. of stage . WILLIAM and TRENT go out door R. C . )</stage>
   <stage>You put them in a circle , do n't you ? ( Begins to place chairs in a circle C. The chair L. of the fireplace is brought down and placed in front of the chesterfield . ) What are you going to do , Wales ? Ask her a lot of questions ?</stage>
   <stage>WALES ( L .) . I 'm going to try to find out who killed Spencer Lee .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Still harping on the murder of Spencer Lee ?</stage>
   <stage>( STANDISH places the chairs above and below the table in the circle , then the chair on the R. side of the fireplace in the circle . )</stage>
   <stage>WALES . Yes .</stage>
   <stage>MASON ( over R .— opening window curtains and raising window blind ) . Who was Spencer Lee ?</stage>
   <stage>WALES . The best friend I ever had .</stage>
   <stage>( TRENT and WILLIAM enter door R. C ., each carrying two chairs . They bring them down R. C . and exit R. C . )</stage>
   <stage>STANDISH ( placing chairs C. with backs to audience ) . We all knew Lee pretty well . And I know he was no good .</stage>
   <stage>WALES ( moving to L. C ., outside the circle ) . You must n't talk like that about him , Standish !</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( inside the circle and coming down C .) . The man 's dead : why not let him rest in peace ?</stage>
   <stage>( STANDISH outside of circle L. C . seat . )</stage>
   <stage>STANDISH . I did n't bring up the matter , you know , and I do n't want to hurt Ned 's feelings , but I know that the police found a lot of compromising letters and rotten things of that sort .</stage>
   <stage>( WILLIAM and TRENT re-enter from R. C ., each carrying two chairs . WILLIAM crosses and places two chairs R. side of circle then goes back to close the door . )</stage>
   <stage>WALES ( L. C . ) . I do n't care what they found , or what anyone thinks of Lee : he was my best friend , and if I can find out who killed him I 'm going to do it . It was a damned brutal murder , stabbed in the back , poor chap , with never a chance to fight for his life . ( Moves over L .)</stage>
   <stage>MASON ( by table R .) . I do n't seem to remember anything about the case .</stage>
   <stage>WALES . It happened before you got back from France — no , by Jove , it did n't either . It was a day or two after . I remember you and I had lunch together the day you got home and I had dinner that night with Spencer . Funny you do n't remember anything about it .</stage>
   <stage>( WILLIAM sits R. in circle . )</stage>
   <stage>MASON . Well , of course , I must have seen it in the papers , but I do n't go in much for crimes , and not knowing the man I was n't interested .</stage>
   <stage>STANDISH ( sitting in circle L. C . ) . It was a good deal of a sensation . The man knew a lot of nice people . Came here a good deal , did n't he , Mr. Crosby ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( sitting in circle up C .) . At one time . But after Helen married he rather dropped out of it . Fact is , until Trent here appeared on the scene he was always hanging around .</stage>
   <stage>( TRENT comes down and sits in R. side of circle . )</stage>
   <stage>STANDISH . Funny they never found out who killed him .</stage>
   <stage>WALES ( standing outside of circle , L. side ) . They may not . They have n't stopped trying .</stage>
   <stage>MASON ( seated on table R .) . Oh , are the police still interested ?</stage>
   <stage>WALES . Yes , they 're interested . As a matter of fact there 's a reward of five thousand dollars for the discovery of the murderers .</stage>
   <stage>STANDISH . Are you sure of that ?</stage>
   <stage>WALES . I offered it .</stage>
   <stage>TRENT . You ?</stage>
   <stage>WALES . Yes . What sort of a man do you think I am ? Do you expect me to sit still and let the murderers of Spencer Lee go free ? Why , I 'd known the man all his life . We were the closest friends .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . But if he was the kind of a man that Standish says —</stage>
   <stage>WALES . I do n't give a damn what he was . He was my friend , and I 'm never going to rest till I find out who killed him .</stage>
   <stage>TRENT . But .</stage>
   <stage>WALES . I would n't care so much if they 'd given the poor devil half a chance for his life , but they stabbed him in the back .</stage>
   <stage>MASON . Was n't there any indication —</stage>
   <stage>WALES . There was n't a thing to show who did it , or how it was done . A knife-wound between the shoulder-blades and no knife ever found . Nothing stolen , nothing disturbed . The police have found out that a young woman called to see him that afternoon , two or three hours before his body was discovered . That 's all that we know .</stage>
   <stage>TRENT ( with a laugh — still seated in circle ) . And now you 're going to try spiritualism ?</stage>
   <stage>WALES . Why not ? ( There is a pause . ) Do any of you object ?</stage>
   <stage>TRENT . Certainly not . I 'm rather for it .</stage>
   <stage>MASON ( rises , still on L. of table R .) . You are doing this seriously ? This is not a joke ?</stage>
   <stage>WALES . Quite seriously . ( There is a pause . ) Well , why wo n't somebody laugh ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . My dear fellow , why should anyone laugh ? This queer old woman may have powers of which we know nothing at all . Personally , I have n't much belief in that sort of thing , but I 'm not going to laugh at it . ( Rise . ) Neither am I going to have any trickery , or if there is any I 'm going to expose it .</stage>
   <stage>WALES ( over L .) . That 's perfectly fair .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . You 've been at her séances , or whatever they call them , before ?</stage>
   <stage>WALES . Yes .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . In the dark ?</stage>
   <stage>WALES . Invariably .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . I may want light . ( He turns to his son . ) Billy , if I call for lights you give them to me . Do n't wait for anything . Understand ?</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Perfectly , dad .</stage>
   <stage>( WILLIAM goes up to small table R. of chesterfield . Brings table with lamp on it down to his chair and the chair next to it in the circle . )</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( still in circle . ) That 's all right then .</stage>
   <stage>( The door L. opens . MRS. CROSBY enters , followed by MADAME LA GRANGE and the other ladies . WALES moves to R. C . outside circle , STANDISH to upper end of table R ., TRENT to L. side of circle . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY . I think it was n't fair of us .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Oh , madame , I did not mind .</stage>
   <stage>( MRS. CROSBY crosses back of chesterfield to up R. C . )</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD ( down L .) . I can assure you there is n't anything up her sleeve .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Well , what did you expect ? Burglar 's tools ?</stage>
   <stage>( MISS EASTWOOD goes up to L. end of chesterfield . MRS. TRENT closes door down L. She and HELEN move up L. with Miss STANDISH . )</stage>
   <stage>WALES ( over R .) . Madame la Grange , we 've fastened the windows .</stage>
   <stage>( TRENT , STANDISH , ERSKINE by console table L. of chesterfield . )</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . That is right . You cannot be too careful , eh ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . And now , if you do n't mind , I 'm going to lock the doors and keep the keys in my pocket .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Anything you do wish , sir . It is all the same to me .</stage>
   <stage>( Goes inside circle and sits down up C. in circle . )</stage>
   <stage>MASON ( R. C . ) . May I see that it 's done , Mr. Crosby ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( L. C ., with a laugh ) . Ca n't you trust me ?</stage>
   <stage>MASON . It is n't that — I — well , I just want to be sure . To see for myself .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Lock that one yourself , then . ( Indicating door R. C . MASON goes to and locks the door . CROSBY goes to door L. C ., locks it , takes out the key and puts it in his pocket . ) Better try it , Mason . ( MASON crosses to door L. C .— shows it is locked . ) Now well do this one . ( He starts to door down L. Then stops suddenly . ) No , I 've got a better way than this . My dear , will you ring for Pollock ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY ( upper end of table R .) . What are you going to do now ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Wait and see . ( To ROSALIE . ) You do n't object to this ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Oh , no , sir .</stage>
   <stage>( BUTLER enters from door L .— comes well on stage . )</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Oh , Pollock , I want you to put these keys in your pocket . ( Hands them to him . POLLOCK puts them in his waistcoat pocket . )</stage>
   <stage>POLLOCK . Yes , sir .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( L. C . ) . Now then , I want you to take the key out of that door , and lock it on the outside , understand ?</stage>
   <stage>POLLOCK . Perfectly , sir .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Then take the key from the lock and put that one in your pocket also , after that you are to stand outside that door , and you are not to unlock it until I tell you to . Understand ?</stage>
   <stage>POLLOCK . Yes , sir , I 'm to lock this door on the outside , keep the key in my pocket , and then stay just outside , and not open it for anyone until you tell me .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Exactly . ( General buzz of conversation . POLLOCK goes to the door L ., takes out the key and exits , closing the door after him . The key is heard turning in the lock . ) Now then , Mason , you 'd better try that door , too . ( MASON goes over and tries the door L. CROSBY follows him . Speaking through the door L .) Are you there , Pollock ?</stage>
   <stage>POLLOCK ( outside . ) Yes , sir .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . And the keys are in your pocket ?</stage>
   <stage>POLLOCK . Quite so , sir .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Now we 're ready , Madame la Grange .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Then please you will all sit in a circle and hold hands .</stage>
   <stage>MISS ERSKINE . Hold hands ! I 'm going to love this .</stage>
   <stage>( All laugh . )</stage>
   <stage>MASON ( moving down to a chair on the L. of the circle ) . How shall we sit ? I mean , do you want us in any particular order ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Any way at all .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . I 'll sit here . ( Takes chair and sits in reach of lamp on table R. C . )</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Any way will do .</stage>
   <stage>( HELEN and MRS. TRENT come down L .)</stage>
   <stage>( They all sit in a circle in the following order : ROSALIE , C .; CROSBY L. of ROSALIE ; MISS ERSKINE , MISS STANDISH , TRENT , MISS EASTWOOD ; MASON ; HELEN ; MRS. TRENT ; STANDISH and MRS. CROSBY ; WILLIAM sits on ROSALIE 'S right side . This will bring WALES sitting at C. with his back to the audience . ROSALIE directly opposite up stage facing him . The thirteen chairs in the circle consist of two brought from the fireplace , two from the table R ., eight from the room R. C ., and the armchair L. C ., which is moved C. and used by ROSALIE . As they are being seated there is a general buzz of conversation as follows :—)</stage>
   <stage>MISS ERSKINE . I 'm to sit next to you , Mr. Crosby .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . I 've always wanted to hold your hand , my dear .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY . Do n't trust him , Daisy .</stage>
   <stage>MISS ERSKINE . I wo n't , Mrs. Crosby .</stage>
   <stage>MISS STANDISH . I 'll chaperone them .</stage>
   <stage>MASON ( to HELEN ) . Will you sit by me ?</stage>
   <stage>TRENT . I 'll take this place then .</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD . I 'm really getting quite a thrill . ( ROSALIE laughs . ) What 's the joke , Madame la Grange ?</stage>
   <stage>( MRS. TRENT moves outside of circle to R. C ., then sits . )</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . I did not know anything could give to you a thrill .</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD . You do n't like me , do you , Madame la Grange ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Oh , mademoiselle , I am indeed very fond of you .</stage>
   <stage>WALES ( standing below circle R. C . ) . I think we 're all ready .</stage>
   <stage>( The others are all seated and WALES is about to sit down . )</stage>
   <stage>MISS ERSKINE ( counting hurriedly ) . Oh ! There are thirteen of us . Do n't sit there , Mr. Wales .</stage>
   <stage>WALES . Oh , I do n't mind those little superstitions . ( Sits down stage side of circle between HELEN and MRS . TRENT . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY . What do we do now ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Now , will you please all join your ‘ ands , and then sit very , very quiet . Do not try to think of anything .</stage>
   <stage>TRENT . By Jove , that 'll be easy for me .</stage>
   <stage>( The others laugh . )</stage>
   <stage>WALES . We can n't get any results if you treat this as a joke .</stage>
   <stage>( All laugh . )</stage>
   <stage>STANDISH . Oh , let 's be serious .</stage>
   <stage>MISS ERSKINE . Why , Howard ?</stage>
   <stage>STANDISH . Well , there might be something in it . Anyhow , it 's only fair to do what Madame la Grange wants . I suppose you 'd like the lights out ? I 've always understood that was necessary .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . We shall ‘ ave better results in that way .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Right ! ( He rises , goes to door L ., and switches off light . This leaves only the two table lamps R. and L. of the chesterfield C. still lit . All other lights on scene out . Crosses back to his chair — turns out table lamp L. of chesterfield . ) Billy , you turn out that light as soon as we are ready .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Right you are , dad .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . That is all , then . Now you are not to be afraid if I cry or moan when I do go into a trance . I am not in pain or anything like that . I do not even know that I do such things , but I ‘ ave been told that it sometime ‘ appen . My spirit control is a sweet little child named Laughing Eyes . When she begins to talk you can ask ‘ er anything you do want . If she do not answer you she do not want to talk to you . Then whoever it is speaking must let someone else try . That is all , ladies and gentlemen . ( She settles back in her chair . ) Now then , sir , please to put out that light .</stage>
   <stage>( WILLIAM turns off the light , and the stage is in darkness all but spots on ceiling . )</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . That wo n't do . Billy , pull down the blind , that light on the ceiling is too strong .</stage>
   <stage>( WILLIAM turns on light , crosses R ., pulls blind down and closes curtains , then resumes his seat and puts light out . ROSALIE rises , crosses back of circle to the back of MISS EASTWOOD 'S chair . There is a pause . Suddenly MISS EASTWOOD screams shrilly . )</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD . There 's a hand on my face . There 's a hand on my face !</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Will , the light !</stage>
   <stage>( The light on the table goes up , showing WILLIAM leaning back in his chair with one hand on the switch , the other is tightly clasped in his father 's hand . ROSALIE is seen standing behind MISS EASTWOOD , with her hand resting on MISS EASTWOOD 'S cheek . )</stage>
   <stage>( They all start to speak . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. TRENT . It 's a trick .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Yes , it is a trick . ( They stop and stare at her . Her manner is commanding , and a little stern . ) I was going to ask you to tie my ‘ ands to the arm of the chair , but I thought I would show you this first .</stage>
   <stage>MASON . I do n't see how you did it — even now .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( standing outside of circle L .) . Things ‘ appen in the dark . The sense of touch is not much developed except in those who are blind . When this young gentleman did let go my ‘ and to turn out the light , I did take my other ‘ and away from Mr. Crosby and when we joined ‘ ands again the two gentlemen were ‘ olding ‘ ands as comfortable as you please . And I was free . It is an old trick . All the mediums do use it . Anyone can do it . ( She moves back to her chair and sits . ) Now , if someone will tie me in , we will go on .</stage>
   <stage>MASON . How do we know that you can n't get free even then ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Tie me so that I cannot .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( rising ) . I 'll see to that . I want something strong .</stage>
   <stage>MASON . Take handkerchiefs , they are strong enough . ( Takes handkerchief . )</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . They 'll do very well . ( Takes out his own . ) I want three more .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Here 's mine . ( Hands his handkerchief to his father . MASON and TRENT give CROSBY theirs . )</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Now , Madame la Grange , if you do n't mind . ( He ties her hands to the arm of the chair . ) I do n't see why you did that just now .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . I told you I wanted to be sure .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Why ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Because I think something is going to ‘ appen . I think there will be manifestations . I wanted you to know I was not faking .</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD . Why should we think that you were ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Why , you ‘ ave thought nothing else ever since I did come into the room .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Mason , see if she can get free from that now .</stage>
   <stage>( MASON comes over , inspects the knot . CROSBY tying the other hand . )</stage>
   <stage>MASON . That seems pretty secure — someone else look at it .</stage>
   <stage>( WILLIAM and TRENT rise and go to ROSALIE 'S chair . )</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . I 'm going to fasten your ankles now , Madame la Grange .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Yes , that is right .</stage>
   <stage>( CROSBY ties ROSALIE 'S ankles to leg of chair . The other two men look on . )</stage>
   <stage>WALES . I do n't believe all this is necessary .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Why not , if they do want it .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Now I 'm sure she can n't get away .</stage>
   <stage>( MASON inspects knot . )</stage>
   <stage>MASON . So am I .</stage>
   <stage>( The men resume their places . )</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Well , now , if you will all sit down , please — ( Pause . ) You will have to reach over and take my hands this time — are you all satisfied now ? Is there anything more you want me to do ? ( There is no answer . ) Then if you will all sit quiet , just keep your minds perfectly free , that is all you ‘ ave to do . Now , sir , please to turn out the light .</stage>
   <stage>( WILLIAM turns out the light . )</stage>
   <stage>( There is a long pause . ROSALIE moans and whispers as if in pain . )</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . I can n't stand this , I —</stage>
   <stage>WALES . Please keep still — she asked us to keep still .</stage>
   <stage>( ROSALIE moans again ; after a short pause , she gives a choking sob ; another pause . Finally she speaks with frequent pauses , using the voice of a little child . )</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Laughing Eyes is sad , very sad . I a ma long way off — a long way . ( Pause . ) Bad people , bad people , un'appy — he is un'appy — ( Pause . ) ( Knife is set down in sight of audience , sticking in the ceiling . ) Spencer wants to tell Ned — ( She moans heavily . ) It hurts — terrible — like a knife — it burns — burns , in the back —</stage>
   <stage>( A man 's voice from the chesterfield , facing fireplace , speaks :)</stage>
   <stage>VOICE . Ned , I want Ned — why in Hell does n't Ned answer ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( in child 's voice ) . He wants to talk to Ned — is Ned here ?</stage>
   <stage>STANDISH . Ned who ? Who is it ? Who does he want to speak to ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( in child 's voice ) . Tell Ned it is Spencer — Spencer wants to tell Ned about the letters and the pain in the back — in the back .</stage>
   <stage>STANDISH . What was in the back ? ( There is no answer . ) Ask him what was in the back ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( still using child 's voice ) . The knife — Ned — he wants Ned .</stage>
   <stage>WALES . What do you want !</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . A swimming pool — do not forget the swimming pool . Do not ever forget —</stage>
   <stage>WALES . You mean the time he went in after me when I was drowning ? When we were little boys ? Is that what he wants me to remember ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Spencer says he cannot rest — he wants to tell you it is hard to reach — too far away — you promised —</stage>
   <stage>WALES . Promised what ? When did I promise !</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Your life saved —</stage>
   <stage>WALES . Now I know — I told him I 'd do anything in the world for him . Spencer , of course , I remember — what do you want me to do ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Find — find —</stage>
   <stage>WALES . Do you want me to find the letters ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . In the back — someone came — someone came .</stage>
   <stage>WALES . You 're trying to tell who killed you ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Ask — ask — ask .</stage>
   <stage>WALES . You want me to ask questions ? Is that it ? You mean you can n't talk much ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Too far away .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . You know who killed you ?</stage>
   <stage>( There is a pause , but no answer . )</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . He says Ned , he wants Ned .</stage>
   <stage>WALES . You want me to ask .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . He wants Ned to ask .</stage>
   <stage>WALES . Do you know who killed you ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. TRENT ( hysterically ) . Oh , my God !</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Keep still , Helen .</stage>
   <stage>WALES . Can you tell the name ? ( ROSALIE suddenly gives a long moan . ) Quick , the name , the name . Spencer , tell me who killed you — she 's coming out of her trance . I want the name . ( ROSALIE moans again . Her cry is overtopped by a shriek from WALES . ) Oh , my God ! My back — oh ! ( Then there is a dead silence that lasts as long as it will hold . )</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Wales , is anything the matter ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. TRENT . Father , he 's pulling at my hand .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . The light , Will .</stage>
   <stage>( WILLIAM suddenly turns on the light at table . WALES is discovered leaning forward , the circle is unbroken . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. TRENT . Look at him ! Father ! Look at him !</stage>
   <stage>( CROSBY drops ROSALIE 'S hand and springs forward towards WALES . At the same instant WALES falls forward on his face to the floor . The others all rise , chairs are knocked over in the confusion which follows . )</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Stand back , please . ( The others move back a little . CROSBY leans over WALES . ) Why , he — why — it 's impossible .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY . Roscoe , look at your hand .</stage>
   <stage>( CROSBY looks at his hand , takes out his handkerchief and wipes it hurriedly , then crosses suddenly to the door L. ROSALIE has come out of her trance and sits staring at WALES as he lies on the floor in front of her . The two figures are thrown out from the shadows of the room by the light on the table at the back of MADAME LA GRANGE . The rest of the room is in semi-darkness . TRENT kneels by WALES ’ body . )</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Pollock ! Pollock !</stage>
   <stage>POLLOCK ( outside ) . Yes , sir .</stage>
   <stage>( TRENT turns WALES ’ body over on back . )</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Get on the ‘ phone at once and call up Police Headquarters . Get Inspector Donohue if you can . Tell him to come to the house at once .</stage>
   <stage>POLLOCK . Very good , sir .</stage>
   <stage>( CROSBY turns away from the door , and faces the others who have followed him over . )</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Father , what do you suppose it is ? Are you sure that —</stage>
   <stage>MRS. TRENT . It can n't be . He was talking and —</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY . Roscoe , are you sure ? Had n't we better send for a doctor ?</stage>
   <stage>( TRENT is leaning over WALES ’ body on the floor . )</stage>
   <stage>TRENT . It 's no use . He 's dead .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Murdered !</stage>
   <stage>TRENT ( rises ) . What ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Mr. Wales was stabbed in the back , just as Spencer Lee was stabbed in the back .</stage>
   <stage>STANDISH . Just as he was asking — just when he was trying to find out who —</stage>
   <stage>( There is a knock on the door down L .)</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . What is it ?</stage>
   <stage>POLLOCK ( outside of door ) . Inspector Donohue was at the Fifty-first Street Station , sir . He 's on his way here . ( There is a pause ) . Shall I unlock the door , sir ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . No — not until the Inspector tells you .</stage>
   <p>CURTAIN .</p>
   <p>ACT II</p>
   <stage>Ten minutes later .</stage>
   <stage>Discovered :— CROSBY standing by the door L. ROSALIE still tied in chair . Dummy supposed to represent WALES ’ body , covered by a piece of drapery , has been placed on chesterfield facing fireplace up C .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. TRENT seated below console table L. end of chesterfield .</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD seated at R. end of console table R. of chesterfield , rattling book leaves .</stage>
   <stage>STANDISH standing over R. below table .</stage>
   <stage>MISS STANDISH is sitting L. C .</stage>
   <stage>HELEN — WILLIAM — standing above table R .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY seated L. next to ROSALIE . MISS ERSKINE seated next to MRS. CROSBY , tapping the sides of the chair with her fingers . MASON in front of fireplace C ., looking at WALES ’ body . Eventually he moves to MISS EASTWOOD and takes the book away from her .</stage>
   <stage>TRENT walking up stage L. as curtain rises . All lamps alight .</stage>
   <stage>The arrangement of the chairs for this act is detailed at the end of the play .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. TRENT ( rising and moving to CROSBY ) . Father , please let me go to my room .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . It is impossible , my dear .</stage>
   <stage>TRENT . But , Mr. Crosby — ( Comes down to CROSBY L .)</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( interrupting him ) . It 's quite impossible .</stage>
   <stage>( MRS. TRENT goes to and sits in chair up L ., followed by TRENT , who stands R. side of her . WILLIAM sits back of table R. HELEN sits above table R .)</stage>
   <stage>STANDISH ( below table over R .) . Mr. Crosby , I must —</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Mr. Standish , I just refused to let my own daughter leave the room .</stage>
   <stage>( Slight pause . )</stage>
   <stage>STANDISH . But do n't you see , sir —</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . My dear Standish , poor Wales was killed by someone in this room . We are all of us under suspicion . Everyone of us . ( Slight movement from all . ) It 's an awful thing to say — but one of us in this room has killed Wales . Which one of us ?</stage>
   <stage>( Knock on door down L .)</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Yes .</stage>
   <stage>POLLOCK ( outside ) . The police are here , sir .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Who is it ?</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( outside ) . Inspector Donohue .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Pollock , give Inspector Donohue all the keys .</stage>
   <stage>POLLOCK ( outside ) . Yes , sir .</stage>
   <stage>( There is a pause . )</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( outside ) . What is all this ?</stage>
   <stage>POLLOCK ( outside ) . I do n't know , I 'm sure . I was told to lock the door . I do n't know what 's been going on inside . Then I was told to call you . This is the right key for that door .</stage>
   <stage>( The noise of the key being put into the lock can be heard , then the click as it is turned in the lock , then the door is opened , and INSPECTOR DONOHUE in plain clothes comes well on stage L. He is seen to be a clean-cut , intelligent-looking man of fifty . It later develops that he is reserved and extremely quiet in manner . He speaks like a gentleman and acts like one . SERGEANT DUNN enters also and drops below door L .)</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Where 's Mr. Wales ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( L. C . ) . How did you know that Wales —</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( L. of CROSBY , interrupting him ) . I do n't know anything . I was thinking of something else . I was told that I was wanted here in a hurry .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Queer your asking for Wales . Mr. Wales is dead ; that 's why I sent for you .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Wales is what ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Wales is dead .</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD ( still seated R. C . ) . Yes , and if you ask me —</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Just a minute , please , miss . ( He turns to CROSBY . ) It must have been very sudden . Why , only this afternoon I — Did he ask you to send for me ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( L. C . ) . Inspector , you do n't seem to understand . Mr. Wales was murdered in this room not fifteen minutes ago .</stage>
   <stage>( Other characters keep the same positions as when the curtain rose . )</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( his manner changing abruptly ) . Mike ! That door ! ( SERGEANT DUNN closes door L. and stands in front of it . ) Where have you taken him ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( pointing to the chesterfield C .) . There .</stage>
   <stage>( DONOHUE goes up L. end of chesterfield to C. and stands looking down on the body . There is a long pause , and then slowly raising his head looks with terrible deliberation at each person in the room . MASON moves to R. end of chesterfield . )</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Who did this ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . We do n't know .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( very quietly ) . Then I expect we 'll have to find out . ( He comes down by the R. end of the chesterfield and stops when he sees ROSALIE . He gives a short laugh as he sees how she is tied to the chair . ) What 's this ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY ( rises ) . Good Heavens , we forgot to untie her ! I 'm so sorry .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Thank you , madame . I am quite comfortable . I will stay as I am if you do not mind .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY . But —</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . I think we 'll leave things as they are for the present .</stage>
   <stage>( MRS. CROSBY resumes the same seat as before . )</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . A policeman with brains ! Oh , la-la !</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Let 's see if he can n't use them then . ( Moving to CROSBY down L. C . and standing on his R . side . ) Now , Mr. Crosby , tell me exactly what happened .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . I know it sounds foolish , but we were having a spiritualistic seance . Madame la Grange is a medium .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . I see .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . We were sitting in the dark , in a circle , you know , holding hands . Suddenly Wales cried out . I called to my son to turn on the light . He did so . Wales was leaning forward in his chair . His hands were in those of the people he sat between , and all the rest of us were sitting around .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . All of you ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Yes .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . I thought you told your son to turn on the lights .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . If you 're implying that —</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . I 'm not implying anything , and please answer my questions .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM ( rises , and stands back of table R .) . Inspector , I was sitting there , and simply made a move to turn on the light . I had chosen the seat purposely . We wanted to expose trickery , if we found any .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . I understand . ( He turns again to CROSBY . ) Go on , Mr. Crosby .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . In a moment poor Wales fell to the floor . I ran to him and found that he had been stabbed in the back . Before we could call for aid , he was dead .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Did he say anything ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . No . I think that he was dead before we got to him .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . What happened then ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . As soon as I realized what had happened I sent for you .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Why for me ? Why not simply notify the police ? I mean , was there any special reason for wanting me ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . There was , but I was n't conscious of it at the time . We 'd been talking about the killing of Spencer Lee earlier in the evening , and I suppose that subconsciously I remembered that you were handling that case , which brought yours as the first name to my mind . That 's all .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . I see . ( Going C. a few steps . ) Now then , who 's been in or out of this room since ? Of course , you know you had no right to move Mr. Wales .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( L. C . ) . Yes , I know , but I could n't let him lie there on the floor . It was a little too much . You see we were all locked in here and and —</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Locked in ! You mean as I found you when I came ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Exactly . We had all of the windows fastened and all doors locked for the séance . Pollock had the keys , I refused to let him open the door until you came .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Mr. Crosby , you are forgiven for breaking the Coroner 's rules . As I understand , then , you were sitting in this room with the doors and windows locked ; you were in the dark . Wales was stabbed in the back , the lights were turned on , and no one has left the room or entered since ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . No one but you .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . I did n't kill him . ( There is a long pause , then he turns with a sweeping gesture . ) Which one of you did ? ( Slight movement from others . There is another long pause . No one speaks . He moves very quietly down R. C . to below table R .) Now , I 'm not going to employ the usual police methods . There is to be no threatening or badgering . But you all can see that there can be no escape for the guilty person . I realize that this is a terrible situation for all of you , but the only way to relieve it is for the murderer of Mr. Wales to confess . ( Another pause . ) It will save a long , and I assure you , a very trying police investigation . Let me say also that there will be no recriminations , no unpleasant scenes . I realize that this seems a very weak plea for a confession . But I am counting on the intelligence of the people now in this room . ( He takes out his watch and holds it face upward in his hand . ) I have unlimited time , but not a great deal of patience . Well ? ( There is another long pause . He finally replaces his watch with a little gesture of finality . ) Very well then . ( He turns suddenly to MISS EASTWOOD , who is still seated up R. C . ) What is your name ?</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD . Mary Eastwood .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . A moment ago , Miss Eastwood , you started to tell me something . You said , “ If you ask me — ” Now I am asking you . What was it you wanted to tell me ?</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD ( seated R. of console table R .) . I do n't want to especially . But I think I ought to tell you this . No one else seems to have thought of it . When the séance started we were all sitting in a circle holding each others ’ hands . As I understand it —</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . We can take it for granted that I know how that is done . Go on , please .</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD . The medium got out of the circle without our knowing it , and then showed us how she did the trick .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . I see .</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD . Why could n't she have done it again ? Of course , that 's what someone did , is n't it ? And if she could get out of the circle without our knowing it , she could get back in again , could n't she ?</stage>
   <stage>( HELEN rises . MISS EASTWOOD continues with an air of triumph . )</stage>
   <stage>That 's what I wanted to tell you .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . If any one of you , or all of you , can get me out of this chair without untying me or cutting me loose , I will say that I ‘ ave done that murder .</stage>
   <stage>( HELEN sits above table R .)</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Thank you , Miss Eastwood . It 's only fair to tell you that there is n't a trick or an effect that these people do that the police do not understand perfectly .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Is that so ?</stage>
   <stage>( DONOHUE goes over and examines the way in which ROSALIE is tied to the chair . )</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Why was she tied up ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( down L. C . ) . At her own request . As Miss Eastwood says , she showed us how she broke out of the circle and then suggested that we tie her into that chair to make sure she did n't do it again .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( R. of ROSALIE 'S chair ) . It 's lucky for her that she did . Even if she had slipped out of those knots , there 's no way in the world that she could get back in .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . I did say this policeman ‘ ad brains . ( DONOHUE turns away from her . ) Get me loose , dear Inspector . My foot ‘ e sleeps .</stage>
   <stage>( DONOHUE turns back and unties handkerchiefs with which she is tied . She gets up and stands in front of arm-chair C .)</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Thank you very much , Miss Eastwood , that eliminates one .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Then I can go ? ( Starting for door L .)</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . You cannot .</stage>
   <stage>( ROSALIE goes R. of arm-chair and sits R. end of chesterfield C .)</stage>
   <stage>Anyone else anything they want to tell me ? ( Pause . ) No ? Mike , you 'd better ‘ phone the Coroner and ask him to come up here . Tell him I do not want the case reported yet . And suggest that he hurries .</stage>
   <stage>DUNN . Yes , Inspector .</stage>
   <stage>( He turns and exits L ., leaving the door open behind him . STANDISH and TRENT start towards door L .)</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( turning to them ) . That open door does not mean freedom for any of you yet .</stage>
   <stage>TRENT ( coming to DONOHUE C .) . I 'm awfully sorry , Inspector , but I 've an important business engagement at ten o'clock . My father-in-law here will —</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . That 's quite impossible .</stage>
   <stage>( TRENT goes up L. again and stands L. side of MRS . TRENT . )</stage>
   <stage>STANDISH ( moving to L. C . ) . That is all very well , Inspector , but you know you can n't keep us in this room for ever . If you want to take the consequences of accusing me of murder , well , that 's your affair . But my patience is exhausted and I have n't the slightest intention of remaining here much longer . Unless , of course , you are planning to arrest me .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( C .) . I see . By the way , who are you ?</stage>
   <stage>STANDISH . Howard Standish , of Standish , Giles &amp; Updegraff , 120 Broadway . My brother is Judge Standish of the Supreme Court .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . And you refuse to remain here any longer ?</stage>
   <stage>STANDISH . I do .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Very well , Mr. Standish of Standish , Giles &amp; Updegraff . You are arrested as a material witness in this case . As soon as Sergeant Dunn returns he will call a patrol wagon and take you down to the House of Detention . ( Turns and crosses R .) Are there any others who insist on leaving this room ?</stage>
   <stage>STANDISH . I beg your pardon , Inspector . I acted like a fool .</stage>
   <stage>( MASON R. of chesterfield C .)</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Not at all , sir , your actions are entirely natural .</stage>
   <stage>( STANDISH goes up L. DUNN 'S voice is heard outside . )</stage>
   <stage>DUNN . Hello ! Hello ! No , sir . But Inspector Donohue wants you to come here at once . We 're at Mr. Roscoe Crosby 's house . No , sir ( DONOHUE crosses over and closes the door L .) , he does n't want the case reported yet .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . We need n't be bothered with that , anyway . ( Moves back to R. C . There is a pause . ) Well , I 'm afraid we 'll have to begin work . ( He goes over to table R. and sits down stage end of table . Takes paper and gets pencil . ) With the exception of Mr. Crosby , who is known to nearly everyone , and Mr. Standish , who has so pleasantly introduced himself to me , I know none of you . So I 'll have to ask — ( He stops suddenly and rises , facing them all . He points slowly to the chesterfield , facing fireplace up C .) That 's rather a gruesome thing there . I think we 'll move it into another room . Will some of you gentlemen carry Mr. Wales ’ body into the other room . ( There is a pause . The men all hesitate . Finally MASON starts to move to chesterfield . DONOHUE is down stage R. C . ) Thank you very much . We 'll —</stage>
   <stage>( Coming to C. DUNN enters from L .)</stage>
   <stage>DUNN . Dr. Bernstein himself is on the way here , Inspector .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Good ! Mike , get one of the servants to help you to carry this sofa into another room .</stage>
   <stage>( DUNN turns and exits L. without speaking . )</stage>
   <stage>I wo n't have to trouble you after all , sir .</stage>
   <stage>( MASON drops down to console table R. of chesterfield . DONOHUE gives a little laugh . )</stage>
   <stage>Funny how these old superstitions cling to us . One of the first tests for guilt invented by detectives was to ask a supposed murderer to touch the body of his victim . ( Slight pause . ) The test did n't work very well , did it ? Certainly you four gentlemen can n't all be guilty . ( Slight pause . ) Well , we 'll have to try something else . ( Very impressively . ) Because , you know , I really am going to arrest the murderer of Edward Wales to-night .</stage>
   <stage>( DUNN enters from L ., followed by POLLOCK . )</stage>
   <stage>Carry the sofa into another room , please .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( down L .) . Into that room , please . ( Indicating door L. C . )</stage>
   <stage>( DUNN goes up to door L. C ., turns knob — discovers door is locked . POLLOCK crosses to R. end of chesterfield facing fireplace on which dummy has been placed between first and second acts . Dummy is covered with a drapery . )</stage>
   <stage>DUNN ( at door L. C . ) . The door is locked .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( C .) . Oh , yes , try these keys .</stage>
   <stage>( DUNN comes down L. C ., gets keys , goes up and unlocks door . He and POLLOCK pick up chesterfield , POLLOCK taking his end of chesterfield through door L. C . first . )</stage>
   <stage>And , Mike !</stage>
   <stage>( DUNN turns his head . )</stage>
   <stage>DUNN . Yes , sir .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Make as quick an examination as you can and report to me here . ( The men exit carrying sofa into room L. C . DONOHUE crosses to chair below table R. and sits . TRENT places chair L. C . ) If you will all come a little closer , please .</stage>
   <stage>( The positions now become as follows :— WILLIAM back of table R .; HELEN O'NEILL seated above table ; MISS EASTWOOD seated below console table R. end of chesterfield ; ROSALIE seated C. chesterfield ; MRS. CROSBY seated in arm-chair up C .; MASON standing upper end of table R .; MISS ERSKINE seated up L. C . ; MRS. TRENT seated in chair L. C . ; STANDISH standing L. of MRS. TRENT , and TRENT seated L. C . ; CROSBY down L. C . DONOHUE seated lower end of table R .)</stage>
   <stage>Now , I can see you all quite comfortably .</stage>
   <stage>( POLLOCK enters door L. C ., closes door — crosses to door L. and exits , closing the door . )</stage>
   <stage>As I started to say a moment ago , I shall have to find out something about each of you . You , madam ? ( He turns to MRS . CROSBY . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY ( seated in arm-chair C .) . I 'm Alicia Crosby . Mrs. Roscoe Crosby .</stage>
   <stage>( He makes notes on paper in front of him . )</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . I 'm sorry to trouble you , Miss — ( He points his pencil at MISS ERSKINE , seated L. C . )</stage>
   <stage>MISS ERSKINE . Elizabeth Erskine . I 'm —</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . It 's not necessary to tell your age .</stage>
   <stage>MISS ERSKINE . I was n't going to . I 'm the daughter of Edward Erskine , my father is the banker .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . I know him . Thank you . You are then merely a guest here ?</stage>
   <stage>MISS ERSKINE . A friend .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Miss Eastwood , I already know . And you , miss ?</stage>
   <stage>MISS STANDISH . Grace Standish .</stage>
   <stage>STANDISH . My sister .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Oh ! And this young lady ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( puts his hand on MRS. TRENT 'S shoulder L. C . ) . My daughter , Mrs. Trent . She and Trent here live with us .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . And you , sir ?</stage>
   <stage>MASON ( there is a pause ) . Philip Mason . ( At upper end of table R .)</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . That does n't tell me very much .</stage>
   <stage>MASON ( with a laugh ) . There is n't very much to tell . I 'm just a friend of the family . We 've known , each other for years . I 've lived in Paris for the last two or three years . I 'm a painter .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . You mean an artist ?</stage>
   <stage>MASON . Well , I do n't paint houses or fences , but I 'd hardly call myself an artist — yet .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Poor , I suppose ? I know you 'll pardon that question , wo n't you ?</stage>
   <stage>MASON . Quite all right , I assure you . No , I 'm not poor .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Thank you . ( Turns toward WILLIAM , who is standing back of HELEN 'S chair above table R .) And you ?</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . I 'm young Crosby .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . I see . Live here , I suppose ?</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Certainly , where else should I live ?</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . I thought perhaps you might be married .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( L. C . ) . He 's not , but if he were he 'd live with us and —</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . No , father . When I marry I 've got to have my own home and —</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Nonsense . Do n't talk like a fool . You 'd live here with me and your mother — and your wife , of course .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . I think perhaps we 'd better defer that discussion , gentlemen . ( He turns toward HELEN . ) And this young lady ?</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . My fiancée , Miss O'Neill .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Well , that finishes that . ( Rises , standing below table R .)</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD . But , Inspector , you have n't asked anything about the medium ?</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Perhaps I do n't consider that necessary , Miss Eastwood .</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD . But —</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . And I 'm terribly set on conducting this investigation in my own way , if you do n't mind .</stage>
   <stage>( Enter DUNN from L. C . )</stage>
   <stage>DUNN . Inspector !</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Well ?</stage>
   <stage>DUNN ( at door L. C . ) . I can n't tell for sure , but I guess the knife went clean into the heart . He must have died instantly .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . All right . Let me know when the Coroner arrives . ( DUNN starts toward door down L .) And , Dunn !</stage>
   <stage>DUNN . Yes , sir .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( going C .) . You 'd better let me have a look at that knife .</stage>
   <stage>( DUNN turns sharply and looks at him . )</stage>
   <stage>DUNN ( down L .) . The knife ?</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Yes , the knife .</stage>
   <stage>DUNN . I have n't seen any knife . I thought you had it .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . No . I have n't seen it . ( There is a long pause . DONOHUE is R. of CROSBY . ) Mr. Crosby ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( still L. C . ) . We did n't find it .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Look carefully ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Everywhere . While we were waiting for you .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Who moved Mr. Wales ’ body ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . I did .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . No one else touched him ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . No one .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . What did you do , after you had carried him to the sofa ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . I saw that he had been stabbed . I looked for the knife .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Where ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . On the floor , under the stairs , everywhere I could think of .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . No trace of it ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . None .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . What did you do then ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Nothing . I waited for you .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . How long after you found that Mr. Wales was killed did you turn on the lights ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Why , I told you ; we turned on the light before we found what had happened .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Would it have been possible for the murderer to have hidden it about the room ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . I doubt it very much .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Why ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . I do n't think there would have been time . I do n't see how anyone could have done it at all . It 's all a mystery to me . I told you the circle was intact . You remember ?</stage>
   <stage>( There is a pause . )</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Yes , I remember . Then if the knife was hidden , it 's probably on the person of the man or woman who used it .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . I think so , undoubtedly .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Mike , ‘ phone over to the station house and have them send a matron over here .</stage>
   <stage>( DUNN exits L ., and closes the door after him . )</stage>
   <stage>Now about that light . There was just one lamp turned on as I remember .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Someone turned on the rest of the lights , almost immediately .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Could the knife have been hidden about the room , since that time ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . It 's extremely unlikely . We have all been here together . A thing of that sort would have been seen .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Then I expect we 'll find it without much trouble . ( There is a pause , as he looks slowly at each person individually in the room . WILLIAM puts arm on HELEN 'S shoulders as DONOHUE looks at him . ) In the meantime , I think we 'll let it remain where it is . ( Crosses down R. He turns with a gesture which takes them all in . ) You see how inevitably the guilty person must be discovered . Do n't you think it would be much simpler to confess ? ( Pause . ) No ? Then I suppose we will have to continue . ( Crosses up L ., takes a chair and places it L. side of circle , then he takes the chair down L. and places that in lower left-hand side of circle . CROSBY moves to C .) I 'd like to visualize the scene a little more clearly . ( TRENT places chair L. side of circle . ) Let 's form that circle again — ( Turns two single chairs down C. around with backs to audience . Crosses and gets chair in front of table and places it in lower right-hand side of circle . MRS. CROSBY , MISS ERSKINE , MRS. TRENT , TRENT and MISS STANDISH rise and move to the L. of the circle . ) Of course this time without Mr. Wales . ( MISS EASTWOOD rises and stands at R. end of chesterfield . During these last few speeches of DONOHUE , TRENT and CROSBY have placed the remainder of chairs in the circle . ) All sit as you were sitting at the séance .</stage>
   <stage>( There is a general movement . STANDISH crosses R. to above table R. The minute this suggestion is made ROSALIE comes down , nearer to DONOHUE , and looks at him anxiously . Something in his suggestion greatly disturbs her . )</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( in upper L. side of circle ) . Will , you were there by the lamp , and Madame la Grange was next to you , and I was next to her —</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Then how did they sit ? ( Down R .)</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( next to ROSALIE , L. C . ) . I 'm trying to remember . It 's queer what a jumbled memory one has . If anyone had asked me about it I would have said I could have told how we were sitting with great accuracy . But I can n't somehow .</stage>
   <stage>MISS ERSKINE . I was next to you , Mr. Crosby . ( Upper L. side of circle . She turns to MRS. CROSBY , who is standing over L .) Do n't you remember , Mrs. Crosby , he said he 'd always wanted to hold my hand , and we joked about it . ( Sits in her original chair . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY ( L ., outside of circle ) . Yes . I remember .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . That 's all right , then . Who came next ?</stage>
   <stage>( Down R. They all hesitate . )</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( eagerly ) . Inspector , I can place them all for you .</stage>
   <stage>MASON ( over end of table R .) . But you said you did n't care how we sat .</stage>
   <stage>( HELEN R. C . in circle . )</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . So I did , sir , but I knew where you were sitting all the same . You will permit that I show you , Inspector ?</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( after a pause ) . If you will be so kind .</stage>
   <stage>( MISS STANDISH sits in circle . )</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . The young lady was ‘ ere . And this gentleman ‘ e was ‘ ere . ( Indicating TRENT 'S chair . )</stage>
   <stage>TRENT ( from L ., outside of circle ) . By George , I could n't have told you , but she 's right . This is exactly where I was sitting . ( Sits in circle . )</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( taking HELEN hastily by the shoulder and putting her in the next seat ) . And this young lady was ‘ ere . ( HELEN looks at her for a moment and then sinks back in her chair . ROSALIE points at MASON . ) He did come next .</stage>
   <stage>MASON ( over R .) . No , you 're wrong there — I — You 're right — I remember perfectly I was next to Miss O'Neill . ( Crosses L. and sits L. side of circle . ) I know just how her hand felt in the dark .</stage>
   <stage>( WILLIAM looks at him quickly . HELEN turns and looks at him in wonder . )</stage>
   <stage>HELEN ( seated L. side in circle ) . Well really , Mr. Mason !</stage>
   <stage>MASON . Oh , I do n't mean it that way at all . I assure you I do n't .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Then why did you say it ? ( Seated R. C . )</stage>
   <stage>MASON . My dear fellow , I 've apologized . You are misunderstanding me .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY . I think we 're all very much upset . ( L. outside circle . ) Inspector Donohue , must we go through all this again ?</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . I 'm afraid so , Mrs. Crosby .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Then let 's get it over as quickly as possible . ( Sits C. in his original chair in circle . )</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Mr. Crosby , you seem to forget that this is a police investigation , and must be conducted as I see fit . Who sat next to Mr. Mason ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( pointing to MISS EASTWOOD ) . This young lady .</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD . I was next to Mr. Mason , was n't I , Philip ?</stage>
   <stage>( Crossing inside of circle , to chair lower L. side of circle , and sits . )</stage>
   <stage>MASON . Yes .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Now then , who occupied this seat ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. TRENT ( L. C . outside of circle ) . Mr. Wales . I know because I sat there , and I was next to him . Shall I sit there now ?</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . If you will be so good .</stage>
   <stage>( MRS. TRENT crosses to R. and sits in circle . )</stage>
   <stage>STANDISH ( upper end of table R .) . I was next to Mrs. Trent . ( He sits . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY . And I was here between Mr. Standish and Billy .</stage>
   <stage>( She sits . DONOHUE moves off a step down R. and stands looking at them as they sit . ROSALIE moves over and takes her place in armchair . )</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . You are all sure that 's where you were sitting ?</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD . There 's some mix up here , I know . ( ROSALIE rises . ) I was n't next to Mr. Wales .</stage>
   <stage>HELEN ( rises ) . Of course you were n't . I do n't see what I could have been thinking of . I sat where Miss Eastwood is .</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD . Yes , and I was next to Mr. Trent , between Philip and Mr. Trent . I felt sure I was in the wrong seat . ( Rises . )</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( quite casually ) . Then perhaps you ladies will exchange places .</stage>
   <stage>( ROSALIE gives a little sigh of relief when she sees that DONOHUE attaches no importance to the substitution she has made , and sits down again . HELEN and Miss EASTWOOD , change seats . HELEN crosses outside of circle . )</stage>
   <stage>Now we 're all right , are n't we ? ( Slight buzz of conversation . ) You are quite sure that you are all in the places you occupied during the séance ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Yes . I think so .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( puts his hand on the empty chair ) . We 'll pretend that Mr. Wales is still sitting here . ( Slight movement from all . ) Now , Mr. Crosby , I 'll ask you to tell me what happened after the séance began . But first I 'll ask you this question , was there any special arrangement about the seats ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( hurriedly rising ) . There was not , sir . I told them that they could sit anywhere they did wish . Young Mr. Crosby must ‘ ave sat by the light on purpose . And I am so sorry I did make the mistake about the young ladies . I do not know ‘ ow I came to make a mistake like that .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Oh , well , if they could n't remember where they sat , I do n't see how I can expect you to be entirely accurate . ( ROSALIE sits in arm-chair up C .) However , we 're all right now . Now , Mr. Crosby .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Well , after Madame la Grange had shown how she broke out of —</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . We 'll start with the séance . ( All look at DONOHUE . ) I know how mediums break the circle and all that . And you need n't describe how she went into that trance of hers .</stage>
   <stage>MASON . Inspector , I do n't think you 're fair to this woman . I think there 's something pretty important that you have n't been told .</stage>
   <stage>( All look at MASON . )</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Then you 'd better tell me now .</stage>
   <stage>MASON . In order that there should be no deception , we had Madame la Grange searched .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . I see .</stage>
   <stage>MASON . And while she was out of the room —</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Oh , she left the room ?</stage>
   <stage>( All look at DONOHUE . )</stage>
   <stage>MASON . Yes , and all of the ladies went with her . Then someone suggested that we ask Madame la Grange about some special thing , and Mr. Wales said he was going to ask her to get in communication with Spencer Lee and see if we could n't find out who killed him —</stage>
   <stage>STANDISH . Most ridiculous thing —</stage>
   <stage>MASON . As soon as she went into her trance , or whatever it was , Spencer Lee 's spirit tried to talk to us .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . She began to give you messages from Spencer Lee without knowing that this was what you were trying to get ?</stage>
   <stage>MASON ( in triumph ) . Exactly . And there 's no use in trying to tell me that there 's nothing in spiritualism , because now I know better .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Thank you very much , Mr. Mason . What you 've told me is extremely important . I 'm anxious to know what was said , because I 'm a good deal interested in the Spencer Lee case myself .</stage>
   <stage>( MRS. TRENT turns and faces door , still sitting in her chair . )</stage>
   <stage>MASON . Then you think there 's something in this spiritualism . I never did until to-day , but , by Jove , you know you can n't explain this any other way .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Madame la Grange went into a trance . We 'll grant that much , anyway . What happened then ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . After a few minutes she began talking to us in the voice of a little child .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . That was Laughing Eyes , my spirit control .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Just what did Laughing Eyes say ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . It was all mixed up ; none of it very clear . But she seemed to be trying to talk for someone to someone . She kept calling for Ned . Then suddenly she spoke deeply , in a man 's voice .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Did the man 's message have any importance ? I mean , did it seem to make sense ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . It was perfectly coherent at any rate . I can n't give you the exact words , but —</stage>
   <stage>MASON ( interrupting ) . I can . He said , “ Ned — I want Ned . Why in Hell do n't Ned answer me ? ”</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( standing at lower end of table B . ) . And did anyone answer ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Eventually Wales replied .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . I want you all to be extremely careful in what you tell me . I do n't want any surmises . In the first place , did the message come for anyone but Mr. Wales ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . There was at no time mention of Wales ’ name . The calls were always for “ Ned . ”</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . I see . Did anyone else answer the calls ?</stage>
   <stage>STANDISH . I asked two or three questions , but no attention was paid to them .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . What did Mr. Wales say to all this ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . I do n't think Mr. Wales spoke at all until the message about saving his life came .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . And after that ?</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD . There was a regular conversation between them .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Then there was some mention about some letters . I remember , too , that Mr. Wales said , “ Are you trying to tell me who killed you ? ”</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . What was the reply to that ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY . All we got were the words , “ Ask — ask — ask . ”</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . And then I said , “ Do you know who killed you ? ”</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Did you get an answer ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Not directly . The message was another cry for “ Ned . ”</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . What happened then ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Then Mr. Wales said , “ Do you know who killed you ? ”</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( eagerly ) . What answer did he get ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . None . The medium began to moan and cry . Then Mr. Wales asked her again and again for the name . He kept crying , “ Tell me who killed you ; I want the name . ” He must have asked her two or three times . Then he cried out that he was hurt .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . And then ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . That 's all .</stage>
   <stage>( Enter DUNN from door L .)</stage>
   <stage>DUNN . The matron is here now , sir .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Just a minute . Just one more question , Mr. Crosby . Did you get the impression that if Mr. Wales had not been killed his question would have been answered ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . If you grant that the séance was real , it would be impossible to arrive at any other conclusion .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . It was well established in your mind that Wales was the only person able to get a message ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Yes .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . It follows then that he was killed in order to prevent his question being answered .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . That 's the impression I got .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . This leads to the conclusion that whoever killed Wales knew who had killed Spencer Lee .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . I should think so .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( front of table R .) . And it is not difficult to surmise that the person who killed Wales was actuated by the strongest of all motives — self-protection . So in all human probability the murderer of Wales was also the murderer of Spencer Lee . You see , ladies and gentlemen , that by the use of a little patience we have come a long way in our investigation . ( There is a long pause . ) I do n't wish to put you all through the humiliation of a search . I should like to end this inquiry here and now . ( Moves a step R. There is another pause . ) No ? Then we 'll have to go on . ( Moves briskly to below table R .) There is a police matron in the other room who will search the ladies of the party . Sergeant Dunn will perform a similar duty with the men . Mike , you will take them one at a time . It makes no difference to me in what order they go .</stage>
   <stage>MASON . Well , I 've got nothing to conceal . ( He rises and places chair up L ., then moves to door L .)</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Neither ‘ ave I . ( She rises and moves down C .)</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . I 'd rather you waited for a few minutes , Madame la Grange . ( ROSALIE looks at him sharply . ) Any of the other ladies will do .</stage>
   <stage>MRS. CROSBY ( rising ) . Suppose I set the others a good example .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Thank you very much . ( MRS. CROSBY comes down C ., then crosses to door L. DONOHUE looks at the others , where they are still seated . ) And thank you all for the great help you 've given me . You need not sit there any longer , unless you wish .</stage>
   <stage>( MISS STANDISH crosses R. to back of table R. MRS. CROSBY , MASON , and SERGEANT DUNN go out L. DUNN closes the door . HELEN goes up C. TRENT moves one chair up to L. of door L. C ., then one chair to R. of door L. C ., right back of chesterfield C. MISS ERSKINE crosses to back of table R. MRS. TRENT seated R. C . WILLIAM in front of chesterfield C .)</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD ( crossing to DONOHUE R .) . Inspector , I think you 're perfectly wonderful .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Oh , we have n't done very much yet , Miss Eastwood . Give the police a little time . ( He turns and crosses to L. C . With an abrupt change of tone . ) Madame la Grange , there 's a question I wish to ask you .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( coming down to L. C . ) . Anything at all , sir .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( L. C . ) . When Mr. Wales asked you for the name , why did n't you answer him ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . I do not know . I was in a trance . ( She moves down L .) .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Then you did n't hear the question .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . How could I ?</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . I did n't ask you that . I want to know why you did n't answer him .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . I ‘ ave already told you , I was in a trance . I did not know what was going on .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Why did n't you tell the name that you had agreed with Wales you would tell ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( L. C ., astonished ) . Agreed ?</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . You heard what I said . ( There is a pause . ) Well , why did n't you carry out your part of the bargain ? ( CROSBY moves to front of chesterfield C .) Why did n't you give him the name as you 'd planned ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . I do not know what you do mean .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . My words are perfectly plain . I asked you why you did n't carry out your part of the bargain ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . There was not any bargain ?</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Your whole séance was a fake . ( Slight movement from others . ) It was not only planned but rehearsed between you and Wales . He thought that a woman had killed his friend . He told you about it , and asked your help to discover the murderer ,</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . I do not know what you talk about .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( ignoring her reply ) . Every detail of this séance was planned . When he asked you the name you were to tell him the name of a woman —</stage>
   <stage>( MRS. TRENT moves up R. and joins TRENT and MISS ERSKINE at table R .)</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Inspector , I ‘ ave never ‘ eard one word of this before ,</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Not a word ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Not a word .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( L. C ., taking paper out of the inside pocket of his coat , and reading aloud ) . “ What do you want ? Answer . Do n't forget the swimming pool . Do n't ever forget the swimming pool . Do you mean the time he went in after me ? When we were little boys . Spencer Lee says he can n't rest . ” And so on and so on , down to . “ Do you know who killed you ? ” ( He turns to the others . ) The answer to that should have been “ Yes . ” What did she say ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( now in front of table R .) . She did n't answer that question .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( looks at paper again L. C . ) . The next question is , “ Can you tell the name ? ” And then she was to have told that woman 's name . Just the first name . Mrs. Crosby , what did she reply to that question ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . She moaned and cried .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . What did she say after that ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Nothing . She moaned again and came out of the so-called trance .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Why did n't you do as you agreed ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( down L. C ., left side of DONOHUE . Stonily ) . I do not know what you talk about .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . The police know that some woman killed Spencer Lee . Something was taken from the inside pocket of his coat . We think it was a package of letters . This woman left traces . We have her finger-prints — many of them . Eventually we 'll find her . For three or four weeks Mr. Wales has been working among the people who knew Lee . His theory was that this woman wanted to get back her letters — in fact , did get them back . He felt reasonably sure that he had found the woman — that one of you ladies here to-night is probably the woman we are hunting . He thought that he could play on her superstitious fears , and that when her name seemingly came from the spirit of the dead man she would confess . He told Madame la Grange the name , explained to her just what he wanted , and together he and I worked out the exact wording of the messages that were supposed to come from Spencer Lee 's spirit . ( He turns suddenly to ROSALIE , who is down L. C . ) You agreed to all this ; why did n't you speak the name ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . I do not know anything about it . He — he must ‘ ave forgotten to tell it to me .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Oh , no , he did n't .</stage>
   <stage>( MISS EASTWOOD down in front of table R .)</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( with great decision ) . There was no name . He did not tell to me any name .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . My good woman , you must n't take me for a fool . You agreed to use a certain name ; you came here for that purpose , and then after you got here , something happened to make you change your plans . Something unexpected happened . ( He stops for a moment ; turns to MISS EASTWOOD . ) Miss Eastwood , what did you say was your first name ?</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD . Mary .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( to MISS ERSKINE ) . And yours ?</stage>
   <stage>MISS ERSKINE ( back of table R .) . Elizabeth .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Yours ?</stage>
   <stage>MISS STANDISH . Grace .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Mr. Crosby , your wife 's name is ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Alicia .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Mrs. Trent ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. TRENT ( R. C . ) . Helen .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE , Miss O'Neill ?</stage>
   <stage>HELEN ( up C ., in front of chesterfield ) . Helen .</stage>
   <stage>( There is a long pause . )</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( L. C . WILLIAM comes to HELEN C .) . Helen , I see . So there are two Helens . Two Helens . ( He stands looking first at one and then at the other of the two women . ) Mr. Crosby , when Madame la Grange first came to-night , did she show any surprise at seeing any of the people here ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( R. C . ) . Not that I noticed .</stage>
   <stage>MISS EASTWOOD ( below table R .) . Oh , yes , she did . Miss O'Neill was n't in the room when she arrived . Later when she came in Madame la Grange seemed upset ; she said something to her that none of us could hear . Then I remember she argued with Mr. Wales and said she did n't feel like having a séance .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Now we 're getting it .</stage>
   <stage>( WILLIAM stands R. of HELEN O'NEILL up C .)</stage>
   <stage>Everything was going along smoothly , until Miss O'Neill came in . The extra Helen . ( He turns to CROSBY . ) Mr. Crosby , your daughter was in the room when Madame la Grange came in ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Yes .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . You noticed nothing unusual in this woman 's manner ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . I 'd never seen her before .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . I mean , she did nothing to attract your attention ; the fact that Helen Trent was in the room made no impression on her ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Seemingly not .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Then Helen O'Neill came in . ( Goes up to HELEN C ., then crosses down to ROSALIE L. Sharply to her . ) Rosalie la Grange , what 's that girl to you ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Nothing at all .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( C .) . Nothing at all ! Then why did you try to deceive me as to where she sat . Why did you place her so that I would not know she was sitting next to Mr. Wales when he was stabbed ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . It was just my mistake . I did not do it on purpose .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . I 'm afraid that wo n't do . It 's perfectly apparent that the name you were to speak was — Helen , What 's the use of lying to me ! You 've tried your best to shield this girl . I want to know why .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . There 's no reason . I never saw the young lady before in all my life .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . What 's that girl to you ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Nothing , nothing at all —</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( starts to ROSALIE ) . Damn you , you old harridan , you come across —</stage>
   <stage>HELEN ( springing forward from up R. C . down to L. C . and pushing DONOHUE up stage ) . Let my mother alone , let my mother alone .</stage>
   <stage>( She goes to ROSALIE , puts her arms around her . Pause . ROSALIE weeps . )</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( very quietly ) . I thought perhaps I 'd get it that way .</stage>
   <stage>HELEN ( getting L. side of ROSALIE ) . There , there , dear , it 's all right , it 's all right .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( with a grim smile , coming down C .) . Of course it 's all right ! We 've got the finger-prints and —</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM ( interrupting him — coming down to C .) . If you think for one minute I 'm going to let you —</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . My boy , wait ! ( grabbing him and pinning down his arms to his sides C .) . Think what —</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Think nothing . ( He shakes himself free and goes to DONOHUE L. C . ) That 's the girl I love , and I 'll be damned if I let you take her finger-prints .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Young man , do n't be a fool . I 'm sorry , but it 's too clear .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( breaking away from her daughter and moving to DONOHUE C .) . Clear — how is it too clear ? Inspector , you are never going to accuse my little girl of a thing like that ?</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( C .) . She was next to him ; she had only to free one hand and strike , and then take his hand again !</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . There was something else she had to do before she could ever do that . She had to have murder in her heart .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Well ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( turns suddenly ; seizes her daughter by the hand , turns her to him . ROSALIE stays between DONOHUE and HELEN ) . Look at ‘ er . Look in ‘ er eyes — look at the face of ‘ er . Is there murder there ? ‘ Ave you not eyes in your ‘ ead .</stage>
   <stage>( DUNN enters from L .)</stage>
   <stage>DUNN . It 's not on either of them .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . I know where it is . Tell the matron she 'll find the knife on this girl .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( to DONOHUE C .) . Inspector , I will tell to you anything I know , only keep your hands off my little girl . I did come ‘ ere like you say , and when I see my little girl I lose my ‘ ead . I tried to save ‘ er and I ‘ ave made it worse . You ‘ ave looked at ‘ er , the poor young thing that would not ‘ arm a fly , and you think she could do a thing like that .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Yes .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( still crying bitterly ) . Then , Inspector Donohue , you are a damn fool , and with God 's ‘ elp I will prove it .</stage>
   <p>CURTAIN .</p>
   <p>ACT III</p>
   <stage>The same SCENE half an hour later .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE is discovered by table R .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Father in ‘ Eaven , help me . My little girl is in terrible trouble and there is not anyone to ‘ elp ‘ er but me . She is a good girl — you know all things , you know she is a good girl . Show me the way . I ‘ ave been a fakir all my life . I ‘ ave tricked them and fooled them , but I ‘ ave never meant to ‘ arm a soul , I ‘ ave never done ‘ arm to any person . And there is a power . It ‘ as come to me before , a power that I could not understand . I felt it , and I showed it . Oh God , give it to me again . Do this for my little girl , for the sake of your Son . Amen .</stage>
   <stage>( Turns and goes up stage and then to the window at R. She pulls up the blind and raises the window . The light comes up from the street lamp , throwing out her figure in strong silhouette , and showing a square patch of light on the ceiling . In the C. of this patch , sticking point up in the heavy wooden panelling , can be seen the knife . ROSALIE stands for a few moments looking out at the night . DONOHUE enters down L. He turns on the lights from the switch below the door down L .)</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( crosses to L. C . ) . Who turned off the lights ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( at window R .) . I did , sir .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Why ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . I was praying . ( Coming to above table R .)</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Praying ? What for ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Guidance .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( with a laugh ) . I hope you get it .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( with conviction ) . I will , sir , I will . ( She starts toward the door L .) I will join the others now .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . I think 'd you better wait . ( Calls off L .) Mike !</stage>
   <stage>( ROSALIE is C. DUNN enters from L .)</stage>
   <stage>DUNN . Yes , Inspector .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Did Madame la Grange see you as she came in here ?</stage>
   <stage>DUNN ( down L .) . No , sir . I followed your instructions and kept out of sight .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( L. C . ) . How long has she been here ?</stage>
   <stage>DUNN . About ten minutes .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Time enough for her to find what we could n't .</stage>
   <stage>DUNN . I 'll bet she 's got it .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Take her to Mrs. MacPherson . She 's not to go near anyone or speak to anyone . Tell Mrs. Mac to search her . ( He turns to ROSALIE , who is C .) Unless , of course , you want to give up that knife now .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . I ‘ ave not any knife , and I ‘ ave been searched once .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( L. C . ) . Exactly , and then you were allowed to come back into this room . We 're rather anxious to see what you 've found while you were in here . Well ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . I ‘ ave found nothing that would be any good to you .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . I 'm the best judge of that . What was it you found ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . I found comfort , sir . A feeling that the innocent would come to no ‘ arm .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( dryly ) . Take her to Mrs. MacPherson . Come back as soon as you turn her over to the matron .</stage>
   <stage>DUNN . Yes , Inspector . Come on — come on , you .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( crossing L .) . I will come !</stage>
   <stage>( They go out . He stands looking after them for about five seconds , when DUNN re-enters and says :)</stage>
   <stage>DUNN ( above door L .) . Mrs. Mac 's got her .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . She turned out that light . I wonder why ? What did she want in the dark .</stage>
   <stage>( He goes over toward the light switch at L. and puts out his hand . He stops suddenly as his attention is attracted by a POLICEMAN coming feet foremost down the chimney . DONOHUE gives a little start and then comes L. C . The POLICEMAN jumps down all the way in fireplace , and comes into the room to console table L. end of chesterfield . His uniform is covered with soot , and so are his face and hands . DUNN goes down L. below door . )</stage>
   <stage>DUNN . I sent him to see if they 'd hidden that knife up there ?</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Good . ( To POLICEMAN . ) Find anything ?</stage>
   <stage>POLICEMAN . Nothing but dirt . Who pays for this uniform ?</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . You do n't , anyway . Could you hear anything while you were up there ?</stage>
   <stage>POLICEMAN . Not a thing .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . You are sure ?</stage>
   <stage>POLICEMAN . Certain .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Go and get a bath .</stage>
   <stage>POLICEMAN . ‘ Tai n't Saturday .</stage>
   <stage>( He exits at L. DONOHUE crosses R . Pause . )</stage>
   <stage>DUNN ( down L. After a pause ) . Do n't it beat Hell ?</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Why ?</stage>
   <stage>DUNN . That knife could n't have flew away .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( coming C .) . We 'll find it eventually . It 's in this room somewhere .</stage>
   <stage>DUNN . No , sir , it ai n't .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Where have you looked ?</stage>
   <stage>DUNN . Everywhere .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Not hidden in the furniture ?</stage>
   <stage>DUNN . I 'll gamble it ai n't . Took up all the rugs , shook ‘ em . Dug through the upholstery in the furniture , looked back of mat on the wall . It 's not in the bric-à-brac , or whatever these swells call their jugs .</stage>
   <stage>( DONOHUE crosses towards table R .)</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Unless we find it on the old woman , it 's still in this room .</stage>
   <stage>DUNN . I suppose you noticed that she opened the window .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( upper end of table R .) . Yes , I noticed that . Mike , you 've the makings of a great detective .</stage>
   <stage>DUNN . I 'm a darned good detective now .</stage>
   <stage>( DONOHUE goes to window at R. and calls out . )</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Say , Doolan ! See anything ?</stage>
   <stage>DOOLAN ( outside window R .) . A woman put up the window just now . She stood there a while looking up in the air . ( Pause . ) Watching the stars , I guess .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Have anything in her hand ?</stage>
   <stage>DOOLAN . No , sir . The light from this lamp was shinin ’ right on her . I could see everything .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Throw anything out of the window ?</stage>
   <stage>DOOLAN . No , Inspector .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . All right . You 're to arrest anyone leaving the house .</stage>
   <stage>DOOLAN . I gotcha .</stage>
   <stage>( DONOHUE comes below table R. and turns to DUNN . Crosses to L. C . )</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . We 'll find the knife eventually . We 've got to . Get me Mr. Crosby , the O'Neill girl — that 's the order I want to see them in here .</stage>
   <stage>( DUNN exits L. DONOHUE crosses up R. end of chesterfield to chest up R ., starts to cross L. below chesterfield . CROSBY enters down L. and closes the door . DONOHUE comes down to C. by R. end of chesterfield . )</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( L. C . ) . Your man told me to come here .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Yes . Sorry to have to give orders in your house . If you do n't like it I can take everyone down to Police Headquarters . You know what will happen — what the newspapers will do if I take all these ladies and gentlemen down town . In the end this way will be the best for you and your friends . Well , how about it ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( L. C . ) . Thank you . I think you 'd better regard this house as your own for the present .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( C .) . All right . If you do n't mind I 'll use this room as a headquarters for the present .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . I have already told you to use this house as your own .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Thank you . Good evening .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( with a laugh ) . I 'm dismissed ?</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . You 're dismissed . ( CROSBY walks toward door L .) Why did Wales object to the engagement of your son and Helen O'Neill ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( turns to DONOHUE ) . Who told you that ? ( Moving a few steps . )</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . It does n't matter . I know that he did . Why ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( turning front ) . I can n't talk about it .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( C .) . All right . You 're the best judge of that . Only I 'm attaching a great deal of importance to this fact . If I 'm unduly emphasizing its value , do n't you think you 'd better set me straight about it ?</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . What possible bearing can it have on —</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Motive , my dear sir , motive .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Come now . You can n't think that this girl killed Wales because she heard him ask us to wait before we sanctioned her engagement to my son .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . She did hear Mr. Wales make that objection . That 's just what I wanted to know .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( L .) . I think I 'd better send for my lawyer .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( C .) . Well , you can do as you like about that . Frankly , I do n't understand your attitude at all . I can appreciate your desire to spare your son all the unhappiness that you can . But if this young woman killed Wales and Lee , the sooner we find it out the better for you and your family .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Oddly enough I was thinking only of Miss O'Neill at the moment .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . You 'd better think of yourself and your family first . ( Moves R. a few steps . )</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . That 's for me to decide . I certainly am not going to allow that child to be bullied and badgered in the usual police fashion . ( Moves R. a step . )</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . You 're going to do as you are told , sir . If you warn that girl , if you caution her in any way , I 'll drag every one of you down town . You and your wife and your son and the girl and all your friends . Be reasonable , Mr. Crosby . If the girl is innocent , telling me the truth wo n't hurt her . If she 's guilty , and I think she is , by God , I 'm going to drag the truth out of her and her mother . ( There is a knock on the door down L .) Come in .</stage>
   <stage>( HELEN enters L .)</stage>
   <stage>HELEN ( L .) . You wanted me ?</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Yes , come in . Sit down , please .</stage>
   <stage>( Indicating chair below table R. HELEN crosses and sits . CROSBY starts to move R .)</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Helen —</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . What you are planning to do , Mr. Crosby , will only make matters worse , I promised you that .</stage>
   <stage>( After a moment 's pause CROSBY exits L. and leaves door open . DONOHUE turns , closes door and turns sharply to HELEN . Crosses towards the table . )</stage>
   <stage>Now then , young woman , let 's hear what you 've got to say .</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . Nothing .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( C .) . Nothing ? I do n't suppose it 's necessary for me to tell you that you 're under grave suspicion .</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . No , I realize that .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Now , the best way to help yourself if you 're innocent is to be quite frank with me . ( She simply looks at him , but does not speak . ) Well ?</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . I 've already told you that there is nothing that I can say .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Someone has advised you not to answer me . Who was it ? ( There is a pause . ) You 'd better tell me . ( Moves R. C . )</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . I am not going to answer any of your questions .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . I told you that if you were innocent , nothing that you could say would hurt you . If you 're guilty — well that 's a different matter .</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . You know that I did n't do it .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( in front of table R .) . Well , there you are . Why not answer my question then ? The sooner we find out who is guilty the sooner you 'll be freed from suspicion . You see that , do n't you ?</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . Yes .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( brings chair and sits in front of table R .) . Now we 're getting along . How well did you know Spencer Lee ? ( HELEN does not answer him — looking front . ) You 'd better make up your mind to talk . Do you hear ? ( HELEN does not speak . Losing his temper . ) Why , you little fool , do you think you can fight me ? ( He turns sharply to face her , turning his back on the door at L .) You were the last person to see Spencer Lee alive . Yes , and you saw him dead , too . You heard Wales threaten to tell these fine people what he knew about you ; you knew he 'd prevent your marriage to this young millionaire , and then —</stage>
   <stage>( ROSALIE enters quietly from L. and stands for a moment watching them . )</stage>
   <stage>When your chance came in the dark you killed him . Now then , you come across with the truth .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . She 'll come across with nothing . ( Crosses R. to table . )</stage>
   <stage>( DONOHUE rises and stands by table R. C . HELEN rises . )</stage>
   <stage>You said that she was the one that did it and you would find the knife on ‘ er . Well , you did not , did you ? You think that she is the person that killed Spencer Lee ?</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Yes .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Well , she is not . You say you ‘ ave the finger-prints of the girl who was in his rooms . Well , take ‘ er finger-prints and put them side by side with the others , and then you will see . I dare you to do that .</stage>
   <stage>HELEN ( with a cry ) . Mother — ( She stops suddenly . )</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . What were you going to say ?</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . Nothing .</stage>
   <stage>( DUNN enters with box and envelope . )</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . That 's very wise of you .</stage>
   <stage>DUNN . Got it , Inspector . ( Crosses to C .)</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( down R .) . Do they compare ?</stage>
   <stage>DUNN . To a T .</stage>
   <stage>( ROSALIE C ., HELEN down R. DONOHUE in front table between HELEN and ROSALIE . )</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . All right . Let me have ‘ em . Now ask Mr. Crosby and his son to come here at once .</stage>
   <stage>( DUNN turns and exits L. DONOHUE up C. crosses to back of table R .)</stage>
   <stage>I already have your daughter 's finger-prints , Madame la Grange .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . ‘ Ave you really ? ... You are very smart .</stage>
   <stage>( HELEN crosses to ROSALIE R. C . ROSALIE puts her arms about the girl and swings her L. of her . When DONOHUE opens box at the back of table CROSBY and WILLIAM enter from L. accompanied by DUNN . )</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . That 's all , Mike .</stage>
   <stage>( DUNN exits L. and closes door . CROSBY L. of HELEN . WILLIAM L. of CROSBY . )</stage>
   <stage>Mr. Crosby , I told you that I 'd settle this case in a few minutes . The end has come sooner than I thought . I am now ready to make an arrest . I have sent for you and your son because — ( He suddenly turns toward HELEN . ) This is the woman we have been hunting .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . That is a lie ! ( R. end of chesterfield . )</stage>
   <stage>( WILLIAM goes to HELEN . )</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( picking up cup and holding it out toward them ) . Here is the cup —</stage>
   <stage>( CROSBY crosses down R. to below table — moves chair over R .)</stage>
   <stage>which we took from Spencer Lee 's rooms . These are the finger-prints of the woman who used it . ( Ignoring CROSBY for the moment . ) Here is the saucer that she used . More finger-prints . A few minutes ago I sent this young woman a note . The man who gave it to her wore gloves , so did I when I addressed the envelope . Hers are the only naked hands that have touched it . ( He picks up the envelope gingerly by one corner , and holds it outward to them . ) They are unquestionably Helen O'Neill ' s finger-prints . ( HELEN is in WILLIAM 'S arms . DONOHUE puts down the envelope . Then he picks up the cup and points to the finger-marks on it . ) And so , Mr. Crosby , are these . There can be no doubt about it . There is never any doubt about this method of identification . In twenty years there has never been one mistake . We now have what we 've been hunting for : the woman who went to Spencer Lee 's rooms .</stage>
   <stage>( DONOHUE steps back with a little gesture of triumph . CROSBY stands staring at the girl . ROSALIE comes to R. of HELEN , turns to her . )</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( C .) . Look at me , my darling . Look at your mother . ( She takes HELEN 'S face in her hands and looks at her closely . Then with a little cry of contentment stands R. of HELEN . ROSALIE and HELEN back up to chesterfield . ) Now , darling , you must not be frightened . Look up , child . Why do not you say something ?</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . I can n't .</stage>
   <stage>( Sits on chesterfield . DONOHUE gives a short laugh . )</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . What can she say ?</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM ( going to her ) . Dear , tell him it 's a lie .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Wait . Let me talk to her . ( CROSBY comes over to HELEN and sits beside her on the chesterfield , R. side . WILLIAM is at L . end . ) My dear , you understand that none of us believe — what the Inspector wants us to believe . We know that you have never done anything — that you are no more guilty of this atrocious crime than I am . We all want to help you . We believe in you and trust you and love you . You understand that , do n't you ?</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . Yes .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . I wo n't have this .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . I 'm afraid you must , Will . ( He turns again to HELEN . ) We want to help you , so , my dear , you must be perfectly frank with us . Inspector Donohue says he can prove that you went to that man 's rooms . Is that true ?</stage>
   <stage>HELEN ( slowly and reluctantly ) . Yes .</stage>
   <stage>( DONOHUE gives a short laugh . Sits back of table R .)</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( R. of chesterfield ) . And what if she did ? She had a good errand . What did you go for , darling ?</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . I can n't tell you .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Dear , you must tell us . ( She looks at him suddenly . He comes over and kneels beside her and talks to her as if to a little child . ) My dear , it is n't that we do n't trust you . Surely you know how we all love you ? But we must know the truth — because we have to show him how wrong he is .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( seated back of table R .) . Yes , and I 'm waiting to be shown .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM ( kneeling L. of HELEN ) . Why did you go to Spencer Lee ?</stage>
   <stage>HELEN ( sitting on chesterfield ) . You must n't ask me that . I can n't tell you .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( still on chesterfield ) . But if you do n't tell us , how can we help you ?</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . I did n't do anything , I did n't do anything .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . We know that , my child . But why did you go ? ( HELEN does not answer . ) Did you know Spencer Lee ?</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Of course she did n't .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( seated back of table R .) . Why do n't she speak for herself ?</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Because I 'll speak for her .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Ca n't you answer even that question ?</stage>
   <stage>( HELEN shakes her head and makes a despairing gesture . )</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . But , dear , do n't you see what they 'll think ? Helen , you must tell me .</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . Could I speak to mother , alone ? ( She rises . )</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . You cannot .</stage>
   <stage>( CROSBY and WILLIAM rise . CROSBY moves to L. end of chesterfield . )</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( R. end of chesterfield ) . Where is the ‘ arm in that ? A child ‘ as the right to talk to ‘ er own mother any time she does want .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Anything you wish to say you can say in front of me .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( coming to HELEN C .) . Darling , you need not mind the nice Inspector . I well know that there was never anything in your mind that you could not say before all the world . ( There is a pause . ) Tell your mother , my darling .</stage>
   <stage>( CROSBY is now C. WILLIAM stands below him C .)</stage>
   <stage>HELEN ( beginning to cry ) . I can n't . I can n't .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( C .) . Stop , there ‘ as been crying enough . I did lose my ‘ ead through that . Stop crying or I will beat you . ( She too begins to cry and takes her daughter in her arms again . ) There , there , my dear . Your mother is not going to let anyone ‘ urt you — not anyone at all . ( They cry together for a moment , and then ROSALIE gets her self-control back . She blows her nose vigorously . ) We will both be the better for that . Now then , tell me .</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . Mother , I can n't .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( R. C . ) . Who did you promise you would not ?</stage>
   <stage>HELEN ( surprised ) . Why , how did you —</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . She is shielding someone .</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . No . No .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . That is the first lie you ‘ ave ever told me . I want to know who it is you are shielding ? ( HELEN does not answer . ROSALIE suddenly turns to WILLIAM . ) She is your girl ?</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM ( L. C . ) . Yes .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Then make her tell .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM ( to HELEN C .) . Nell dear , you must —</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . Billy , I can n't .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( drops down L. of group ) . My dear , even if you 're protecting someone else , I think you ought to tell us .</stage>
   <stage>HELEN ( with a sudden outburst ) . Why are you all against me ? Why are you all trying to make me break my —</stage>
   <stage>( Moves to R. end of chesterfield . WILLIAM comes to her . CROSBY is L. C . )</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( interrupting HELEN , coming to R. C . ) . Break your word ? You shall not . You need not tell . I know it myself now — I ‘ ave been blind . ( She turns suddenly on the INSPECTOR — moves to down table R ., above him . ) You are the one that found out there was two Helens . The extra Helen , you said . Well , please to send for the other Helen and ask her .</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . Mother , stop !</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Stop ? I will not .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( C .) . Wait , please . Is it my daughter you 're protecting ? ( HELEN does not answer . ) Because if it is — - much as we love her — my dear , we can n't accept that sacrifice from you . I 'm her father , and you must tell me the truth . Did my daughter send you ? ( There is a long pause . ) Did you go for my daughter ?</stage>
   <stage>HELEN ( slowly ) . Yes .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . I did know it . ( Above table R .)</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . My daughter sent you . What for ?</stage>
   <stage>HELEN ( R. C . ) . Some letters .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM ( in front of chesterfield C .) . Why did n't she go herself ?</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . She was afraid .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( still seated back of table R .) . Well , go on .</stage>
   <stage>( HELEN does not speak . )</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM ( R. C . ) . Tell him , dear , it 's all right .</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . I do n't know what to say .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Why not tell the truth ? ( Rises and comes to chair below table R .)</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Tell the Inspector what happened , dearie . ( Putting HELEN in chair front of table R .)</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . Nothing happened . That 's the funny part of it . The minute Mr. Lee understood that I knew about the letters , everything was changed . I said that unless he gave them to me I 'd tell Mr. Crosby about them . He seemed terribly upset . He said he had n't meant to frighten Helen . That he loved her , and was desperate . I thought it was a funny kind of love , but I did n't tell him that . Then he gave me the letters .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Was this before or after you had tea with him ?</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . Before .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Go on . He gave you the letters ?</stage>
   <stage>HELEN ( seated in front of table R .) . Yes . And he seemed terribly unhappy . He begged me to stay and talk to him for a few minutes , and I did . He asked me to have some tea with him , and I did that too .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . How charming ! What did you do after tea ?</stage>
   <stage>( ROSALIE is at the back of the chair in the front of the table . )</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . I came home and gave Helen her letters .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . And that 's all ?</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . That 's all .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Why did you do this ?</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . She 's Billy 's sister .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . My compliments , young woman . That was beautifully done . And she looks so innocent too .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM ( C ) . You do n't believe —</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Not a word of it . Not one word .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . And why not ?</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . That I do n't is sufficient . Her story is preposterous . Your daughter 's —</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . It is the truth .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Do you expect me to believe for a minute that a man like Lee would threaten your daughter , and then when a total stranger comes to him and asks for the letters , give them up without a word ? Why , no jury in the world would believe your story .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Jury ? You 're not going to arrest her ?</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . She is arrested .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . You ‘ ave not proof .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( below table R .) . All the proof that I need . If she was innocent , why did n't she tell me all this when I first questioned her ? Why did she wait until she knew that I had proof — that she had been in Spencer Lee 's rooms ?</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . She was protecting my sister .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Women do n't hang together like that .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( upper end of table R .) . Oh , they do , they do ! The poor creatures !</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( down R .) . They do not . I know them . ( He turns to WILLIAM . ) She was n't protecting your sister . She was protecting herself . She went for the letters , of course ; and they had tea before she asked for them , not afterwards .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( R. C . to L. of WILLIAM ) . How do you know that ?</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . She could n't take tea with a man she 's just killed .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Why , damn you — ( Starts R .)</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( grabbing WILLIAM by shoulders ) . Billy !</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM ( breaks up stage a few steps , then down stage again ) . I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to lose my temper . I suppose we 've got to take this thing calmly . Inspector , you honestly believe that Nelly killed this man ?</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Yes .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Why should she ?</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . She was engaged to you — he had compromising letters she had written to him — he was threatening her with exposure — she went to get her letters . They had tea together — she 's admitted that , after we proved it , and then when he would n't give up her letters she killed him . So much for the first murder . ( Turns away . ) Now for the second : she was sitting next to Wales ; he had already threatened her with exposure ; in another minute the medium would have told her name as that of the person who had been at Spencer Lee 's rooms . She pulled her hand away from his , struck and took his hand again . ( There is a pause . ) Young man , you 'll have a hard time tearing apart that chain of evidence .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Except for the fact that she did never write the man a letter in ‘ er life , it is a grand case you ‘ ave , Inspector .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM ( down C. a step . CROSBY goes above WILLIAM C .) . Of course . Dad , we 've lost our brains . She did n't go for her own letters . ( WILLIAM turns to the INSPECTOR . ) You were talking of juries . Do you think any jury will believe that a young girl would kill a man to get back another woman 's letters for her ? ( He starts toward door L .)</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Where are you going ?</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . To get my sister .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Wait . ( WILLIAM stops . ) I 'll send for Mrs. Trent .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM ( crosses L. C . ) . But I want to ask her —</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( interrupting him ) . I 'll ask my own questions . If you want to help this investigation , you might call Sergeant Dunn for me .</stage>
   <stage>( WILLIAM opens door at L .)</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Sergeant Dunn , the Inspector wants you . ( He turns back to the girl , and DUNN enters L .)</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Ask Mrs. Trent to come here .</stage>
   <stage>( DUNN exits at L. ROSALIE is at the R. end of chesterfield . HELEN is in the chair in front of the table R. WILLIAM C. CROSBY walks up L ., then back to L. C . DONOHUE below the table looking at them with a grim smile . After a pause of about ten seconds MRS. TRENT and TRENT enter from L ., followed by DUNN , who stands below the door . )</stage>
   <stage>I sent for Mrs. Trent .</stage>
   <stage>TRENT ( L. C . ) . I know that . What do you want to see her about ?</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Mrs. Trent , did you ask this girl to go to Spencer Lee 's rooms to get letters you had written to him ?</stage>
   <stage>TRENT ( L. of MRS. TRENT ) . Did she what ?</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Did you , Mrs. Trent ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. TRENT ( L. C . ) . Certainly not .</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . Why — ( Rises from chair in front of table R .)</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( sternly ) . Keep still , you . ( To MRS . TRENT . ) Are you sure ?</stage>
   <stage>TRENT ( L. of MRS. TRENT ) . Of course she 's sure .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Mr. Trent , you must stop these interruptions . ( To MRS . TRENT . ) Will you please answer my question ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. TRENT . I never wrote a letter to Spencer Lee in my life . ( She suddenly turns to HELEN . ) How dare you say I sent you there ?</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . You did ! You did ! ( In front of table . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. TRENT ( down L. C . ) . I do n't know what she 's told you , Inspector , but —</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Never mind what she told me . I want to be very sure of this . You did not ask this girl to go to Spencer Lee 's rooms ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. TRENT . No .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( down R .) . He had no letters of yours ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. TRENT ( L. C . ) . No .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Do you know whether this girl had written to him ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. TRENT . I do n't know anything about it .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM ( coming L. of MRS. TRENT . CROSBY comes C .) . But Nell did n't know Lee , and you did , Helen .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( still down R .) . How about that , Mrs. Trent ?</stage>
   <stage>MRS. TRENT . I had n't seen Mr. Lee for two or three years . He used to come here a good deal . He wanted to marry me , but I did n't like him . And I certainly never wrote him letters of any sort . That is all I can tell you .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Thank you very much . That is all that I want to know .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM ( turning on his sister ) . You 're lying to save yourself . You 've got to tell the truth .</stage>
   <stage>TRENT . She is telling you the truth .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . She 's not .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY ( after a pause , putting his hand on his son 's shoulder ) . I 'm sorry , Billy .</stage>
   <stage>( WILLIAM goes up to chesterfield C. and sits . CROSBY looks coldly at HELEN and turns to his daughter . )</stage>
   <stage>MRS. TRENT . Father , you know that —</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Yes , dear , I know . Inspector , do you want us any more ?</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Not any more , thank you .</stage>
   <stage>CROSBY . Come then , children . ( He exits with MR. and MRS. TRENT down L .)</stage>
   <stage>( HELEN is still in front of the table R. As the door closes , DONOHUE crosses to L. C . )</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Mike , take her down town .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( C .) . I would not if I was you . Inspector , I do know who ‘ as done it .</stage>
   <stage>( WILLIAM rises . )</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( turning to ROSALIE C .) . You know ! Who was it ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . I cannot tell you yet . ( DONOHUE laughs . WILLIAM goes to HELEN . ) But I will ! I will !</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . Telling 's not enough . There 's just one thing that will convince me that she did n't kill Spencer Lee .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM ( down E .) . What , Inspector , what ?</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . The confession of the one who did . ( He turns to ROSALIE . ) Bring me that and I 'll set your daughter free .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( C .) . Inspector , give me a chance . Do not arrest my little girl . Give me time . I do know who ‘ as done it and I will get for you what you want .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE ( L. C . ) . Nonsense !</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( moves up to INSPECTOR ) . Give me one hour , sir . Keep them all here one hour more .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . No .</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM ( in front of table R .) . Give her a chance . We are all here — no one will get away . What difference will a few minutes make ?</stage>
   <stage>( There is a pause . DONOHUE takes out his watch and looks at it . )</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . I 'll give her ten minutes . Mike , tell Doolan again to arrest anyone trying to leave the house , and get on the front door yourself and stay there until I tell you . ( DUNN turns and exits at L .) You 've got just ten minutes .</stage>
   <stage>( He follows DUNN off L .)</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Ten minutes ! Ten minutes !</stage>
   <stage>( WILLIAM crosses to door L. and closes it . )</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM ( L. C . ) . Why did n't you tell who did it ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( C .) . How could I ? I ‘ ave no idea in the world . But I am going to find out . I am going to find out .</stage>
   <stage>HELEN ( B. C . ) . But how , mother , how ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Call them back . Make them all come , too . I want them all . ( HELEN runs off L .) Sir , run down into the ‘ all . Do you know which is Mr. Wales ’ overcoat ?</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Yes , I think so .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . See if you can find for me a glove or something of ‘ is — and ‘ urry , mon Dieu , ‘ urry !</stage>
   <stage>( WILLIAM runs off L. ROSALIE stands in thought for a moment , then she places a chair C. facing up stage . WILLIAM runs on again and hands her a glove . )</stage>
   <stage>Did you get it ?</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM ( L. C . ) . What are you going to do ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( L. C . ) . Trick them . Lie to them . It is for Nelly . Do you blame me ?</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . What can I do to help ?</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . You are a man after my own ‘ eart . I am going to do something to put the fear of God into the ‘ eart of that murderer . Do not pay any attention to me . Watch them . Do not look at me , do not take your eyes off them . I am looking for one of them to do something that will show us the way . It is our only chance .</stage>
   <stage>( HELEN runs in L .)</stage>
   <stage>HELEN . They 're coming .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Leave the door open so we can ‘ ear them . ( HELEN does so and returns to her mother , standing L. of ROSALIE . ) Child , kiss me for luck . ( They kiss . ) It will do no ‘ arm to kiss him , too . ( They kiss . ) Now , my boy , can you lie ?</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . Can I !</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE ( C .) . I am going into a trance . When they do come into the room you will tell them that I asked for Mr. Wales ’ glove and the minute I ‘ ave it in my hand I went off like they see me . Tell them you thought there might be some reason for it . And then leave the rest to me . ( She sits in the chair C ., facing the back of the stage . )</stage>
   <stage>WILLIAM . I understand .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . You stand here at the back of me . I wish for them all to be in front of me . ( WILLIAM crosses back of ROSALIE to R. side of ROSALIE 'S chair . HELEN crosses R. of ROSALIE above her . ) Nelly , stand close by me . ( To WILLIAM . ) Go farther back . ( HELEN moves to R. of ROSALIE . ) That 's right . Now do n't you move from there .

   <stage>ROSALIE . Mr. Wales to prevent ‘ im finding out about Spencer Lee ?</stage>
   <stage>MASON . Yes .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . And Spencer Lee ?</stage>
   <stage>MASON . He ought to have been killed . I 'd been waiting for years to kill him .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Why ?</stage>
   <stage>MASON . That 's between him and me . He smashed my life , and by God , I got him . He knows why I killed him , I told him I would . I 'm glad I did . I only wish I could have done it over and over again . That 's all .</stage>
   <stage>ROSALIE . Why did you kill Spencer Lee ?</stage>
   <stage>MASON . He took her away from me . She was the one thing in the world and he took her away from me . I went to Paris to forget and all I could do was to remember . Then she died , and I made up my mind that he must die too .</stage>
   <stage>DONOHUE . How did you get the knife in the ceiling ?</stage>
   <stage>MASON . I threw it . Just as I threw a knife into Spencer Lee 's back . I stood in the doorway of his room and told him I 'd come to kill him , and he ran for his revolver and as he ran I threw the knife into his back . Then I picked up my knife and walked away . No one saw me . I was quite safe . Quite safe until she came . And unseen hands pushed me forward . Unseen hands have pointed the way . She 's not human . Lee 's message came through her — you all heard Wales speak ; out of her lips we heard Wales ’ voice . He said he 'd come back , again and again and again . And then he came ! I saw him as he came through the door ! God Almighty , you can n't fight the dead !</stage>
