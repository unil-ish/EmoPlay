    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>A street in the city of Bethulia in Judea . Bethulia is in the hill country , overlooking the great plain of Jezreel to the south-west . Back , the gates of the city , hiding the view of the plain . Right , Judith 's house , with a tent on the roof . Left , houses . The street turns abruptly , back left , along the wall of the city . Left centre , a built-up vantage-point , from which the plain can be seen over the gates .</stage>

     <speaker>TIME</speaker>
     <p>Fifth century B. C . Towards evening . Ozias is standing alone in the street , drinking from a leathern bottle . Enter Chabris , back left .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p><stage>quickly , but with perfect calmness , hiding the bottle in his garments</stage>Old man ! It is years since I saw you . How came you past the guard , old man ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>Old ? Old ? I am not yet a hundred . Who are you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>Ozias .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>Ah ! So this is Ozias , the son of Ezbon . Before your father could walk I have nursed him on my knee ; and he was filled like the full moon — with naughtiness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>What has brought you at last out of your house ? Are you come to prophesy once more ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>I have given up prophesying .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>A profession full of risks .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>I pass my endless days in meditation and solitude .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>That sounds much safer . How comely is the wisdom of old men !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>And what do you do , sprig ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>Has none told you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>I see nobody but my daughter 's granddaughter , and her I forbid to speak to me , because being a woman she has the tongue of a woman , and a woman 's tongue is unfavourable to meditation . How should I be told ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>I am the governor of this great city of Bethulia .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>You are responsible for this city ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>I am .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>Now I understand my misfortune . And the truth was in me when I said to your mother as she lay dying : Better it is to die without children than to have them that are ungodly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>Oh ! How comely a thing is the judgment of grey hairs !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>You ask me what has brought me at last out of my house . I will tell you . Thirst ! Thirst has brought me out of my house . Every morning and every evening my great-grandchild serves me with pulse and water . For five days she has furnished less and less water , and this day — not a drop ! Can one eat pulse without water to drink ? Half an hour ago I went to her to reason with her , and she lay on her bed cracked , and raved that she herself had not drunk for three days and that there was no water left in all Bethulia . So I came at last out of my house into the streets of this city famous for its cool fountains which never fail . And lo ! I meet the governor of this city , and he is Ozias ! Ozias ! Seven days do men mourn for him that is dead , but for an ungodly man all the days of his life ! Why is there no water in Bethulia , sprig ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>Old man , meditation is good and solitude is good , but think not because you sit staring all day at your own belly that the sun and stars have ceased to revolve round the earth and the kings of this world to make war . Is it possible that you do not know what has happened ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>I only know that I cannot eat pulse without water to drink .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>Bethulia is besieged .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>Who is besieging Bethulia ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>Holofernes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>I have never heard his name . Who is he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>Never heard the name of the chief captain of Nebuchadnezzar ? Have you heard the name of Nebuchadnezzar , by chance ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>I seem to remember it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>Come up here .<stage>They go up the steps to the vantage-point .</stage>Look ! A hundred and twenty thousand foot-soldiers . Twelve thousand archers on horseback . Oxen and sheep for their provisions . Twenty thousand asses for their carriages . Camels without number . Infinite victuals ; and very much gold and silver . The like was never seen before .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p><stage>stepping down .</stage>Why has Nebuchadnezzar set about this thing ? What harm has Bethulia done to him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>Much harm . Nebuchadnezzar has decided to be God . He has decreed that all nations and tribes shall call upon him as God . And he has conquered the whole earth , excepting only Judea ; and Bethulia is the gate into Judea , and Bethulia has not listened to his decree , and I am the governor of Bethulia . So Nebuchadnezzar the great king is very angry and Holofernes is the tool of his wrath .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p><stage>going up the steps again and gazing .</stage>How many did you say ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>A hundred and twenty thousand foot and twelve thousand horse .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>At any rate this will be the last war .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>Why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>Why ! Because plainly war cannot continue on such a scale . Or if it does , mankind is destroyed . Nebuchadnezzar has rendered war ridiculous .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p><stage>laughs ; then half to himself , sarcastically</stage>What is heavier than lead , and what is the name thereof , but an aged fool ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p><stage>descending again , self-centred</stage>It remains that I cannot eat pulse without water to drink .<stage>To Ozias .</stage>And surely Bethulia has more wells than any other city of Judea .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>The wells are at the foot of the hills , and Holofernes has seized them all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>That is not fighting .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>It is war .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>No , no ! In my time soldiers fought fairly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>And killed each other . Why should Holofernes sacrifice thousands of lives to take the heights when he can reach the same result by letting his men sit still and watch ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>I say this is not war . Once I travelled many days to Nineveh . It is a city of extravagance , and when I beheld its mad , new-fangled ways , I knew that the last day was nigh . I was right . Three thousand and five hundred years since Jehovah created Adam , and Eve from his rib ... Too long ! Too long ! And what is pulse without water ? I must have water .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>It is thirty-four days since Holofernes took the wells . If you have received water up to yesterday your great-grandchild must indeed have thirsted that you might drink . I have distributed water by measure , but now the cisterns are empty , and women and young men fall down in the streets , and there is no water in Bethulia . We are all in like case , the high and the lowly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>Then give me your bottle .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>What bottle ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>I saw you put it from your lips as I came .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>It behoves you to understand , old man , that my solemn duty as governor is to maintain my own strength , for if I fell the city would fall . Without me to inspire them the populace would yield in a moment . What is the populace ? Poltroons , animals , sheep , rabbits , insects , lice !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>Give me the bottle .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>It is as empty as the cisterns .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>Give it to me , or I will cry through the streets that you are concealing water .<stage>Ozias gives him the bottle . Chabris drinks . Ozias snatches the bottle away and conceals it .</stage>Ah !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>A figure is glimpsed in the tent on the roof of Judith 's house . Ozias starts .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>What is that up yonder ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>Nothing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>Whose house is this ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>It is the house of Judith , the daughter of Merari .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>Ah ! Merari , the son of Ox , the son of Oziel — Oziel and I were little playful boys together — the son of Elcia , the son of Raphaim , the son of Eliab , the son of Nathanael , the son of ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>Old man , your memory is terrible . Have pity !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>The draught has revived me . So Merari married and had a daughter . What manner of woman is she ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>She is the widow of Manasses , who died of the heat in the barley harvest . And she is childless . And she is very rich ; for Manasses left her gold and silver and menservants and maid-servants and cattle and lands . And she has remained a widow in her house three years and four months , and never has she come forth . And there is none to give her an ill word , for she fears the Lord greatly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>Yes . But what manner of woman is she ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>She is beautiful to behold .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p><stage>to himself</stage>Oh ! That manner of woman !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>And she has fasted all the days of her widowhood , except the eves of the Sabbaths and the Sabbaths , and the eves of the new moons and the new moons , and the feasts and solemn days of the House of Israel .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>You are most deeply versed in her life . Is she exceeding beautiful ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>She is exceeding beautiful .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>Then it was she who peeped<stage>with a peculiar emphasis on the word</stage>from the tent a moment since .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>Old man , you have eyes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>It is the draught of water .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>She is said to take the air in her tent daily at this hour .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p><stage>accusingly</stage>And that is why you are here , Ozias .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>No ! I come here to reflect upon my plans for the saving of the city , and because of this vantage-point , to view the army of the Assyrians .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHABRIS</speaker>
     <p>This vantage-point is new since my day . You have built it here , not to see the Assyrians , but to see Judith . And that is why you have set a guard to keep the street empty .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>And if it be so , what then ? Old man , you are so old that to confess in your ear is sweet , like murmuring secrets into the grave . If I do come to this place to watch for the marvellous vision of Judith , what then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>No hope ? Am I then a dead body ? Am I a rotting corpse ? True , the city will be taken , and when the city is taken I may be killed . But in your meditations , old man , has it not occurred to you that death must be highly interesting ? Or I may be seized for a slave . But either I should cease speedily to be a slave , or I should become the most powerful slave in Babylon .<stage>Reflectively .</stage>We might be enslaved together .</p>

     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>Judith and I . The history of the world is full of miracles . Meanwhile , I live , and the strong savour of life inflames my nostrils ; and the ever-increasing magnificence and terror of war is like wine in my mouth . I shake with delight at the vastness and the mystery of the future .... And there is woman !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHARMIS</speaker>
     <p><stage>more confidently</stage>And I say again that you have done us a great injury , in that you have not asked peace of the Assyrians . For we have no helper , and the God of Israel has sold us into the hands of the Assyrians . We are thrown down before them with thirst and with great destruction . Therefore now we demand —<stage>looks round</stage>— I say we demand that you call the Assyrians , and deliver the whole city for a spoil to the people of Holofernes and to all his army . For it is better for us to be made a spoil than to die of thirst . We will be the slaves of Holofernes , so that our souls may live and so that we may not see the death of our infants before our eyes , nor our wives nor our children die .<stage>A mother in the group convulsively seizes her child . Pause . Ozias walks about .</stage>We take to witness against you the heaven and the earth and our God and the God of our fathers , which punishes us according to our sins and the sins of our fathers ; and we demand of you that you deliver up the city to Holofernes and his host .<stage>A silence .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Ozias ascends solemnly to the vantage-point .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p><stage>dominating the assembly</stage>Friends , it would seem that Charmis has made an end . His words are excellent and full of pity . Who follows him ? Who will speak next ? My ear waits .<stage>A silence .</stage>Ah ! Then give heed . The words of Charmis are full of pity , but I also have pity . Do not I too cherish our women , and our maidens and our young children ? And because I pity I would not yield to the monster Holofernes . Yes , the monster ! This is not war that he wages . Once our enemy strove fairly with the warriors of Israel . Now he makes our women and children to die of thirst . The magnificence of war is gone from the earth , and Holofernes by the excess of his hosts has rendered war ridiculous .<stage>Chabris raises his hands .</stage>The peoples of the earth will perceive that henceforward the institution of war cannot continue , and after this there will be no more war . But meanwhile , if I go crouching to the feet of Holofernes , what will happen and what will come to pass ? Surely it will come to pass that the monster who has sat down to watch us die of thirst will slay our little children and our old men , and dishonour our women , and ravish our innocent virgins ; for the enslaving of the conquered will not content his anger nor satisfy the lust of his great hosts . Shall these things be ? I say they shall not be . But what am I , save the servant of the citizens of Bethulia ? And what do I speak , save the thought that is in your hearts ? There is no cowardice in you . You are not sheep , nor rabbits , nor beetles , nor lice . You are valiant men , and women lion-hearted . Without you I am naught , and if I defy Holofernes , my fortitude is yours and my resolve springs from you . Charmis has invoked the holy name of the God of Israel . Let Israel not forget its God , for never has the Most High forsaken Israel . Brethren , be of good courage . Let us yet endure five days . Five short days . And if these days pass and the God of Israel turn not his mercy towards us , then will I do according to the word of Charmis . Such is my oath to you . And so it shall be .

     <p>I spoke to the people according to their understanding . Have you not said it is not meet for the people to know the thoughts of the ruler ? Hearken again ? And I will speak now to the wise woman . I flattered the people with vain praise of their courage , when they have no courage . I affrighted the people with a prophecy of terror , when there is no terror — for Holofernes is a great warrior , and has compassion in his greatness , for he is a Babylonian . I gave them hope of succour when succour is none — for , with a hundred and twenty thousand footmen and twelve thousand horse against us<stage>with dry humour</stage>to count upon the mercy of the Lord is presumption .</p>

     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>I saw the vastness of the future as in a vision . If the God of Israel perchance is merciful , and the city is saved at the eleventh hour , then it will be said in Jerusalem that there is none like Ozias of Bethulia for steadfastness , for he alone by his ardour revived the fainting populace and held firm the city ; and great will be my recompense .... But that is a dream . Always I have faced the substance of things , and the substance is that Nebuchadnezzar has decreed to rule over the whole earth , and from the east to the west there is no living man that shall not bow down before Nebuchadnezzar . Bethulia will fall . I , the governor , shall be taken captive and shown to Nebuchadnezzar , and in that day Holofernes shall say to Nebuchadnezzar : Lo ! Here is Ozias the Israelite who resisted thy mighty armies for thirty-four days and yet five days more . Use him if it seem good to thee . And I shall be lifted up to be a satrap of Nebuchadnezzar , and I shall partake of the bright glory of Nebuchadnezzar . And —<stage>hesitates .</stage></p>

     <p>Thus it happened . When the children of Israel had shut up the passages of the hill country and had fortified all the tops of the high hills , Holofernes was very angry . And he called the captains of Ammon and said to them : Tell me now , ye sons of Chanaan , who these Israelites are that dwell in the hill country , and wherein is their power and strength , and why they have determined not to come and meet me , more than all the inhabitants of the west ? And I , Achior , answered the question of Holofernes .</p>

     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>And what answer gave you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ACHIOR</speaker>
     <p>I said to Holofernes : This people is descended of the Chaldeans . But they left the way of their ancestors and would not follow the gods of their fathers ; and they worshipped the God of heaven . So they were cast out from the face of the gods of Chaldea , and they fled into Mesopotamia . And they came to Chanaan . But when a famine covered all the land of Chanaan they went down into Egypt , and the king of Egypt brought them low with labouring in brick and made them slaves . Then they cried to their God , and he smote all the land of Egypt with plagues .... And God dried the Red Sea for them .</p>

     <p>Thus . When I had finished speaking to Holofernes , all they that were about my lord and governor rose up in wrath and cried : Kill him . And the face of Holofernes darkened , and he said : And who art thou , Achior , that thou hast prophesied among us to-day that we should not make war with the people of Israel because of their God ? And who is God but Nebuchadnezzar ? Nebuchadnezzar by my hand will destroy the Israelites , and their God shall not deliver them . Their mountains shall be drunken with their blood and their fields shall be filled with their dead bodies .<stage>The citizens show alarm .</stage>And thou , Achior , shalt be delivered up to the Israelites in Bethulia , and when thou seest me again thou shalt fall among the slain ....

     <p><stage>to Ozias</stage>He is a fair youth , and has spoken truly and feared not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p><stage>with meaning</stage>Lady , he is a fair youth , and fearless . But by what sign know you that he has spoken truly ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
     <p>By the glance of his eyes I know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>It is a sign that suffices not . Shall it be said that Ozias was deceived , and shall Ozias imperil his renown , by reason of the glance of a youth when he looks at a woman — even you ?... And if he lies not , then he is a fool and his folly was great .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ACHIOR</speaker>
     <p>I spoke the truth to Holofernes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p><stage>fiercely</stage>But to speak truth did not content you . Having answered Holofernes , you must needs offer counsel to your lord and governor ! Who were you to offer counsel to the greatest of all the captains of the earth ? The protection of the mighty conqueror covered you , and lo ! in your folly did you estrange yourself from him . Fool !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ACHIOR</speaker>
     <p>I said to Holofernes , my lord and governor , that which I was appointed to say — that , no more and no less .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>And who appointed you to say that which you said ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
     <p>If there be a God in Israel , and if the Lord has not abandoned us , may not this youth be the messenger of the Most High to bring us comfort , and for a warning to the vainglory of Holofernes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p><stage>with irony</stage>All is possible to the Lord . Yet may his purposes be hidden from us .<stage>To the soldiers .</stage>Until the Lord vouchsafe new wisdom to me , his servant , bind fetters about the feet of Achior , and take him to the house of bondage , and set a guard over him , for a spy is not more dangerous than a fool .</p>

     <p><stage>quietly</stage>Shame him not with fetters , lord Ozias .</p>

    </sp>
    <stage>At a sign from Judith , Haggith re-enters the house .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>Your face is turned from me , because of the youth . Yet you came out to see the governor of the city , and the governor could do no other than I have done .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
     <p><stage>looking at him</stage>Ozias , you have shown me your heart .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>Yea !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
     <p>And in the moment when the youth came you asked of me my counsel .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>Yea !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
     <p>Hear me now , for the words you have spoken before the people this day are not right .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>What words ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
     <p>This promise that you have uttered to deliver the city to our enemies , unless within five days the Lord turn to help . Who are you that seek to stand instead of God among the children of men ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>Stand instead of God !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
     <p>Who are you that have tempted God this day ? For you cannot find the depth of the heart of man ,— how then shall you search out God or comprehend his purpose ? Brother , provoke not the Lord our God to anger . For if he will not help us within these five days , he has power to defend us when he will , even every day . Do not bind the counsels of God . For God is not as man that he may be threatened , neither as the son of man that he should be wavering . Therefore let us wait for salvation from him , and he will hear our voice ,— if it please him . Moreover , this city is the key and the gateway to all Judea . If it be obstinate in resistance , Judea is not defiled , but if it be taken the whole land shall lie waste and God will require the profanation of it at our mouth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>All that you have spoken is truth , and there is none to gainsay your words . From the beginning of your days we have known your wisdom , and your understanding is manifest ....<stage>With significance .</stage>But we are thirsty .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
     <p>If we are thirsty , let us give thanks to the Lord our God , who tries us , even as he did our fathers .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>The people in the extremity of their thirst compelled me to an oath , which I will not break .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
     <p>Say you the people , Ozias ? As for them , you hold them lightly , and they are as naught in your eyes . So much you have avowed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p><stage>in a new tone</stage>It is true . This day I hold the people lightly . But when the great madness and desperation of thirst comes at last upon them , who shall hold them ? In that day they will seize the things forbidden , and they will drink the wine sanctified and reserved for the priests that serve the Lord . And to avert from me the wrath of Joachim , the high priest of Jerusalem , I have sent already a messenger to Jerusalem to bring a licence that this matter may be lawful .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
     <p><stage>shocked</stage>Nay !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>I say it will be so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
     <p>It shall not be so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>Then pray you to the Most High for the city , even for all of us , and the Lord will send rain for our cisterns and we shall faint no more . Pray , for you are a godly woman , and the God of Israel shall listen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
     <p><stage>with supreme impressiveness</stage>Hear me again , Ozias . This night I will do a thing which shall go throughout all the generations to the children of Israel . You shall stand this night in the gate of the city , and I will go forth from the city with my waiting-woman ; and within the days that you have promised to deliver the city to our enemies the Lord will visit Israel by my hand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>On what errand will you go ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
     <p>Enquire not of my act , for I will not declare it until the things are finished that I do . But this I declare , that the Lord has inclined himself to me , and now he has sent Achior for a sign .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>You go to Holofernes !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
     <p>To Holofernes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>Do not go !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
     <p>But why shall I not go ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p>The perils of the heathen will surround you , and harm will surely befall you , for Holofernes will work lamentable evil upon you . And I cannot suffer it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
     <p><stage>smiling</stage>Did not Ozias say that Holofernes was a great warrior and had compassion in his greatness ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p><stage>insistent</stage>I cannot suffer it , for if any shame come upon you I will not live .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
     <p>God will not see his handmaid shamed . Moreover I regard not myself in this thing , but the welfare of the people of Israel .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
     <p><stage>kneeling</stage>Judith , I entreat you ! For you are the light of my eyes , and without you the world is not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
     <p><stage>softly</stage>I know it . Think you that in these years I have not seen the depths of your heart , Ozias ? Think you that I was blind in my tent ? Think you that I watched not upon you ? You were comely in my sight . But this day you have revealed your pride . For you seek not God , but the vanity of the earth , and you would make all Israel the instrument of your glory , denying the Lord . And I am sad .</p>
    </sp>

For thy power standeth not in multitude , nor thy might in strong men . Smite the Assyrians by the deceit of my lips ; break down their stateliness by the hand of a woman . And make my speech and deceit to be their wound and stripe , who have purposed cruel things against thy covenant and against the top of Zion . And make every nation and tribe to acknowledge that thou art the God of all power , and that there is none other that protecteth the people of Israel but thou .<stage>She rises . The crowd murmurs : ‘ Amen . ’ All rise . Judith comes down from the vantage-point . Silence .</stage></p>

      <p>Nebuchadnezzar is your god ? Is it not so , Bagoas ?</p>

      <speaker>BAGOAS</speaker>
      <p>Nebuchadnezzar is henceforward the god of the Assyrians and of all the lands which their spears conquer . It is an official order .</p>

      <p>If Nebuchadnezzar laid a command upon you , would you disregard it ?</p>

      <p>I would not , for my skin is very valuable to me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
      <p>As Nebuchadnezzar is your god , so is the Lord of Israel mine . And my God laid a secret command upon me to speak with Prince Holofernes alone and with none other in his tent . Thus , and thus only , was it that I refused to speak in the presence even of the mighty Bagoas . But as I withstood you in the valley there , the God of Israel descended upon me and I heard the voice of God in my ear , and the voice said : ‘ It is permitted to thee to speak with Bagoas also . ’ Therefore I yielded to the importunity of Prince Holofernes and of Bagoas .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BAGOAS</speaker>
      <p>Your god is a wise god and has discernment .</p>

      <p>This I tell you , that there may be peace and good intelligence between us . Is there peace between us ?</p>

      <p>And what sayest thou of Achior ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
      <p>O lord and governor , I say : Reject not the word of Achior , but lay it up in your heart .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
      <p>Thou art bold .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
      <p>The word of Achior is true . For the Israelites shall not be punished , and the sword shall not prevail against them , except they sin against their God .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
      <p>Not even my sword ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
      <p>Not even the sword of my lord and governor , except they sin against their God .<stage>With significance .</stage>But they will sin .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
      <p>Ah ! They will sin ? In what will they sin ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
      <p>Death is fallen upon them , and they will provoke their God to anger , for their water is scant , and they faint in their thirst ; and they will drink the holy wine which was sanctified and reserved for the priests who serve before the face of our God : which thing is not lawful for any of the people so much as to touch with their hands .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
      <p><stage>with fire</stage>And when the city has fallen while the Assyrians sit and watch , and when all men whisper one to another that the greatest captain of the earth conquered by a device because he dared not attack boldly with spear , and bow , and sling — in that day will my lord and governor be content ?

And when the time comes I will go into the valley , and I will pray to God , and mayhap He will tell me when the Israelites in Bethulia have committed their sin . And I will come and show it to you , and thereupon my lord and governor shall go forth with all his army , and none shall resist him .</p>

I will lead my lord and governor in the midst of Judea , until he comes to Jerusalem ; and I will set his throne in the midst of Jerusalem , and a dog shall not so much as open his mouth at my lord and prince . For these things were declared unto me from on high , and I am sent to tell them .</p>

At Bethulia , being busied all my days with the ordering of your possessions , I had no time for traffic with men ; neither desire . And I deemed them terrible and masterful creatures . And when you commanded me to go forth into the camps and delude and entangle with wiles whatever Assyrian I should meet , I was afraid . For it was in my heart that I could not accomplish this thing . Yet I have done it prettily . And it is easier to me far than sweeping with a besom . Either all men are simpletons and besotted with self-conceit , or Ingur exceeds greatly in folly .

      <p>Bagoas , with thine arts thou shalt persuade the Hebrew woman to come to us and to eat and drink with us this night .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BAGOAS</speaker>
      <p><stage>grimly</stage>Persuasion shall be used , highness . My arts are many and various .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
      <p>It will be a shame for our person if we let such a woman go , not having delighted in her company . If we do not draw her to us she will laugh us to scorn .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BAGOAS</speaker>
      <p>Yea , highness . But my lord has but this moment appointed a great feast with his captains at sunset . How then shall he eat and drink with the lady Judith ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
      <p>Thick-skull ! Speak not to me of my captains ! The Council of the Captains was as dust in my mouth , and I could not away with it . Therefore I sharply dismissed the Council , and soothed their damnable pride with the promise of a mighty feast . But what care I for the captains ? My heart thirsts horribly for this Hebrew woman , and I am full of a great madness .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BAGOAS</speaker>
      <p>So be it , highness . Nevertheless , the Prince has promised to his captains a mighty feast , and the word of Holofernes is a rock that cannot be shaken .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
      <p>Oh ! What a calamity is love ! And there is no slave so trodden down as him that is the slave of desire .... Bah ! I will eat and drink quickly with the captains , and the woman shall await me here .</p>

      <p>Didst thou demand of him that he should tell thee if the Israelites in Bethulia had committed their sin , and if the time of my triumph was at hand ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
      <p>No , lord . I prayed for the forgiveness of the transgressions of thy handmaid .</p>

      <p>My mistress is hidden in a sure place in the valley , for there is one among the Assyrians who fears not God .

     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
      <p>What licence ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MESSENGER</speaker>
      <p>The licence for the people of Bethulia to drink the wine which is sanctified and reserved to the priests which serve the Lord .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
      <p><stage>affecting to be puzzled</stage>Who hath demanded this licence from Joachim ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MESSENGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>surprised</stage>The lord Ozias sent a messenger to Jerusalem to beseech that the licence should be granted . And my lord 's messenger travelled so swiftly that in the moment when he reached the temple at Jerusalem he fell sick and vomited , and I have come to Bethulia in his place , for after he had vomited he unfolded to me the secret way into the city .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
      <p><stage>grandly</stage>It is true . In the heavy multitude of my cares I had forgotten this matter of the licence .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MESSENGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>confidentially</stage>And Joachim hath bidden me to say privily that if any have already in their extremity drunk of the sanctified wine it shall be denied utterly — for the sake of the church .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
      <p>Ah !</p>

      <p>And here is the licence .<stage>Offering it .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
      <p>Friend , keep the licence and render it back to Joachim , the high priest in Jerusalem . For I need it not , and I demanded it only by excess of prudence such as becomes the governor of a city besieged and thirsting . But we Bethulians are a faithful and a constant people , and we have trusted in the Most High . And if perchance any have drunk of the sanctified wine unknown to me<stage>with a grimace</stage>— it shall be denied utterly , for the sake of seemliness .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MESSENGER</speaker>
      <p>But in the days of trial to come , will not the lord Ozias have need of the licence ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
      <p><stage>grandly</stage>Friend , return ye to Joachim and say to him that the Lord has delivered Bethulia from the Assyrians by the subtlety of his servant Ozias .</p>

      <speaker>MESSENGER</speaker>
      <p><stage>amazed</stage>What says my lord ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
      <p>Yea , this night the head of Holofernes is set on a spear in the square before the temple , and the Assyrians flee one from another in disorder , and my hosts are about to descend upon them and rend them to pieces where they stand foolishly in the valley .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MESSENGER</speaker>
      <p>But this thing is marvellous beyond the understanding of man !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
      <p>It is indeed marvellous .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MESSENGER</speaker>
      <p>And when Joachim enquires of me who hath taken Holofernes the great captain to behead him , and by what device , what shall I answer to Joachim ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
      <p>You will answer that Ozias , knowing the weakness of Holofernes , sent down to him secretly a woman , a certain Judith of Bethulia , and upon the counsel of Ozias the woman by wiles compassed the death of Holofernes as I have told you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MESSENGER</speaker>
      <p>It is a tale which fathers shall tell to their children , and to their children 's children , and men shall wonder thereat for all time . And now your servant will say to you a thing which has not been told to him but which his ear has heard . It was said among the mighty that if my lord Ozias should save Judea from the heathen , he would receive notable advancement and be raised up among the great ones of the land .<stage>Ozias bows .</stage>Yet will Joachim not be astonished , for it was spoken in Jerusalem that among all the Israelites there is none like the lord Ozias for cunning and obstinacy in defence .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
      <p><stage>nettled</stage>Nevertheless it is meet that Joachim should be astonished , for with five thousand have I set at naught one hundred and two and thirty thousand , and in the chronicles of Israel there is written down no deed to match the delivery of Judea from the Assyrians .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MESSENGER</speaker>
      <p>The God of Israel hath saved Israel .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>

      <p>Holofernes came out of the mountains from the north , and his horsemen covered the hills ; and he bragged that he would burn up the borders of Israel , and kill her young men with the sword , and make the virgins as a spoil . But the Almighty Lord hath disappointed the Assyrians by the hand of a woman ; and my sandals ravished the eye of Holofernes , and my beauty took his mind prisoner , and the knife passed through his neck . Let all creatures serve the Lord !</p>

      <p>Shall we not go into your house , you and I ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
      <p>My house is not ready to receive you , Ozias .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
      <p>Let it be so . But before Achior I will not speak .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
      <p>Achior , go into my house , and do honour to my dwelling , and repose in it .</p>

      <p>Gladly , O lady !<stage>Exit into the house .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
      <p>What is the urgency that oppresses you , Ozias , and why are you troubled in the hour of triumph ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
      <p><stage>losing control of himself</stage>Who is the heathen Achior that you should prefer him and make your mouth sweet to him ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
      <p>Leave Achior , and let us come at once to the matter that presses .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
      <p>Oh ! I will not speak smoothly for a pretence ! Thou knowest that my jealousy smokes against Achior . Yea , and against Holofernes also .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
      <p>But Holofernes is dead .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
      <p>Before he went down to his place , didst thou not sin with him ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
      <p>As the Lord liveth , my countenance deceived him to his destruction , yet did he not shame me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
      <p>Blessed be our God !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
      <p>But how does this matter touch thee , and what is my virtue in thy regard ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
      <p>Let Holofernes suffice thee , and drive not me also to death with the softness of thy voice . Art thou not aware that the soul of my soul burns for thee and will not wait — the more so since thou hast done a mighty deed and art proved a woman beyond all women ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
      <p>Nay ! I have done naught ; but the Lord hath saved Israel by thy hand .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
      <p>What is this humbleness ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
      <p>AS I came towards the city with Achior , the messenger from Jerusalem met us in the way , and he was full to bursting of the word of Ozias , and that Ozias had delivered Israel , and that what I did I did by thy device and at thy command . But the messenger in speaking knew not that he spoke to Judith , and I let him go .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
      <p>Judith ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
      <p>Yet it seems to me that thou wast ignorant of all that which I went out to do , and my plan was hidden from thee .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
      <p><stage>powerfully persuasive</stage>Hearken to me , Judith . I swear it was for thee that I boasted . My aim was that thy mighty deed should gain preferment in Jerusalem . But thou art a woman and therefore preferment is not for thee . Yet now by reason of my boasting I shall be greatly advanced and lifted up , and in all Judea there will be none higher than me , and thus wilt thou also be advanced and lifted up .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
      <p>I desire no preferment .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
      <p>But I would have it in thy behalf ; and my appetite is double . I rage for glory and dominion , and I rage also for thee . And I will offer thee glory and dominion , for I seek these things as a gift to thy beauty . And if I cannot lay them on thy lap my heel shall spurn mankind and I will tread it to dust . My desires are terrible ; they will not be withstood ; they consume me daily , but daily I am renewed . I am on fire , but by the fierceness of the fire I am strengthened . I was conceived for greatness and my mother bore me for mastery , and the huge earth shall shake with the terror of my commands .... And I am held between thy fingers .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
      <p>I deny not thy greatness .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
      <p>Surely thou canst not . For thou too art great . And my greatness yearns to thine .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
      <p>Wilt thou listen ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
      <p>I hear .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
      <p>With this greatness of thine goes deceit and laxity of mind .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
      <p>Yet when thou didst thy mighty deed didst thou not deceive cruelly ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
      <p>I deceived not for myself , but for Israel ; and my guile was for the glory of God . But thy heart is set only upon advancement and power , which is corruption .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
      <p>Judith , canst thou not lift thy thoughts beyond good and evil , and canst thou not contemplate the marvellous greatness of man ? I will abase myself before none but thee , and in my ear there is no commandment but thine ; and all other decrees will I mock . I would have thee in marriage , and I would have no other but thee . Wilt thou take me to thee , and wilt thou yield thyself without fear to the terrible flame of my love ? For thus shalt thou fulfil thyself and me . But give heed before thou answerest , and know that if thou turnest from me , I will make all the nations of the earth to tremble with my fury .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
      <p>Thou art great also in thy loving .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
      <p>Once thou didst love me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
      <p>Nay ! I but looked upon thee in kindness . But now I will not go to thee in marriage .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
      <p><stage>half admiring</stage>Thou art not then afraid of my wrath !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
      <p>I am Judith .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a fresh access of violence</stage>Thou hungerest for Achior . Wouldst thou marry a heathen , thou a Hebrew woman ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
      <p>And thou , if I had not accomplished the will of the Lord , and if thou hadst been carried to Babylon as thou saidst , wouldst thou not have denied the Most High and gone after other gods ? But Achior believeth in our God , and this day will be joined into the house of Israel .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
      <p><stage>savagely scornful</stage>What is Achior but a simpleton !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
      <p>It may be . But I love him and he shall rule me ... for he came hither for a sign from the Lord .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
      <p><stage>savagely resentful</stage>Oh ! If I did not love thee , would I not undo thee !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
      <p>Thou ! Thou art Ozias , but I am she who cut off the head of a mightier than thou , even Holofernes in his tent . Go thy ways and fulfil greatness . As for me I will remain obediently in my house , and truth and righteousness shall reign in my house .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>The procession returns , the women bearing the banners of the Assyrians . Achior enters from the house .</stage>
     <stage>Judith is crowned with olives .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
      <p>And now let the priests and the elders enter with me into my house , and Achior shall follow them , so that he may be received into Israel , and I will be betrothed to him with all the ceremonies of the law , for he came to me as a messenger from God . And when the marriage has been performed , I will submit myself to him as a wife to her husband .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HAGGITH</speaker>
      <p>And let Ingur also be received into Israel , for he has repented of his idolatries . And he shall be my husband , yet shall he not rule me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>OZIAS</speaker>
      <p>Brethren , hearken ! This night I go to Jerusalem , for I am called to higher things , because I have delivered Israel . And I shall not return to this little city ; but ye will have tidings of me in the years to come , and ye will say proudly to the strangers within your gates : He was a Bethulian and once he ruled over us .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JUDITH</speaker>
      <p>The lord Ozias is called to greatness . Peace go with him .</p>
