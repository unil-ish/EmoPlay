NOTE Both these plays have been written for Mr. Fay 's “ Irish National Theatre . ” “ The King 's Threshold ” was played in October ,<date>1903</date>, and “ On Baile 's Strand ” will be played in February or March ,<date>1904</date>. Both are founded on Old Irish Prose Romances , but I have borrowed some ideas for the arrangement of my subject in “ The King 's Threshold ” from “ Sancan the Bard , ” a play published by Mr. Edwin Ellis some ten years ago .</docImprint>

     <role>Footnote 1 : Written for the first production of “ The King 's</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Threshold ” in Dublin , but not used , as , owing to the smallness</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>of the company</role>
     <roleDesc>nobody could be spared to speak it</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>An OLD MAN with a red dressing-gown</role>
     <roleDesc>red slippers and red</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>nightcap</role>
     <roleDesc>holding a brass candlestick with a guttering candle in it</roleDesc>

     <role>comes on from side of stage and goes in front of the dull green</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>curtain .</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Old Man . I 've got to speak the prologue . [ He shuffles on a few</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>steps . ] My nephew , who is one of the play actors , came to me , and I in</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>my bed , and my prayers said , and the candle put out , and he told me</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>there were so many characters in this new play</role>
     <roleDesc>that all the company</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>were in it</role>
     <roleDesc>whether they had been long or short at the business , and</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>that there was n't one left to speak the prologue . Wait a bit</role>
     <roleDesc>there 's a</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>draught here . [ He pulls the curtain closer together . ] That 's better</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>And that 's why I 'm here</role>
     <roleDesc>and maybe I 'm a fool for my pains</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>And my nephew said</role>
     <roleDesc>there are a good many plays to be played for you</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>some to-night and some on other nights through the winter</role>
     <roleDesc>and the most</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>of them are simple enough</role>
     <roleDesc>and tell out their story to the end . But as</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>to the big play you are to see to-night</role>
     <roleDesc>my nephew taught me to say what</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>the poet had taught him to say about it . [ Puts down candlestick and</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>puts right finger on left thumb . ] First</role>
     <roleDesc>he who told the story of</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Seanchan on King Guaire 's threshold long ago in the old books told it</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>wrongly , for he was a friend of the king , or maybe afraid of the king</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>and so he put the king in the right . But he that tells the story now</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>being a poet</role>
     <roleDesc>has put the poet in the right</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>And then [ touches other finger ] I am to say : Some think it would be a</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>finer tale if Seanchan had died at the end of it</role>
     <roleDesc>and the king had the</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>guilt at his door</role>
     <roleDesc>for that might have served the poet 's cause better in</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>the end . But that is not true</role>
     <roleDesc>for if he that is in the story but a</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>shadow and an image of poetry had not risen up from the death that</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>threatened him</role>
     <roleDesc>the ending would not have been true and joyful enough to</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>be put into the voices of players and proclaimed in the mouths of</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>trumpets</role>
     <roleDesc>and poetry would have been badly served</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>[ He takes up the candlestick again .</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>And as to what happened Seanchan after</role>
     <roleDesc>my nephew told me he did n't</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>know</role>
     <roleDesc>and the poet did n't know , and it 's likely there 's nobody that</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>knows . But my nephew thinks he never sat down at the king 's table again</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>after the way he had been treated</role>
     <roleDesc>but that he went to some quiet green</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>place in the hills with Fedelm</role>
     <roleDesc>his sweetheart , where the poor people</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>made much of him because he was wise</role>
     <roleDesc>and where he made songs and</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>poems</role>
     <roleDesc>and it 's likely enough he made some of the old songs and the old</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>poems the poor people on the hillsides are saying and singing to-day</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>[ A trumpet-blast .</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>Well</role>
     <roleDesc>it 's time for me to be going . That trumpet means that the curtain</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>is going to rise</role>
     <roleDesc>and after a while the stage there will be filled up</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>with great ladies and great gentlemen</role>
     <roleDesc>and poets , and a king with a</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>crown on him</role>
     <roleDesc>and all of them as high up in themselves with the pride of</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>their youth and their strength and their fine clothes as if there was no</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>such thing in the world as cold in the shoulders</role>
     <roleDesc>and speckled shins</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>and the pains in the bones and the stiffness in the joints that make an</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>old man that has the whole load of the world on him ready for his bed</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>[ He begins to shuffle away</role>
     <roleDesc>and then stops</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>And it would be better for me</role>
     <roleDesc>that nephew of mine to be thinking less</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>of his play-acting</role>
     <roleDesc>and to have remembered to boil down the knap-weed</roleDesc>

    <lg>
     <l>I welcome you that have the mastery</l>
     <l>Of the two kinds of music ; the one kind</l>
     <l>Being like a woman , the other like a man ;</l>
     <l>Both you that understand stringed instruments ,</l>
     <l>And how to mingle words and notes together</l>
     <l>So artfully , that all the art is but speech</l>
     <l>Delighted with its own music ; and you that carry</l>
     <l>The long twisted horn and understand</l>
     <l>The heady notes that being without words</l>
     <l>Can hurry beyond time and fate and change ;</l>
     <l>For the high angels that drive the horse of time ,</l>
     <l>The golden one by day , by night the silver ,</l>
     <l>Are not more welcome to one that loves the world</l>
     <l>For some fair woman 's sake .</l>
     <l>I have called you hither</l>
     <l>To save the life of your great master , Seanchan ,</l>
     <l>For all day long it has flamed up or flickered</l>
     <l>To the fast-cooling hearth .</l>

    <speaker>Senias</speaker>
    <p>When did he sicken ? Is it a fever that is wasting him ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>King</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>He did not sicken , but three days ago</l>
     <l>He said he would not eat , and lay down there</l>
     <l>And has not eaten since . Till yesterday</l>
     <l>I thought that hunger and weakness had been enough ,</l>
     <l>But finding them too trifling and too light</l>
     <l>To hold his mouth from biting at the grave</l>
     <l>I called you hither , and have called others yet .</l>
     <l>The girl he is to wed at harvest-time ,</l>
     <l>That should be of all living the most dear ,</l>
     <l>Is coming from the South , and had I known</l>
     <l>Of any other neighbours or good friends</l>
     <l>That might persuade him , I had brought them hither ,</l>
     <l>Even though I 'd to ransack the world for them .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Senias</speaker>
    <p>What was it put him to this work , High King ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>King</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>You will call it no great matter . Three days ago</l>
     <l>I yielded to the outcry of my courtiers ,</l>
     <l>Bishops , soldiers , and makers of the law ,</l>
     <l>Who long had thought it against their dignity</l>
     <l>For a mere man of words to sit among them</l>
     <l>At my own table ; and when the meal was spread</l>
     <l>I ordered Seanchan to good company ,</l>
     <l>But to a lower table ; and when he pleaded</l>
     <l>The poet 's right , established when the world</l>
     <l>Was first established , I said that I was King</l>
     <l>And made and unmade rights at my own pleasure .</l>
     <l>And that it was the men who ruled the world ,</l>
     <l>And not the men who sang to it , who should sit</l>
     <l>Where there was the most honour . My courtiers ,</l>
     <l>Bishops , soldiers , and makers of the law</l>
     <l>Shouted approval , and amid that noise</l>
     <l>Seanchan went out , and from that hour to this ,</l>
     <l>Although there is good food and drink beside him ,</l>
     <l>Has eaten nothing . If a man is wronged ,</l>
     <l>Or thinks that he is wronged , and will lie down</l>
     <l>Upon another 's threshold until he dies ,</l>
     <l>The common people for all time to come</l>
     <l>Will raise a heavy cry against that threshold ,</l>
     <l>Even though it is the King 's . He lies there now</l>
     <l>Perishing ; he is calling against my majesty ,</l>
     <l>That old custom that has no meaning in it ,</l>
     <l>And as he perishes , my name in the world</l>
     <l>Is perishing also . I cannot give way</l>
     <l>Because I am King , because if I give way</l>
     <l>My nobles would call me a weakling , and it may be</l>
     <l>The very throne be shaken ; but should you</l>
     <l>That are his friends speak to him and persuade him</l>
     <l>To turn his mouth from the ill-savouring grave</l>
     <l>And eat good food , he shall not lack my favour ;</l>
     <l>For I will give plough-land and grazing-land ,</l>
     <l>Or all but anything he has set his heart on .</l>
     <l>It is not all because of my good name</l>
     <l>I 'd have him live , for I have found him a man</l>
     <l>That might well hit the fancy of a king</l>
     <l>Banished out of his country , or a woman 's ,</l>
     <l>Or any other 's that can judge a man</l>
     <l>For what he is . But I that sit a throne ,</l>
     <l>And take my measure from the needs of the state ,</l>
     <l>Call his wild thought that over-runs the measure ,</l>
     <l>Making words more than deeds , and his proud will</l>
     <l>That would unsettle all , most mischievous ,</l>
     <l>And he himself a most mischievous man .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Senias</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>King , whether you did right or wrong in this</l>
     <l>Let the King say , for all that I need say</l>
     <l>Is that there 's nothing that cries out for death</l>
     <l>In the withholding of that ancient right ,</l>
     <l>And that I will persuade him . Your own words</l>
     <l>Had been enough persuasion were it not</l>
     <l>That he is lost in dreams that hunger makes ,</l>
     <l>And therefore heedless , or lost in heedless sleep .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>King</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>I leave him to your love , that it may promise</l>
     <l>Plough-lands and grass-lands , jewels and silken wear ,</l>
     <l>Or anything but that old right of the poets .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <stage>He goes out . The PUPILS , who have been standing perfectly quiet , all turn towards SEANCHAN , and move a step nearer .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Senias</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>The King did wrong to abrogate our right ,</l>
     <l>But Seanchan , who talks of dying for it ,</l>
     <l>Talks foolishly . Look at us , Seanchan ,</l>
     <l>Waken out of your dream and look at us ,</l>
     <l>Who have ridden under the moon and all the day ,</l>
     <l>Until the moon has all but come again ,</l>
     <l>That we might be beside you .</l>

   <stage>SEANCHAN turns half round leaning on his elbow , and speaks as if in a dream .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Seanchan</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>I was but now</l>
     <l>At Almhuin , in a great high-raftered house ,</l>
     <l>With Finn and Osgar . Odours of roast flesh</l>
     <l>Rose round me and I saw the roasting spits ,</l>
     <l>And then the dream was broken , and I saw</l>
     <l>Grania dividing salmon by a pool ,</l>
     <l>And then I was awakened by your voice .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Senias</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>It is your hunger that makes you dream of flesh</l>
     <l>Roasting , and for your hunger I could weep ;</l>
     <l>And yet the hunger of the crane that starves</l>
     <l>Because the moonlight glittering on the pool</l>
     <l>And flinging a pale shadow has made it shy ,</l>
     <l>Seems to me little more fantastical</l>
     <l>Than this that 's blown into so great a trouble .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Seanchan</speaker>
    <lg>
     <stage>Who has turned away again .</stage>
     <l>There is much truth in that , for all things change</l>
     <l>At times , as if the moonlight altered them ,</l>
     <l>And my mind alters as if it were the crane 's ;</l>
     <l>For when the heavy body has grown weak</l>
     <l>There 's nothing that can tether the wild mind</l>
     <l>That being moonstruck and fantastical</l>
     <l>Goes where it fancies . I had even thought</l>
     <l>I knew your voice and face , but now the words</l>
     <l>Are so unlikely that I needs must ask</l>
     <l>Who is it that bids me put my hunger by ?</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Senias</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>I am your oldest pupil , Seanchan ;</l>
     <l>The one that has been with you many years ,</l>
     <l>So many that you said at Candlemas</l>
     <l>That I had almost done with school , and knew</l>
     <l>All but all that poets understand .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Seanchan</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>My oldest pupil . No , that cannot be ;</l>
     <l>For it is someone of the courtly crowds</l>
     <l>That have been round about me from sunrise</l>
     <l>And I am tricked by dreams , but I 'll refute them .</l>
     <l>I asked the pupil that I loved the best ,</l>
     <l>At Candlemas , why poetry is honoured ,</l>
     <l>Wishing to know how he 'd defend our craft</l>
     <l>In distant lands among strange churlish Kings .</l>
     <l>And he 'd an answer .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Senias</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>I said the poets hung</l>
     <l>Images of the life that was in Eden</l>
     <l>About the childbed of the world , that it ,</l>
     <l>Looking upon those images , might bear</l>
     <l>Triumphant children ; but why must I stand here</l>
     <l>Repeating an old lesson while you starve ?</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Seanchan</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Tell on , for I begin to know the voice ;</l>
     <l>What evil thing will come upon the world</l>
     <l>If the arts perish ?</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Senias</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>If the arts should perish</l>
     <l>The world that lacked them would be like a woman</l>
     <l>That looking on the cloven lips of a hare</l>
     <l>Brings forth a hare-lipped child .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Seanchan</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>But that 's not all .</l>
     <l>For when I asked you how a man should guard</l>
     <l>Those images you had an answer also ,</l>
     <l>If you 're the man that you have claimed to be ,</l>
     <l>Comparing them to venerable things</l>
     <l>God gave to men before he gave them wheat .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Senias</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>I answered , and the word was half your own ,</l>
     <l>That he should guard them , as the men of Dea</l>
     <l>Guard their four treasures , as the Grail King guards</l>
     <l>His holy cup , or the pale righteous horse</l>
     <l>The jewel that is underneath his horn ,</l>
     <l>Pouring out life for it , as one pours out</l>
     <l>Sweet heady wine — but now I understand</l>
     <l>You would refute me out of my own mouth ;</l>
     <l>And yet a place at table near the King</l>
     <l>Is nothing of great moment , Seanchan .</l>
     <l>How does so light a thing touch poetry ?</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <stage>SEANCHAN is now sitting up . He still looks dreamily in front of him .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Seanchan</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>At Candlemas you called this poetry</l>
     <l>One of the fragile mighty things of God</l>
     <l>That die at an insult .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Senias</speaker>
    <lg>
     <stage>To other PUPILS .</stage>
     <l>Give me some true answer .</l>
     <l>For on that day we spoke about the court</l>
     <l>And said that all that was insulted there</l>
     <l>The world insulted , for the courtly life ,</l>
     <l>Being the first comely child of the world ,</l>
     <l>Is the world 's model . How shall I answer him ?</l>
     <l>Can you not give me some true argument ?</l>
     <l>I will not tempt him with a lying one .</l>

     <l>Why did you take me from my father 's fields ?</l>
     <l>If you would leave me now , what shall I love ?</l>
     <l>Where shall I go , what shall I set my hand to ?</l>
     <l>And why have you put music in my ears</l>
     <l>If you would send me to the clattering houses ?</l>
     <l>I will throw down the trumpet and the harp ,</l>
     <l>For how could I sing verses or make music</l>
     <l>With none to praise me and a broken heart ?</l>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Seanchan</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>What was it that the poets promised you</l>
     <l>If it was not their sorrow ? Do not speak .</l>
     <l>Have I not opened school on these bare steps ,</l>
     <l>And are not you the youngest of my scholars ?</l>
     <l>And I would have all know that when all falls</l>
     <l>In ruin , poetry calls out in joy ,</l>
     <l>Being the scattering hand , the bursting pod ,</l>
     <l>The victim 's joy among the holy flame ,</l>
     <l>God 's laughter at the shattering of the world ,</l>
     <l>And now that joy laughs out and weeps and burns</l>
     <l>On these bare steps .</l>

   <stage>Three men come in . CIAN and BRIAN , old men carrying basket with food , and MAYOR OF KINVARA . They stand at the side listening .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Senias</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Trouble him with no useless argument .</l>
     <l>Be silent ; there is nothing we can do</l>
     <l>Except find out the King and kneel to him</l>
     <l>And beg our ancient right . These three have come</l>
     <l>To say whatever we could say and more ,</l>
     <l>And fare as badly . Come , boy , that 's no use ;</l>
<stage>He lifts the BOY up .</stage>     <l>If it seem well that we beseech the King ,</l>
     <l>Lay down your harps and trumpets on the stones</l>
     <l>In silence and come with me silently .</l>
     <l>Come with slow footfalls and bow all your heads ,</l>
     <l>For a bowed head becomes a mourner best .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <stage>They lay the harps and trumpets down one by one and then go out very solemnly and slowly , following one another .</stage>

     <l>No ,</l>

     <l>Besides , there is no reason why he 'd eat</l>
     <l>Till he has heard my reasons .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cian</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>It were better</l>
     <l>To show what we have brought him in the basket ,</l>
     <l>For we have nothing that he has not liked</l>
     <l>From boyhood .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Brian</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>For we have not brought kings ’ food</l>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mayor</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>You are not showing right respect to me ,</l>

    </lg>
   </sp>

    <speaker>Cian</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>He must be famishing , he looks so pale .</l>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Mayor</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>No , no ; I lost a word at every cross road</l>

     <l>I 'll have forgot it .</l>

    <p>Why , what 's this foolery ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mayor</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>No foolery ;</l>
     <l>A message from the richest , best born townsman</l>
     <l>Of your own town , and from your aged father .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cian</speaker>
    <p>Run through it while I am getting out the food .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mayor</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>How was I to begin ? What was the word</l>
     <l>That was to keep it in my memory ?</l>
     <l>Wait , I have notched it on this Ogham stick .</l>
     <l>“ Chief poet , ” “ Ireland , ” “ Townsman ” ; that is it .</l>
     <l>Chief poet of Ireland , when we heard that trouble</l>
     <l>Had come between you and the King of Ireland</l>
     <l>It plunged us in deep sorrow , part for you ,</l>
     <l>Our honoured townsman , part for our good town .</l>
     <l>The King was said to be most friendly to us ,</l>
     <l>And we had reasons , as you 'll recollect ,</l>
     <l>For thinking that he was about to give</l>
     <l>Those grazing lands inland we so much need ,</l>
     <l>Being pinched between the water and the rocks .</l>
     <l>But now his friendliness being ill repaid</l>
     <l>Will be turned from us and our town get nothing .</l>
     <l>But there was something else — I 'll find the word</l>
     <l>That was to keep it in my memory .</l>
     <l>“ Pride ” — that 's the word ,— we would not have you think ,</l>
     <l>Weighty as these considerations are ,</l>
     <l>That they have been as weighty in our minds</l>
     <l>As our desire that one we take much pride in ,</l>
     <l>A man who has been an honour to our town ,</l>
     <l>Should live and prosper , therefore we beseech you</l>
     <l>To give way in a matter of no moment ,</l>
     <l>A matter of mere sentiment , a trifle ,</l>
     <l>That we may always keep our pride in you .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Seanchan</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Their pride , their pride , what do they know of pride ?</l>
     <l>My pupils do not know it , for they beg</l>
     <l>From the King 's favour what is theirs by right ,</l>
     <l>And how can men , that God has made so weak</l>
     <l>They need a rich man 's favour every day ,</l>
     <l>Know anything of pride ?</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cian</speaker>
    <p><stage>To MAYOR .</stage>You have spoken it wrongly . You have forgotten something out of it about the cattle dying .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mayor</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Maybe you do not know , being much away ,</l>
     <l>How many of our cattle died last winter</l>
     <l>From lacking grass , and that there was much sickness</l>
     <l>Because the poor had nothing but salt fish</l>
     <l>To live upon . The people all came out</l>
     <l>And stood about the doors as I went by .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Seanchan</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>What would you have of me ?</l>
     <l>For there are men that shall be born at last</l>
     <l>And find sweet nurture that they may have voices</l>
     <l>Even in anger like the strings of harps .</l>
     <l>Yet how could they be born to majesty</l>
     <l>If I had never made the golden cradle ?</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mayor</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>What is it ? “ Father ” — “ Mother ” ; that is it ;</l>
     <l>Your father sends this message .</l>

   <sp>
    <speaker>Cian</speaker>
    <p>He is listening .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mayor</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>He says that he is old and that he needs you ,</l>
     <l>And that the people will be pointing at him</l>
     <l>And he not able to lift up his head</l>
     <l>If you should turn the King 's favour away .</l>
     <l>And he adds to it , that he cared you well ,</l>
     <l>And you in your young age , and that it 's right</l>
     <l>That you should care him now .</l>

    <speaker>Cian</speaker>
    <lg>

   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Mayor</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>But your mother</l>
     <l>Has sent no message , for when they had told her</l>
     <l>The way it is between you and the King</l>
     <l>She said , “ No message can do any good ,</l>
     <l>He will not send the answer that you want ;</l>
     <l>We cannot change him , ” and she went indoors ,</l>
     <l>Lay down upon her bed and turned her face</l>
     <l>Out of the light . And thereupon your father</l>
     <l>Said , “ Tell him how she is , and that she sends</l>
     <l>No message . ” I have nothing more to say .</l>
     <l>Cian and Brian , you can set out the food .</l>

     <l>At the King 's table . Nor has poetry</l>
     <l>Been altogether driven away , for I ,</l>
     <l>As you should know , have written poetry ,</l>
     <l>And often when the table has been cleared</l>
     <l>And candles lighted , the King calls for me</l>
     <l>And I repeat it him . My poetry</l>

     <l>If poets had never christened gold , and even</l>
     <l>The moon 's poor daughter , that most whey-faced metal ,</l>
     <l>Precious ; and cry out that none alive</l>
     <l>Would ride among the arrows with high heart</l>
     <l>Or scatter with an open hand , had not</l>
     <l>Our heady craft commended wasteful virtues .</l>
     <l>And when that story 's finished , shake your coat</l>
     <l>Where the little jewels gleam on it , and say</l>
     <l>A herdsman sitting where the pigs had trampled</l>
     <l>Made up a song about enchanted kings ,</l>
     <l>Who were so finely dressed one fancied them</l>
     <l>All fiery , and women by the churn</l>
     <l>And children by the hearth caught up the song</l>

I think he perches on the King 's strong hand , But it may be that he is still too wild . You must not weary in your work ; a King Is often weary and he needs a God To be a comfort to him .<stage>The MONK plucks his habit away . SEANCHAN holds up his hand as if a bird perched upon it .

     <l>That would be haughty , mirthful , and white-bodied</l>

    <speaker>SCENE : A great hall by the sea close to Dundalgan</speaker>
    <p>There are two great chairs on either side of the hall , each raised a little from the ground , and on the back of the one chair is carved and painted a woman with a fish 's tail , and on the back of the other a hound . There are smaller chairs and benches raised in tiers round the walls . There is a great ale vat at one side near a small door , and a large door at the back through which one can see the sea . BARACH , a tall thin man with long ragged hair , dressed in skins , comes in at the side door . He is leading FINTAIN , a fat blind man , who is somewhat older .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Barach</speaker>
    <p>I will shut the door , for this wind out of the sea gets into my bones , and if I leave but an inch for the wind there is one like a flake of sea-frost that might come into the house .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Fintain</speaker>
    <p>What is his name , fool ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Barach</speaker>
    <p>It 's a woman from among the Riders of the Sidhe . It 's Boann herself from the river . She has left the Dagda 's bed , and gone through the salt of the sea and up here to the strand of Baile , and all for love of me . Let her keep her husband 's bed , for she 'll have none of me . Nobody knows how lecherous these goddesses are . I see her in every kind of shape but oftener than not she 's in the wind and cries “ give a kiss and put your arms about me . ” But no , she 'll have no more of me . Yesterday when I put out my lips to kiss her , there was nothing there but the wind . She 's bad , Fintain . O , she 's bad . I had better shut the big door too .</p>
   </sp>
   <stage>He is going towards the big door but turns hearing FINTAIN 'S voice .</stage>

    <p>And this ?</p>
   </sp>

   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Fintain</speaker>
    <p>And this ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>

    <p>A big chair .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Fintain</speaker>
    <p><stage>Feeling the back of the chair .</stage>There is a sea-woman carved upon it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Barach</speaker>
    <p>And there is another big chair on the other side of the hall .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Fintain</speaker>
    <p>Lead me to it .<stage>He mutters while the fool is leading him .</stage>That is what the High King Concobar has on his shield . The High King will be coming . They have brought out his chair .<stage>He begins feeling the back of the other chair .</stage>And there is a dog 's head on this . They have brought out our master 's chair . Now I know what the horse-boys were talking about . We must not stay here . The Kings are going to meet here . Now that Concobar and our master , that is his chief man , have put down all the enemies of Ullad , they are going to build up Emain again . They are going to talk over their plans for building it . Were you ever in Concobar 's town before it was burnt ? O , he is a great King , for though Emain was burnt down , every war had made him richer . He has gold and silver dishes , and chessboards and candlesticks made of precious stones . Fool , have they taken the top from the ale vat ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Barach</speaker>
    <p>They have .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Fintain</speaker>
    <p>Then bring me a horn of ale quickly , for the Kings will be here in a minute . Now I can listen . Tell me what you saw this morning ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Barach</speaker>
    <p>About the young man and the fighting ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Fintain</speaker>
    <p>Yes .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Barach</speaker>
    <p>And after that we can go and eat the fowl , for I am hungry .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Fintain</speaker>
    <p>Time enough , time enough . You 're in as great a hurry as when you brought me to Aine 's Seat , where the mad dogs gather when the moon 's at the full . Go on with your story .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Barach</speaker>
    <p>I was creeping under a ditch , with the fowl in my leather bag , keeping to the shore where the farmer could not see me , when I came upon a ship drawn up upon the sands , a great red ship with a woman 's head upon it .</p>

    <p>A ship out of Aoife 's country . They have all a woman 's head on the bow .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Barach</speaker>
    <p>There was a young man with a pale face and red hair standing beside it . Some of our people came up whose turn it was to guard the shore . I heard them ask the young man his name . He said he was under bonds not to tell it . Then words came between them , and they fought , and the young man killed half of them , and the others ran away .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Fintain</speaker>
    <p>It matters nothing to us , but he has come at last .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Barach</speaker>
    <p>Who has come ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Fintain</speaker>
    <p>I know who that young man is . There is not another like him in the world . I saw him when I had my eyesight .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Barach</speaker>
    <p>You saw him ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Fintain</speaker>
    <p>I used to be in Aoife 's country when I had my eyesight .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Barach</speaker>
    <p>That was before you went on shipboard and were blinded for putting a curse on the wind ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Fintain</speaker>
    <p>Queen Aoife had a son that was red haired and pale faced like herself , and everyone said that he would kill Cuchullain some day , but I would not have that spoken of .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Barach</speaker>
    <p>Nobody could do that . Who was his father ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Fintain</speaker>
    <p>Nobody but Aoife knew that , not even he himself .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Barach</speaker>
    <p>Not even he himself ! Was Aoife a goddess and lecherous ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Fintain</speaker>
    <p>I overheard her telling that she never had but one lover , and that he was the only man who overcame her in battle . There were some who thought him one of the Riders of the Sidhe , because the child was great of limb and strong beyond others . The child was begotten over the mountains ; but come nearer and I will tell you something .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Barach</speaker>
    <p>You have thought something ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Fintain</speaker>
    <p>When I hear the young girls talking about the colour of Cuchullain 's eyes , and how they have seven colours , I have thought about it . That young man has Aoife 's face and hair , but he has Cuchullain 's eyes .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Barach</speaker>
    <p>How can he have Cuchullain 's eyes ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Fintain</speaker>
    <p>He is Cuchullain 's son .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Barach</speaker>
    <p>And his mother has sent him hither to fight his father .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Fintain</speaker>
    <p>It is all quite plain . Cuchullain went into Aoife 's country when he was a young man that he might learn skill in arms , and there he became Aoife 's lover .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Barach</speaker>
    <p>And now she hates him because he went away , and has sent the son to kill the father . I knew she was a goddess .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Fintain</speaker>
    <p>And she never told him who his father was , that he might do it . I have thought it all out , fool . I know a great many things because I listen when nobody is noticing and I keep my wits awake . What ails you now ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Barach</speaker>
    <p>I have remembered that I am hungry .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Fintain</speaker>
    <p>Well , forget it again , and I will tell you about Aoife 's country . It is full of wonders . There are a great many Queens there who can change themselves into wolves and into swine and into white hares , and when they are in their own shapes they are stronger than almost any man ; and there are young men there who have cat 's eyes and if a bird chirrup or a mouse squeak they cannot keep them shut , even though it is bedtime and they sleepy ; and listen , for this is a great wonder , a very great wonder : there is a long narrow bridge , and when anybody goes to cross it , that the Queens do not like , it flies up as this bench would if you were to sit on the end of it . Everybody who goes there to learn skill in arms has to cross it . It was in that country too that Cuchullain got his spear made out of dragon bones . There were two dragons fighting in the foam of the sea , and their grandam was the moon , and nine Queens came along the shore .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Barach</speaker>
    <p>I wo n't listen to your story .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Fintain</speaker>
    <p>It is a very wonderful story . Wait till you hear what the nine Queens did . Their right hands were all made of silver .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Barach</speaker>
    <p>No , I will have my dinner first . You have eaten the fowl I left in front of the fire . The last time you sent me to steal something you made me forget all about it till you had eaten it up .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Fintain</speaker>
    <p>No , there is plenty for us both .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Barach</speaker>

    <speaker>Barach</speaker>
    <p>It is a fine fowl . It was the biggest in the yard .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Fintain</speaker>
    <p>It had a good smell , but I hope that the wild dogs have not smelt it .<stage>Voices are heard outside the door at the side .</stage>Here is our master . Let us stay and talk with him . Perhaps Cuchullain will give you a new cap with a feather . He told me that he would give you a new cap with a feather , a feather with an eye that looks at you , a peacock 's feather .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Barach</speaker>
    <p>No , no .</p>

   <stage>He begins pulling FINTAIN towards the door .</stage>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Fintain</speaker>
    <p>If you do not get it now , you may never get it , for the young man may kill him .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Barach</speaker>
    <p>No , no , I am hungry . What a head you have , blind man ! Who but you would have remembered that the hen-wife slept for a little at noon every day !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Fintain</speaker>
    <p><stage>Who is being led along very slowly and unwillingly .</stage>Yes , I have a good head . The fowl should be done just right , but one never knows when a wild dog may come out of the woods .<stage>They go out through the big door at the back . As they go out CUCHULLAIN and certain YOUNG KINGS come in at the side door . CUCHULLAIN , though still young , is a good deal older than the others . They are all very gaily dressed , and have their hair fastened with balls of gold . The young men crowd about CUCHULLAIN with wondering attention .</stage>First Young King . You have hurled that stone beyond our utmost mark Time after time , but yet you are not weary . Second Young King . He has slept on the bare ground of Fuad 's Hill This week past , waiting for the bulls and the deer .</p>

     <l>Well , why should I be weary ?</l>
     <l>First Young King . It is certain</l>
     <l>His father was the god who wheels the sun ,</l>
     <l>And not King Sualtam .</l>
     <l>Third Young King .</l>
     <stage>To a YOUNG KING who is beside him .</stage>
     <l>He came in the dawn ,</l>
     <l>And folded Dectara in a sudden fire .</l>
     <l>Fourth Young King . And yet the mother 's half might well grow weary ,</l>
     <l>And it new come from labours over sea .</l>
     <l>Third Young King . He has been on islands walled about with silver ,</l>
     <l>And fought with giants .</l>
    </lg>

   <stage>They gather about the ale vat and begin to drink .</stage>

   </sp>

    <p>Yes . Third Young King . Barach and blind Fintain .</p>

     <l>They always flock together ; the blind man</l>

     <l>While the poor fool has need of the other 's wit ,</l>
     <l>And night and day is up to his ears in mischief</l>
     <l>That the blind man imagines . There 's no hen-yard</l>
     <l>But clucks and cackles when he passes by</l>
     <l>As if he 'd been a fox . If I 'd that ball</l>
     <l>That 's in your hair and the big stone again ,</l>
     <l>I 'd keep them tossing , though the one is heavy</l>
     <l>And the other light in the hand . A trick I learnt</l>
     <l>When I was learning arms in Aoife 's country .</l>
     <l>First Young King . What kind of woman was that Aoife ?</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cuchullain</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Comely .</l>
     <l>First Young King . But I have heard that she was never married ,</l>
     <l>And yet that 's natural , for I have never known</l>
     <l>A fighting woman , but made her favours cheap ,</l>
     <l>Or mocked at love till she grew sandy dry .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>

    <p>What manner of woman do you like the best ? A gentle or a fierce ? First Young King . A gentle , surely .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>Cuchullain</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>I think that a fierce woman 's better , a woman</l>
     <l>That breaks away when you have thought her won ,</l>
     <l>For I 'd be fed and hungry at one time .</l>
     <l>I think that all deep passion is but a kiss</l>
     <l>In the mid battle , and a difficult peace</l>
     <l>‘ Twixt oil and water , candles and dark night ,</l>
     <l>Hill-side and hollow , the hot-footed sun ,</l>
     <l>And the cold sliding slippery-footed moon ,</l>
     <l>A brief forgiveness between opposites</l>
     <l>That have been hatreds for three times the age</l>
     <l>Of this long ‘ stablished ground . Here 's Concobar ;</l>
     <l>So I 'll be done , but keep beside me still ,</l>
     <l>For while he talks of hammered bronze and asks</l>
     <l>What wood is best for building , we can talk</l>
     <l>Of a fierce woman .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <stage>CONCOBAR , a man much older than CUCHULLAIN , has come in through the great door at the back . He has many KINGS about him . One of these KINGS , DAIRE , a stout old man , is somewhat drunk .</stage>

     <l>You do , great King .</l>

     <l>And tributary Kings , for now there is peace —</l>
     <l>It 's time to build up Emain that was burned</l>
     <l>At the outsetting of these wars ; for we ,</l>
     <l>Being the foremost men , should have high chairs</l>
     <l>And be much stared at and wondered at , and speak</l>
     <l>Out of more laughing overflowing hearts</l>
     <l>Than common men . It is the art of kings</l>
     <l>To make what 's noble nobler in men 's eyes</l>
     <l>By wide uplifted roofs , where beaten gold ,</l>
     <l>That 's ruddy with desire , marries pale silver</l>
     <l>Among the shadowing beams ; and many a time</l>
     <l>I would have called you hither to this work ,</l>

    <p>Let him speak his mind . I have no need to be afraid of ghosts , For I have made but necessary wars . I warred to strengthen Emain , or because When wars are out they marry and beget And have their generations like mankind And there 's no help for it ; but I 'm well content That they have ended and left the town so great , That its mere name shall be in times to come Like a great ale vat where the men of the world Shall drink no common ale but the hard will , The unquenchable hope , the friendliness of the sword .<stage>He takes thin boards on which plans have been carved by those about him .</stage>Give me the building plans , and have you written That we — Cuchullain is looking in his shield ; It may be the pale riders of the wind Throw pictures on it , or that Mananan , His father 's friend and sometime fosterer , Foreknower of all things , has cast a vision , Out of the cold dark of the rich sea , Foretelling Emain 's greatness .</p>

The YOUNG KINGS gather about him and begin to arm him .</stage>Give me that helmet ! I 'd thought they had grown weary sending champions . That leathern coat will do . The High King there Being old in wisdom can think of times to come , But the hawk 's sleepy till its well-beloved Cries out amid the acorns , or it has seen Its enemy like a speck upon the sun . What 's Emain to the hawk when that clear eye Is burning nearer up in the high air ? That buckle should be tighter . Give me your shield . There is good level ground at Baile 's Yew-tree , Some dozen yards from here , and it 's but truth That I am sad to-day and this fight welcome .<stage>He looks hard at the YOUNG MAN , and then steps down on the floor of the Assembly House . He grasps the YOUNG MAN by the shoulder .</stage>Hither into the light .<stage>Turning to one of the YOUNG KINGS .</stage>The very tint Of her that I was speaking of but now : Not a pin 's difference .<stage>To the YOUNG MAN .</stage>You are from the North , Where there are many that have that tint of hair , Red-brown , the light red-brown . Come nearer , boy ! For I would have another look at you . There 's more likeness , a pale , a stone pale cheek . What brought you , boy ? Have you no fear of death ?</p>

    <p>You take care of me ? You stay safe and send me into every kind of danger . You sent me down the cliff for gull 's eggs while you warmed your blind eyes in the sun .

No , you wo n't get away . Lie there till the Kings come , I 'll tell them all about you . I shall tell it all .

     <l>Till it 's all flame , the wars they blow aflame</l>

     <l>Old fingers and the sleepy strings of harps .</l>

     <l>For I have put you under my protection</l>
     <l>And will reward you well . Dubthach the Chafer .</l>
