The floors are of bright marble ; the throne of ivory , hung with a lion ’ s skin whose head is its footstool . On the right and left , doors , draped with finely woven curtains of purple and white , lead to other portions of the palace . Seats toward the front . Lamps burn low .</stage>
     <stage>The Hall , supported on pillars , is open along the back , where a Porch , surrounding the Court of the palace , crosses . Through the Porch , on the environing hills , glow the camp-fires of the Philistines , the enemies of Israel .</stage>
     <stage>JUDITH , LEAH and ZILLA are reclining restively on the floor of the Hall .</stage>

      <l>The heart of Merab swung a censer to him ,</l>
      <l>My seat at table with the king usurped !</l>
      <l>Mildew and mocking to the harp of Doeg ,</l>
      <l>As it were any slave ’ s ; the while we all</l>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MICHAL</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>He ’ s not at rest ; dreads Samuel ’ s prophecy</l>
      <l>The throne shall pass from him , and darkens more</l>
      <l>Against this boundless Philistine Goliath</l>
      <l>Who dares at Israel daily on the hills ,</l>
      <l>As we were dogs !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>

     <speaker>MICHAL</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>No ;</l>
      <l>But he is sent for — and will ease him — Ah !</l>
      <l>He ’ s wonderful to heal the king with his harp !</l>
      <l>A waft , a sunny leap of melody ,</l>
      <l>And swift the hovering mad shadow ’ s gone —</l>
      <l>As magic !</l>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ISHUI</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Disdaining Doeg and his plea to dust ,</l>
      <l>His waiting and the winning-o ’ er of Edom ,</l>
      <l>You are enamoured of this David too ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MICHAL</speaker>
     <p>I think my brother Ishui hath a fever .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She goes — calmly , with Miriam .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ISHUI</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Now are you kindled — are you quivering ,</l>
      <l>Or must this shepherd put upon us more ?</l>
     </lg>

     <p>And my brother Jonathan ! If I believe it will not miracle Alone bring joy again unto my pain ?<stage>The wailing again without , and deeper groans .</stage>O Israel , the Infinite has touched Thy glory and it changes to a shroud ! Thy splendor is as vintage overspilt . For Saul upon the mountains low is lying , And Jonathan beside him , beautiful Beyond the mar of battle , and of death .<stage>He bows his head in tears .</stage>O kingly Jonathan , would I might give The beating of my life into your veins — Willing for it would I be drouth and die . How are the mighty fallen and the fair !<stage>With lifted arm , deeply moved .</stage>Peaks , mountains of Gilboa , let no more Dew be upon you , and as sackcloth let Clouds cover you , and ashes be your soil , Until I bring upon Philistia And Gath and Askalon extinguishing , And sorrow — and immensity of tears !<stage>MICHAL goes to him and takes his hand . He folds her in his arms .</stage>But we must calm the flowing of this grief . Though yet we cannot mind us to remember Love will as sandal-breath and trickling balm O ’ erheal us in the unbegotten years , Too headlong must not be our agony . Hush now thy woundedness , my Michal , now . See , o ’ er the East the lifted wings of dawn .</p>

    <stage>Slowly they climb the stair to the house-top . At they look away toward the battle ’ s rout the clouds part , and the full brightness of the sun breaks over them .</stage>
