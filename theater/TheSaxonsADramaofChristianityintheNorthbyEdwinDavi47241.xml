     <head type="scene">SCENE ONE — A road through a forest . On either side trees</head>
     <stage type="setting">
      <stage>stand thick and dark . Immediately in front the light sifts down upon a rude bridge spanning a narrow stream . At the roadside , to the right , a large crucifix , apparently new , stands upon a post some ten feet in height . It is elaborately carved and is set in a deep frame to protect it from the weather . At the foot of the post , cut into the mossy bank which slopes toward the road , is a kneeling place with a white sheep 's pelt lying upon it .</stage>
      <stage>A sound of voices is heard . Fritz and Rudolph enter from the left and pause where a path leads off through the wood . The latter has an ax upon his shoulder . Far in the forest a faint sound of chopping is heard .</stage>
     </stage>

      <speaker>TIME — M</speaker>
      <p>id-day in summer , in the early part of the thirteenth century .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>RUDOLPH — N</speaker>
      <p>or would we go had I mine , Fritz . But we Have not our way . The dragon has his way . As far as Niflheim the North is red .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRITZ — A</speaker>
      <p>re we their sheep that we must follow them Or be hung up on trees ?</p>

      <p>ho do these woods belong to , anyhow ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>RUDOLPH — W</speaker>
      <p>here a man puts his foot the dragon puts His belly , and the man 's track disappears . Where is the tree that has not felt the storm ? Have they not disappeared ? Like leaves the tribes Are scattered .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRITZ — I</speaker>
      <p>t has blown down trunk and all .</p>
     </sp>

      <p>orests and rivers and ten thousand graves Lie under that red paw .</p>

      <speaker>FRITZ — I</speaker>
      <p>t stains the world .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>RUDOLPH — T</speaker>
      <p>he Weser rolls down bodies to the sea ; Their yellow hair is matted in the Rhine ; The deer that drinks the Aller in the night Starts back from bloody faces in the stream . They are our fathers , Fritz , who cannot sleep While this coiled Hunger tracks us toward the north .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRITZ — A</speaker>
      <p>nd we must feed it , eh ? We must grub roots , Fatten ourselves on acorns in the wood , As swine do , and then waddle to the swamp And stuff its belly so that it will sleep And trouble us no more , we must do that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>RUDOLPH — N</speaker>
      <p>o ; we must leave , and starve it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRITZ — I</speaker>
      <p>t do n't starve . More hunger means more flesh . Let 's feed it steel .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>RUDOLPH — S</speaker>
      <p>teel draws the blood and brings the hunger on .</p>

      <speaker>RUDOLPH — I</speaker>
      <p>t eats the blade —</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>RUDOLPH — I</speaker>
      <p>t eats our swords and they come out in claws . As Canzler says , a thousand spears have but Peeled off its poisonous scales , and where they fall A deadly fire burns and the elves die .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRITZ — W</speaker>
      <p>e will call Wittikind .</p>

      <speaker>RUDOLPH — W</speaker>
      <p>ittikind was baptized .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRITZ — H</speaker>
      <p>is head was baptized , but his heart was not . A few drops here could not put out a fire That scarred and seamed the dragon till it lashed , Maddened and bleeding , all the tribes away . A spark of him is in this forest .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>RUDOLPH — C</speaker>
      <p>an you or I or chief hasten the day Wherein Val-father 's voice shall wake the North ? What man can say unto the lightning , “ Leap ” ? Of Woden 's race , a million summer leaves , We are , as it were , the winter mistletoe , A lone green sprig with barren woods all round . Can we shake off the snow and say , “ Appear , ” To the young race asleep within the trees ? Cry out above the dragon winter , “ Die ” ? You cannot hurry in its growth one leaf . Yet you would thrust a sword in Oswald 's hands , Thinking to hurry Prophesy along . If naked strength can save us , why not chief 's ? Why Oswald , if the battle is to be now ? Without the aid of Woden , he is naught .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRITZ — W</speaker>
      <p>ithout it , naught , and with it , everything .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRITZ — A</speaker>
      <p>nd Wiglaf 's eyes Blazed glee-fire and his lips spake Woden 's word : “ In him shall be the strength of all your dead . ”</p>
     </sp>

      <p>n Oswald ?</p>

      <p>hy ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>RUDOLPH — W</speaker>
      <p>ould not Oswald 's seed be Wittikind 's ? Do you not see that some child still unborn , The issue of Oswald 's loins , may be the one To take the sword that Woden will hand down ? Meanwhile , suppose the Christians hear of this . Their spies are all about us .<stage>Dropping his voice and pointing to the bridge .</stage>Who knows ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRITZ —</speaker>
      <p><stage>After looking under it .</stage>No .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>RUDOLPH — S</speaker>
      <p>uppose they once get rumor of it . Then Suppose they torture Wiglaf for the rest . Will not a thousand trumpets sound the chase ? Will they not beat the forest through and through , Set fire to it , and when the stag appears Shall breed the fawn shall grow the golden horns —<stage>As though drawing back a bow-string and letting spring the arrow .</stage>Then what ? What then ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p>nd we can keep them .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>RUDOLPH — W</speaker>
      <p>e Can neither keep our swords nor keep ourselves . Who is it plants the white cross in our land ? The Frank ? The Wend ? The Saxon ; we ourselves . No ; in that fire that burns up from the south Thousands of our swords have melted and become Scales on the dragon 's back and teeth and claws That now tear out our hearts . To-day swords strike For Woden , and to-morrow the strange god With those same swords storms Valhal , and lays low Its golden roof . Our ash Iggdrasil dies . Its beautiful leaves fall far off on the sea .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRITZ — L</speaker>

     <sp>
      <speaker>RUDOLPH — S</speaker>
      <p>o falls Iggdrasil and the golden roof comes down . When the North bites , Val-father dies . No , Fritz ; The South has thrown a snake upon the North , And in its trail no fairy can be found . They , too , have gone to the mountains .</p>

      <p>he Saxon sword is broken . The great shield That covered all the North lies in the loam Rusting , and the wild-flowers eat its stains . Where are our fathers , Fritz ? Heimdall , who sees All races , sees not anywhere that race That stood at bay when Swabian went down , Frank and Bavarian and the great North fell . A paw was put upon its breast and lo , It is scattered , blood and bones and heart and brain ! Its hand is here ; its heart is in the north ; Its head far off an island in the sea ; Its blood is everywhere , in grass , in leaves ; Its flesh still fronts the dragon in these trees .</p>

A new shield we will shape us on the heights ; Temper it in the flashes of the sky And boss it with the terror of the grave . Of mountain metal on the mountain tops , New armor we will forge . Let the old shield Lie here upon the plain , covering the dead . Let the leaves cover it . And for the sword That broken lies between the dragon 's paws , Val-father will reach down and put the hilt Of some great Fafnir'shYpppHeNbane in Canzler 's hand , Canzler , in turn , in Oswald 's when he weds , And Oswald and the girl will pass it on Down to the hand of that child —</p>

     <head type="scene">SCENE TWO — Under an old beech in the edge of the forest .</head>
     <stage type="setting">
      <stage>A knoll , like the toe of a large boot shoved in from the rear , butts squarely against the trunk . Up under the boughs , left , lies a decaying log with here and there a tuft of rank grass growing from the cores of old knots . Beside it is a small basket filled with berries . At the foot of the beech , bubbles a spring partly walled in with dark mossy rocks , on top of which lies a brown gourd dipper . Two worn foot-paths , one winding up the slope into the forest , the other entering from the left , meet at the spring . The ground is checkered with flakes of sunlight that fall through the leaves , and over all is the silence of the summer noon .</stage>
      <stage>A crackle is heard as of a dry twig breaking under foot . The branches on the left swing apart and Selma pushes through backwards . She is a fairy-like creature dressed in green . Her hair falls loose about her shoulders and upon her head she wears a coronet of wild-flowers . Holding the boughs slightly apart , she stands peering intently to the left , then , turning quickly , she snatches up the basket and hides it behind the log , and after picking a few green burrs from the branches above her , darts to the right and conceals herself behind the trunk . For a time she stands motionless . Then , as if upon second thought , she stoops and removes the dipper from the rocks .</stage>
      <stage>Along the foot-path , leading in from the left , Oswald enters . He stops and looks back and for a time stands thus , as one undecided , a forlorn expression upon his face . He then turns and proceeds to the spring . Not finding the dipper , he lays aside his staff and hat , and stretches himself out upon the flat stone at the entrance of the spring . While he is drinking , Selma leans cautiously from behind the trunk and raises her arm as if to drop something . Having evidently seen her shadow in the water , Oswald glances up , but seeing no one , lies down again and drinks . From behind the hole Selma tosses a burr into the spring . Oswald continues to drink . Finally he rises , and , taking up his hat and staff , goes up the slope and sits down upon the log . The girl moves stealthily around the trunk .</stage>

      <p>m there yet , then ; you did n't take me out .<stage>She comes round the side of the trunk opposite the log and , stooping over , looks down into the spring .</stage>O you should see the fishes ! two , three , four , A troop of them ! O Oswald , come and see ! They 're round a splash of sunlight in the spring . See how they twinkle and in the current stir Their little crimson fins . Ah , I 've scared them . I really did ; I scared them with my hair . See how it fell .<stage>She points to a mass of hair that has fallen past her cheek .</stage>It would not hurt them , though . We must be still ; we must not say a word . They never will play if they see us looking .<stage>Oswald points down into the spring .</stage>That little green thing ? That 's a beech-nut burr . I threw it in to scare the water-sprite That looked up at you when you stooped to drink . You did not see her ? Oh , I did . I peeped Like this , softly , over , over the edge , And saw her peeping from the mossy stones Down in the spring . Her hair was loose like mine And brown as buckeyes , and her lips were stained With juice of berries . Then I raised my hand . Thinks I : “ I 'll drop a beech-nut on his head . ” Then she raised hers as if to say : “ Be still ! I 'll make the bubbles break against his nose . ” Was that what made you jump ? You scared her so . I saw her hair fly up about her face As I leaped back . She lives down in the spring . This morning as I passed I stooped and said : “ I 'm going after berries ; wo n't you come ? ” She beckoned to me , too , and seemed to say : “ I can n't leave home ; my little fish will stray . You come down here ; I have some pretty shells . ” Oh , look ! Be still ! She 's let them come again . See them flash .</p>

      <p>h , do look ! You are not thinking of the fishes . See ! They follow it through the dimples round and round , Paddling the current with their little fins , And poising . They 're afraid . They 're drawing back . There , by the green stone .</p>

Oh , oh !<stage>She runs down to the outlet of the spring by which the minnow has passed out , and walks up and down , stooping occasionally to feel among the stones of the rill . Oswald goes back and sits down upon the log . After a while Selma rises and looks toward the spring . The trunk is between her and Oswald .</stage>‘ Twill grieve her so .<stage>In a low chant , abstractedly .</stage>She 's sleeping in the spring Under the dark rock where the white sand pours . The moss is softer in the forest there , And there the wood-doves coo . He 's going away ; they told me yesterday . The forest heard them moan : He will not come . The chestnut burr shall break ; The wild bird , feeding , shake Unpicked the purple hartcrops to the ground , And the hushed forest only hear the sound Of antlers knocking where the wild deer rubs . He 's going away — away — away .</p>

      <p>e is the prince of fairies and of fiends . Father Paul says that oft on stormy nights , When stars scarce venture to the brink of heaven , Witches go down the sky scattering fogs , Diseases , blights , and death , and with them go Those whom their cursed arts have wrought upon To taste the air of Hell . Far in the West , From every quarter of the earth and sky And from those awful rivers , they assemble And hold their sabbaths on a windy cliff , A headland hanging over the edge of the world , About whose base an ocean bellows so That nothing dares approach save frenzied things . There , while the moon protrudes an awful horn Far off at sea and rocks among the waves , They curse God 's watchful planets from the sky And lead their converts , dizzy with the brew , To trample on the blood of Christ and swear To serve the arch-demon who is known to them As Barrabam . A while ago you said You did not know his name as Satan . Selma ,—</p>

      <p>elma , listen to me just this once , And then forever listen to the years Give back the echo of this golden hour . Do you remember that day in the wood When we were gathering may-apples ? You ran Shouting : “ Here is a large one , ” and you stooped To pick it , when a snake coiled round the stalk , Hissed at you and you started back in fear . Had it not hissed you never would have known That it was there , so green it was , so like The stalk it coiled about . You saw that one Because it hissed . But one that hisses not Is coiled about the world , as like the world As was the green one to the may-flower stalk .</p>

The fairies scampered off Into the ferns . The little water elf I found up close against a gnarled oak trunk , Hid in a moss-pink in a drop of dew . Oh , she was tiny as a fairykin ! Her hair was scattered , she was frightened so . You should have seen her how she looked at me , As if to say : “ You here ! ” I nod , and then We laugh together , thinking of the trick The surly owl played .<stage>Again she circles round in a dance .</stage></p>

      <stage>trees , to the right , is seen the home of Canzler , a small cottage built of logs , with antlers over the doorway . It sits in a space partially cleared , and the light falls golden about it . Among the trees in the foreground , where the shadows are thicker , is the stump of a large oak and a newly fallen trunk extending out left . Over to the right , at the foot of one of the trees , lies a small bundle fastened to the end of a stick . At intervals a bird is heard singing in the forest .</stage>
      <stage>Near the stump several men are gathered . Canzler , facing right , stands beside the log with his hand resting upon his ax . He is bareheaded . His sleeves are rolled up above his elbows and his shirt , open in front , discloses his broad , hairy breast . Near the stump stands Hartzel , a man apparently seventy years of age . He wears a long , white beard and his hands are folded on top of a tall rustic staff . The others are Fritz and Rudolph and Wiglaf , the gleeman , in a fantastic garb faded and tattered . On the other side of the log , to the right of Canzler , is Max , another woodman , also in his shirt sleeves .</stage>

      <p>hy is it not enough to be a man ? To do a man 's work and to live a life Free like the wild deer , and to grow like these ?<stage>He looks about upon the trees .</stage>You , Hartzel , have lived longer than we have And you have seen more seasons , and you know In father Woden 's forests how the trees Grow as they will , acknowledging no lord But him who made them to be lordless , and Obeying no law save that law that bids Each be itself and bring forth its own fruit . In all the populous forests of this world There is no tyrant tree that lifts its head Above the rest and says , “ Obey my law . ” For each tree hath its own law in itself , And no tree hears another , but each hears The voice of father Woden in the loam Laying the law of selfhood on each seed . The seed bursts and the law starts toward the sky . The acorn lays it softly on the oak , The chestnut on the chestnut , and the pine Upon the loftiest mountain hears its cone Whispering with father Woden in the air , Learning the law it taketh to the ground . Thus by that law that each tree be itself , This forest hath become a stalwart state , A nation governed by one law , a vast Green kingdom of ten thousand happy trees With father Woden monarch in the boughs . The law of selfhood is the law of trees ; Who says the law of sameness governs man ? Because the South has not the girth of trunk To bear Val-father 's weight upon its boughs , Must he climb down from ours and let the South Climb up and with its law bind leaf and limb ? Did he , who made these oaks to grow and spread Their branches , make our branching minds to be Pinched to a point and put inside a ring ?</p>

       <l>Eternal mid the hills . Of old they forged</l>
       <l>Law for our fathers , and , with iron hands ,</l>
       <l>Welded it on them . For five hundred years</l>
       <l>The noise of that old furnace filled the world ,</l>
       <l>And from her red mouth link on link her hands</l>
       <l>Drew one continuous shackle , and the North</l>
       <l>Walked heavily , until Val-father 's spear</l>
       <l>Flashed southward . Then the noise stopped . The great beast ,</l>
       <l>That wore for head and neck those seven hills ,</l>
       <l>Roused her and saw her whelps come bleeding back</l>
       <l>And heard wild Tyr holloing the tribes for dogs</l>
       <l>Round her on every side , and rose at bay</l>
       <l>And clawed through bloody foam and ceased and saw</l>
       <l>Her hills go round and round and with a crash</l>

      <p>ones , Hartzel , are not dead . The life returns . The ghastly thing moves in the silent night When swords are sleeping and the ear hears not . Old hands scratch round old battle-fields and there The skulls that wore the helmet don the hood , And when the morning breaks no man will say . “ The thing that stands there is the thing that fell . ” Our father found it so . For after that Great hunt down in the south , the tribes lay down And slept and woke and saw — they knew not what . It wore a sword , but had no hauberk on . ‘ Twas robed in black and on each shoulder sat What seemed an eagle in a vulture 's plumes . They , too , thought bones were dead , and seeing no Mark of their swords upon it nor anywhere The indenture of those old hills in the south , They showed it all the paths among the tribes .</p>

      <p>artzel , the past and present are two limbs On one tree . Though the one bears withered leaves And these on this around us here are green , The trunk is the same ; the sap is the same ; The new fruit is the old fruit . What to-day Is Wiglaf fleeing to the ocean isles But the whole Saxon race ? What is his harp In ashes but our homes and all this land ? Are those graves yonder old ? Were these , our scars ,<stage>Opening his bosom .</stage>Handed down from our fathers ? When we start Alarmed in the night , is it the past we fear ? There is no past to things that have been dead . It is a scabbard empty of its sword . What shall we do ? Accept their Faith ?</p>

      <p>ithout it , we must steal the air we breath And thank Val-father if we get it then . Their blades are out ; shall we not lift our shields ? Wolves are we ? Wolves are not hunted so . Bears have the caves ; must our cave be the grave ? There is no room there . How then can we die ? After his great meal , Death hath lain him down . Famine , the gleaner , has the field . There is No plot unreaped , no sheaf unflailed . The barns Are stuffed to breaking with the dead . And we , In this great carnage , in this harvest-home , The last few straws whisked from the threshing-floor , Hunted by that old Hunger of the south From field to wood , from wood to darker wood , Far up strange rivers and — down under them — Hartzel , remember ; when we fall , there goes Down the whole North . We alone stand . Of all Val-father 's oaks , there 's but one acorn left That can re-forest and make green the North . Rudolph and you and I and the rest , save one , Are , as it were , its protecting shell . Off there , A sword is coming toward us , and shall we With hands down take the point and hear the unborn Wail of that child that should have filled the north With shouts and wound his horn upon its hills ? Behind him , in array , the dead tribes come On fire for the south ; their umbered shields Upon the gunwales lour ; and shall the snake Swallow the haven where that host must land ? See the North die ? Never .<stage>He turns as if to call Rudolph .</stage></p>

     <stage type="setting">
      <stage>From the bones that lie about , one would imagine it to be a den to which wild beasts drag and devour their prey . To the right , a vine , growing out of the crevice in the rear wall , shows by its leaves becoming a darker green as it spreads to the right that the entrance is in that direction and near by . Bowlders , evidently used for seats , lie here and there , and in the rear , center , a smouldering fire throws their shadows about the floor and walls . Several willow baskets freshly woven hang on pegs driven into seams in the rocks . To the left , an old spinning wheel with a thread trailing from it , and near it , upon the floor , a quantity of black wool . Farther over in the corner , a couch of rushes and forest grass . From the ledge that projects out over it hang bunches of dry herbs . In the left wall , extending to the ceiling and barely wide enough to admit of one 's passing through , is a cleft whence are heard at intervals the muffled sound of hammers far down in the earth .</stage>
      <stage>To the right of the fire , Sigurd , the dwarf , is peeling osiers . He is barefooted . About his neck he wears a string of buckeyes . Beside him , upon the floor , lies a pile of white osiers newly peeled . Occasionally he takes the withes in his mouth and tears the bark off with his teeth . On the other side of the fire , reclining upon his elbow , the gnome Kilo is poking the coals with a stick .</stage>
      <stage>Despite the red glow of the fire , the cave is quite dark .</stage>

       <l>Sees farther than Woden 's ravens can .</l>
       <l>At dusk I crept over behind the town .</l>
       <l>Some boys were up on the mountain side</l>
       <l>Running a cow they were driving down ,</l>
       <l>With puff-balls pelting her brindled hide .</l>
       <l>On a slope of heather I knew a sink</l>
       <l>Where a brown backed bunny was wont to squat ,</l>
       <l>To warm his fur in the sun and wink</l>
       <l>At the shadows darkening a cabbage plot .</l>
       <l>Says I : “ Now Zory will have some fun .</l>
       <l>He 'll start the hare for the village boys</l>
       <l>And hear them hollo and see them run . ”</l>

       <l>They will soon be off , and , flying the noise ,</l>
       <l>Wat will go bobbing across the down .</l>
       <l>I 'm off for the heather when lo , I hear ,</l>
       <l>Behind the sallows that fringe the foss ,</l>
       <l>A sneeze and a sigh and then , “ O dear ! ”</l>
       <l>Some women are trying to get across .</l>
       <l>I hide in the dock . The dames pass by</l>
       <l>With baskets of bennet . I hear one say :</l>
       <l>“ With our dear Lord hanging upon the tree ,</l>
       <l>And oh , such a beautiful , beautiful cross</l>
       <l>No one ever saw , so the people say</l>

       <l>In another day and another day</l>
       <l>My every prayer will have been fulfilled .</l>
       <l>May the Virgin spare us . ” The other sighs</l>
       <l>And , scanning the shadowy mountain side :</l>
       <l>“ I fear he will never complete it , Clotilde .</l>
       <l>He climbs that dreadful mountain at night .</l>
       <l>Can you see him now ? Oh , I fear , I fear</l>
       <l>Those awful rocks where the devils hide !</l>
       <l>It seems so dark . Rosa , is the moon up , dear ? ”</l>
       <l>To see the old dame as she —</l>
       <stage>Mimicing with the sword for a cane .</stage>
       <l>daddled on</l>
       <l>With her skirt in her hand , through the dewy grass ,</l>
       <l>Her little whisket of herbs on her arm</l>
       <l>To keep off the devils , and mumbling a mass</l>
       <l>And snuffling and moaning and sighing , “ O dear !</l>
       <l>It 's a wicked world . ”</l>

     <stage type="setting">
      <stage>An open court , with buildings dimly seen in the darkness . To the right , the dormitory , a large structure built of stone , with high , deep-set windows protected by heavy shutters which are closed . Across the court a high wall , starting in front , extends back some fifteen feet and abuts the side of the chapel before which in outline long stone steps may be discerned . In the center of the wall is an archway with a pair of ponderous iron gates . The night is dark and windy .</stage>

He 's for a beast , he fronts it i ’ the dark , Blazing its pretty orbs wi ’ his big torch . His eye 's a rook 's eye and his spear as true As the bolt o ’ the buskined hussy what you say Drops from the moon i ’ the dead o ’ night and hunts Naked i ’ the woods . She 's a — I 'm a monk , though . An you could see him coming through the copse , Shuffling the dews away , zooks , you would say The burnt faced fellows of Libya were for sure Making a revel feast for the big god . The game ! the game ! Sweet , tender prickets , Stags and chamois calves , pheasants and geese , Turtles and loaches and toper horse-fish Wi ’ fins as red as blood . God bless us , though .

      <p>h ! The Abbot hears me trill that heathen song , I 'll get no chick-weed . It 's a foul song .<stage>He comes forward and looks round the corner of the dormitory , then returns to the window .</stage>A cricket chirped it from a chink i ’ the wall As the old man dozed dreaming o ’ green fields , Up there .<stage>He sings .</stage>The grass is food for the ewe And the ewe is food for man And man is food for the green , green grass And the grass for the ewe again . The foul song makes goat 's food of us all .

     <stage>Suddenly around the farther corner of the chapel the light reappears . Soloman snatches-to the shutter . Old Andrew blows out his taper and gets down upon his knees by the wall . Macias , the hunter , carrying a pine torch , comes forward across the court .</stage>

      <p><stage>To Soloman .</stage>A while ago I started up from sleep And hurried to the kennel , thinking sure I 'd find old Fever sick again ; but no ; The bitch was sleeping . And yet I heard a howl . It may have been the white hound in my dream . I seemed to be out on the mountain there . ‘ Twas early morning ; a few stars still shone Above the village . Soon , far down the road , I heard a baying as of hounds . Thinks I : “ A deer has passed and waked the village dogs . Now for a chase . ” There must have been a slot Of fresh blood on the road that fired the pack , For on they came like mad . Around the cliff Long bodies swung like shadows through the mist , And tore on up the mountain . Farther up A stag plunged from a hazel copse , and then A snow-white talbot , following close behind , Shot smoking from the brake . “ Abloy ! ” I cried , And leaped upon a rock . The after-pack , Nosing the vent along the mountain road , Heard the loud challenge of the leading hound And , breaking trail , came crashing through the brush And spied the quarry , and with their heads in air Sprang after up the scree , their steaming mouths Ringing the mountains round . The pretty deer , With nostrils flaming and with dappled flanks Torn by the furze , came skirting round a rock And turned to dash under some low-hung boughs When over a near knoll the hot , sinewy hound , Like to a cat-o ’ - mountain from a limb , Shot through the air . Crash through the boughs he went . Sprinkling the earth with leaves . Out jumped my knife , And , leaping from the rock , I hurried down To slit the poor brute 's throat and save a steak From the mad , hungry pack . The pretty buck Staggered beneath the hound , while the beads of blood Dripped from the quivering hocks . The head fell back , The tender haunches sank on the soft turf , And death was closing up the eyes , when lo , Sancta Maria , what a miracle !<stage>He pauses a moment , then proceeds with more and more animation .</stage>A gale had risen and the clouds that hung Gray in the heavens when the chase began , Foamed , and , flying black before the winds , Grappled the woods and threw his thick , green hair Into the swirling rack of livid sky . Lightnings and thunders , winds and tumbling rocks Charged on the pack of dogs as though they were Devils come up from Hell , and hurled them down Into the pit again . Under the beech Where the white talbot had pulled down the buck Behold the miracle the Virgin wrought ! Out of a dallop of green boughs that hung Close to the haunches of the hart appeared A pair of small pink hands that with one wrench Tore the hound 's jaws apart . The deer rose up As from a sleep , shook his brown coat and browsed The succulent green twigs , then wandered off Up the dark mountain side , whilst like a star Between the dim , dissolving antlers shone A crucifix of silver , dripping blood .<stage>Several shutters in the second story have opened and faces are seen white in the glare of the torch . Old Andrew , frightened , has drawn back in the shadow against the wall .</stage>Lo , then a sight such as I hope our Lord Will visit to these dying eyes of mine In their last hour . The louring mountain brows Brightened beneath a drift of golden feet , And wings waved in the air , and faces bloomed In the edding sky , and the dark towering ridge , Lifting its weight of crags above the storm , Sloughed off its shadow , and the field of pines , Like a green army climbing to the clouds Out of the darkness of the dale below , Shook their victorious plumes , and every rock , Tree , bush , and vine , and weed , and flower sent up Voices of joy till all the mountains rang .</p>

      <stage>cliff that plunges down from the edge of a pine-wood . Overhead the wind is heard moaning in the trees , and upon the ground patches of moonlight wave to and fro . From the left , past some bushes which almost hide the road from view , the dwarf , Sigurd , appears carrying the monk , Oswald , limp in his arms . The latter 's face is so emaciated that one would never recognize him as the same person as was seen in the forest some three years ago . His feet , upon which are heavy wooden shoes , drag along the road . Suddenly from somewhere in his clothing the large silver crucifix falls to the ground . The dwarf stoops , and , resting the monk upon his knee , reaches down and secures the crucifix , which he puts between his teeth . Then , having gotten a new hold , he rises and , with difficulty , makes his way up the road .</stage>

      <p>ore than two years have passed and not a word Was ever said to throw the claim in doubt ; But now that Hartzel is about to die They think to get the whole tract for the Church , Upon the ground that he who sold the land To Hartzel was apostate to their Faith .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CANZLER — W</speaker>
      <p>hat am I going to tell them ? Tell them what Val-father tells the mountains , tells the rocks , The trees , the beasts , the birds , all things that live . Woden , who made all things , made each to be Different from the rest . He made the oak To bear its acorns and the pine its cones . The mole to burrow and the fox to run , The eagle to hatch her brood upon the crag Under the sun , the bat , in the dark cave . The ox to eat grass , and the lion flesh , And each to go its own particular way Upon a path as separate and clear As are the curves and risings of the stars .<stage>Fritz and Conrad come forward .</stage>He made no bell to ring all things that live To sameness in their lives or in their thought . To keep them , as he made them , different , He gave to each an individual taste And matched the taste within with that without Which , when the two meet , the result is joy . Joy is the voice of each thing as it moves Toward Woden on the path that he laid out . The eagle finds its way without a guide To Woden , and the stars without a guide , Each in its own light , and all things that live , From the blind worm to the all-seeing sun , Follow their joy and come at last to him . The eagle 's right to go the eagle 's way Is not conditioned by another thing Save by the fact alone that it is so : That Woden gave to it an eagle 's wings . And so with man . To what man has a right , He has a right because he is a man And not because he is a kind of man . Val-father 's bells have each a different tone . You cannot make the million aisles that lead To him one aisle and drive all things through that , Or make the right of each to be and to have Rest on its answering a particular bell . If we admit their principle that Faith , Or anything outside the fact that one Is a man , is the basis of the rights of man , We shame our Saxon fathers who fought and died For a lie , if this be true . For when the South Pushed through the Frankish forest with her sword Between her teeth , and stained with blood , and held Her hands out , saying , “ Here , take this or this , ” Our fathers chose the darkness of the grave From the red hand , and left the black hand filled With that which now to keep itself alive Eats Hartzel 's land and licks its fangs toward us . When the great night came on and they laid down Under their battered shields and broken swords , The trees have told us what their last word was : “ The northern air will kill the southern lie ; Then we will come again . Remember this . ”</p>

     <stage type="setting">
      <stage>of the second act . The large crucifix which was seen in the forest in the first Act is fixed above the door of the chapel . On either side of the door is a stained glass window , the farther one depicting the Transfiguration , the nearer one , the legend of St. Giles . The deer with blood dripping from a wound in its haunch stands behind the saint who holds in his hand an arrow with blood upon its tip . The emporer and his huntsmen are presenting the saint with golden cups . The deer is watching them . Several rude benches of stone are ranged alongside of the dormitory . In the rear , about ten feet back from the building , a low stone wall extends across , passing behind the dormitory on the one side and the chapel on the other . To the left , far back , is seen the side of the mountain on which the abbey stands . The upper part is thickly wooded , and below , where the timber is sparse , a road winds down the cliff to the village . Farther down , the slope becomes more precipitous and is covered with bowlders and stunted evergreens , some of which have been broken off by rocks tumbling from the cliff above . Off to the right , a space of sky with the snow-peaks flashing in the sunlight . To the left in the last Scene , they are now far to the right .</stage>
      <stage>From a door in the dormitory facing the court , Ely and Pierre enter . The former has a hunting horn suspended from his shoulder by a chain , and in his hand a small wooden crucifix . Pierre carries two large silver candelabra . They come out talking .</stage>

And the fiends , That fly with darkness from the pit of death To conjure with the baleful midnight stars And wreck God 's holy chime of human souls , Are scourged to Hell , and all the rebel orbs Are thunder-stunned . Vapors and noxious fogs That hatch contagion in rank , drizzling swamps , Will soon beneath the lightning 's flagellum With breezes fan their fevers from the blood , And with pure sea-dews from green ocean urns Sprinkle the parched earth to cool the vines Preparing clusters of our dear Lord 's blood . The serpent spawn of imps and evil dreams , Fairies and watching wanderers of the night , That kennel in the bowels of the earth And taint its waters , blight the tender sprouts , And sow infections through the flocks and herds , Have flown like bats into the squalid caves , And there are numb with fear . O'er Zion 's towers The virgin dawn brings forth the sun of God And smiles upon the world . The blessed light Spreads o'er the earth its bright , archangel wings , Dripping with balmy dews and cassia smells .

A few walk back in the rear and stand looking up at the road .

      <p>o , not that . His fall , his being found before the gate , All that , no doubt , the villagers last night Poured into their ears . The folk are deeply stirred . From tongue to tongue the flame of rumor runs That heavenly hands bore Oswald from the gulch . They think the holy saints have blessed his palms With power of healing and of miracles . Alms have increased ten-fold . Cattle and sheep , Jewels and coin , and corn and casks of wine Pour in from every side . Within a year , St. Giles will swell her roofs and shine in gold —<stage>Confidentially .</stage>Provided , Louis , provided . You understand ?</p>

      <speaker>ABBOT — A</speaker>
      <p>y , that 's it . You understand . The quarry for our domes is in our brains . Here , in our brains , your brain and mine , Louis , We have the shuttle of that wonderous loom That shall array her in her cloth-of-gold . Here is the sun , the bridegroom of the grape . And here , from hills of France and Italy , The purple bride shall come and loose her zone And lay her dower in the abbey 's lap . Lock up that jewel , Louis , in its case . Let it not get abroad that you suspect — Suspect , I say ; you surely do not know —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOUIS — I</speaker>
      <p>only know of what I heard and saw . I heard his voice and —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ABBOT — Y</speaker>
      <p>ou were fast asleep .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOUIS — A</speaker>
      <p>t first I was ; then , wakened by the shout , Three times I heard him cry out in the dark : “ Haro ! help ! help ! ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ABBOT — A</speaker>
      <p>voice , of course ; but whose ? The night so alters sound you cannot tell . A cat-o ’ - mountain screaming in the dark For all the world sounds like a wailing child .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOUIS — B</speaker>
      <p>ut when I see the track , I 'll tell you then . The track up by the gate , and it 's there now , Is the dwarf 's track , four toes on the left foot .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ABBOT — P</speaker>
      <p>reposterous , Louis , that this hunched devilock , Brought up on witch 's dugs , in the dead of night Should be about the service of the Lord . Asses can talk like men when angels bid . Perhaps the angels , taking him in the act Of throwing brother Oswald from the cliff , Scourged him before them to the abbey gate And made him in his pain cry out for help And set his print to attest the power of God . Who knows ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOUIS — B</speaker>
      <p>rother Oswald , perhaps .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ABBOT — O</speaker>
      <p>nly God . But make no mention of the witch 's son . When truth is whist and doubt a favoring gale Blowing toward golden islands in the sea , Let the ship drive before it into port . No one was with you when you found him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOUIS — N</speaker>
      <p>o one .</p>

      <p>nd no one saw you .</p>

      <speaker>LOUIS — N</speaker>
      <p>o one . It was still dark ; The brothers were asleep .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ABBOT — S</speaker>
      <p>ay nothing of it . Let rumor blow it as a miracle . Sweet feet of saints have run down in the night And with a touch enriched a holy house Of no more worth than this of good St. Giles . Rumor of saints can do as much as saints . If thoughts of bright wings stirring in the sky Can kindle hearts to deeds of charity , And by those deeds the Virgin 's chapels rise , Let the flame run . We 'll blow it through the land . I 've had the brothers circulate report That wings were seen dissolving in the dawn Above the mountains .</p>

       <l>So , perhaps , there were —</l>
       <l>Of eagles wheeling airily in the clouds .</l>
       <l>Is this not , Father , to build upon the sand ?</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ABBOT — T</speaker>
      <p>o build on sand is to build on a lie .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOUIS — W</speaker>
      <p>hat is a lie ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ABBOT — A</speaker>
      <p>lie is not a thing That is not , but a thing that cannot be . Thus to say good is evil is a lie , For good cannot be evil . But to say That that hath been which God hath power to do Is to make faith a fact . In days like these , When the Albigensian heresy is rank , We must support the Holy Writ in this , That what is done in thought is done in deed . Has a good deed been done ? Then a good thought Has done that deed , and that good thought is God 's , And such thoughts we call angels .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOUIS — O</speaker>
      <p>swald , then , Was rescued by the angels ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ABBOT — W</speaker>
      <p>ithout doubt . The globe of fire that Dominic beheld Above our Lady 's chapel in the plain Of Prouille was a light in his own mind .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOUIS — T</speaker>
      <p>he multitude will never understand This nice distinction .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ABBOT — J</speaker>
      <p>ust so ; but shall we Show them the foul body of fair Truth Or the clear spirit ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOUIS — T</speaker>
      <p>he spirit , Father . I never doubt the end you have in view .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ABBOT — Y</speaker>
      <p>ou doubt the means , though . Deep down in your heart You smile and say : “ But Father is all right . The times are fire , and fight for Benedict . To build the abbey , Father must have gold . To get the gold , the people must be bilked . But Father will return them light for gold . I never doubt the end he has in view . ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOUIS — Y</speaker>
      <p>ou are the brain , Father ; I , the hand . You know that I would help you . You know that .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ABBOT — A</speaker>
      <p>nyway , Louis , I am justified . For simple souls find joy in simple faith . Go down into the village . Guido tells me Their faces shine because of this bright thing . It purifies and cheers them . Cyprian says There is no power that does not come from God . He might have said the same of light and joy , And shall I , to whom what I know this thing is Seems quite as strange as what they think it is — That angels did it —, take their light away Because I know it falls not from a star ? A thousand lamps burn in the House of Life . Shall I walk through its chambers and say : “ This , Children , and this , now these were lit of Hell ; But that one there — see how the oil of God Goes up the wick and throws a brighter flame ” ? Unless they see it brighter , it is not . They cannot see it so without my eye . They cannot have my eye and keep their own , And they must keep their own a little while ; At least until I get my abbey built , Until I shout the sun from out the sea And with its beams illumine the valley there . And since its rising on their gifts depends , And since their gifts depend on their belief , I cannot tell them their belief is false ; ‘ Twould bring the abbey down upon their heads ; And Benedict would shout forevermore , Seeing their night come back without a star . And so I cannot tell them what is true . Nothing is sadder than to see a mind Drifting between an old faith torn away And a new rock not risen from the waves . Their wisp must burn until the sun comes up . Our Lord himself tempered his dazzling truth To simple minds , and spake in parables , Leaving the halo on the brow of things . And shall we blow it away ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOUIS — I</speaker>

      <p>hat should I say ? “ Your eye sees false ” ? If they think rue will keep the devils off , To kill their thought would bring the devils back And leave them fleeing Hell , not seeking God ; A different thing though Benedict knows it not . They are not ready for the larger life , And in a day I cannot make them so . They cannot take my light . Shall I take theirs , Their little light , and leave them in the dark ? Take from their hearts the glory and the hope ? How do I know what God means by this thing ? If they should ask me I must drop my eyes And say : “ He hides to-morrow from to-day , ” Which is no answer , Louis , and I know it . What can I do ? No , I must seem to lie : While I am serving God , seem to serve Hell ; Pray to the Giver of Light , “ Thy will be done , ” And then give darkness ! Oh , for some power , Some angel , Louis , that should come from heaven And free us from these bonds of policy ! That we must hide our light like secret parts As though each shining ray were snake of Hell ! Oh , that some god would step down on the peaks And make us throw our thought out on the dark , As fields their seeds , leaving the god of growth To separate and slay and bring to sheaf ! How I would lay this cope and this aside , And with my face upon the mountains run , Aye , run to meet the bright thing coming down , And cry , “ Hail , hail , hail , hail , thou blessed one ! ”<stage>Shaking with emotion , his voice husky .</stage>I cannot be a man !</p>

      <p>hat prophesy that Oswald brings , may it Not mean this very thing , that by his fall And this bright rumor that the angels saved him , A summer cloud that seems to rain down gold , May it not be that by this very gold Your tower of light shall rise upon this rock And save the North from darkness ? May it not ?</p>

      <p>ut who will save us from our policy , From playing hide and seek with God 's bright son , From the necessity of withholding truth From those to whom the vital thing belongs , Who do not even hunger for it more , Who live and die about a taper 's flame , Calling it star , and sun , salvation , God — And here all round us — Louis , look , the dawn !</p>

      <speaker>ABBOT — Q</speaker>
      <p>uality , Louis , is not quantity . The myriad spheres of dew leave the fields dark . The midnight luster on the swamp is light , Enough to guide the wild thing paddling there . The willow leaves give light unto the moth . The stars that fill us with the life to come Leave darkness in the prowling tiger 's eye , And rise and set upon its curve of ball . God made the day for higher things than these . Some light is not enough for something more Than moth and water-rat and prowling maws That find their food in flesh . With what design Lit God the radiant pages ? For what purpose Hung he the planet Plato in the sky With kindred constellations of pure thought , If I , a mortal man , can lift my hand And leave a shadow in the valley there ? It fills my life with meaning to know this , That God hath ordered so our spiritual world That every bright thing needs my will to shine , As it needs His to reach the shining state . Think of such confidence of God in man ! And I betray it .<stage>He walks about thoughtfully .</stage></p>

      <p>ray God It may be , Louis , pray God it may be . That unknown god should have an altar here . No , Louis : what I mean is simply this : This thing that we call evil , may it not Be the other side of this thing we call good , The passing of bright planets of the mind , Dreaming eclipse that is no thing at all , Simply the passing of the two things , both bright ? God ever wrestles with his shadow , Louis , And now the bright goes down and now the dark : And man stands by and watches the great game With heart divided and with swaying mind And lifts whichever falls . The game goes on Forever , and the nations rise and fall Forever , and fall and rise . And so they strive , Like light and shade over the mountain slopes , Each wrestling not for victory but strength .</p>

      <speaker>ABBOT — N</speaker>
      <p>ot if it gives him strength To do the work his spirit bids him do , To wrestle with the dark and with the bright , To wrestle better than he did before . And shake the fruit down of that prophesy . Who knows what God behind the horizon holds For Oswald till the dawning of that day ? I somehow feel the dream is , as it were , The warp to which the prophesy is woof , And that beneath the hills unseen a loom Rocks as it weaves in dogs and storm and deer And underneath the meaning of it all . But I was speaking of the witch 's son . This pebble here I take up in my hand . I turn it , yet I always see one side . The other side is toward the underworld , And though I turned it till the Judgment Day , That side would still be round there . Bid it grow , Swell to a bowlder 's , now the chapel 's size , And now a globe 's . And let us hold it thus . Above us , on our palms . Like Atlas now I stand supporting it .<stage>Pointing as though under the globe .</stage>Down here I see A little night following a little day About a water-drop , a grain of sand , A point in which my spirit lives and moves .<stage>Reaching up and around .</stage>How do I know that up here are not worlds Lit with Gods ’ providence and bathed with soul ? What is my thought that it should scale these zones And take my law of good and evil there And recreate that life to what I know ? Is my eye God 's , that it should see all things ? From what far mountains come the grains of gold That sparkle in the river of my soul ? Ranges of being and tall peaks of thought May hold up here a brighter metal still , Some burning thing would dry my river bed . The dreams that vein the dark sky of our sleep , As lightnings vein the night and then are gone , Whence come they and whither go they , that they leave Vast expectation and the vacant eye ? And out beyond the chalice of our sleep That cases round my dew-drop soul , who knows What oceans roar with life beyond our life , And spray with stars the dark rocks of the void ? How do I know what creatures come and go Beyond my little line of night and day , Doing the will of the Eternal Mind ? I am not Benedict to say , “ This is He , And this is not . ”</p>

      <p>od is the author of the book we see Whose pages are the mountains and the stars . Though He may sit aloof , his soul pervades Each word and letter . Prowling in the spring , The mountain lion feels Him in her paws , And the wild creatures of the caves are His .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ABBOT — ‘ T</speaker>
      <p>is past my thought How He should not be ;— in his rising , too . If God is with me when I climb a hill , When I descend do I leave God somewhere Upon the top ? If only he ascends , How came he in the valley , then , at first ? Only the ignorant halve the universe And thresh events and say , “ The wheat is God 's , ” Piecing their small minds out with nothingness . The chaff too served its purpose in its time And while it served its purpose it was good And like the wheat it drew its strength from God . Having served its end , is wheat itself not chaff ? If Oswald 's fall is evil in our minds , It is because we do not see its place . But where my knowledge ends , does God end , too ? Our brother tumbling from the bluff that night Into the gorge , but tumbled , as it were , Off of God 's fingers into his great palm . Ascent and descent are in one straight line . I see no angle in the universe , A break in things , a point where God begins And Satan ends . If , in this strange event , The people see a movement of the sky And stand amazed , I stand even more amazed At what I see than they at seraphim . For what I see is darkness giving light , An earth-born thing showing capacity For deeds divine , and busy in the dark Not with its own low nature but with God . I grapple with it and my light goes out . I feel as though I walked in a strong wind Along a reed , with only faith for eyes . Reason calls it to me with a blind man 's voice . That helplessness should bring an angel down , Is that as wonderful as that it should bring A devil up to do an angel 's work ? What we see , Louis , is the miracle . What they see , while it jars our sense of things , Falls nicely into the mental harmony .</p>

       <l>The Sages who , as gifts to Delphi , brought</l>
       <l>Small sheaves of wisdom , offering them to God</l>
       <l>As better gifts than first born bulls and goats .</l>

       <l>Its telamons should be those giant men</l>
       <l>Who propt the fabric of the ancient world .</l>
       <l>The east and west and north and south should lay</l>
       <l>Their four white corners on the four broad backs</l>
       <l>Of Plato and his solid pupil 's mind ,</l>
       <l>Then him who dove too deep for Rome to see ,</l>
       <l>Lucretius , maddening round the seeds of things ,</l>
       <l>And Cicero because he loved the truth .</l>

So it was the dwarf And not an angel saved your monk . And here You pass the deed off as a miracle To swell your abbey 's revenues and rob Me of the alms of my parishioners ? ” He sees me coming down the mountain side And shouts this at me , and I say to him —?</p>

      <p>urprised , amazed , you lift your hands : “ Mon Dieu ! A son of Satan save St. Giles ’ child ! Do devils , then , wait upon men of God Working salvation ? Do they ? If they do , What means this storm of banners in the dawn , This , ‘ Dieu le volt ! ’ and these bright harnassed knights Trampling the Orient into battle smoke ? Why this vast tumult in the dead sunrise ? If devils will take up arms and fight for God , Why roll these human surges down the East To smoke and break about the Sepulcher In hard white foam from which the ravens fly ? Let Hell lead forth her legions from the pit Impervious to drought and pain alike , To take and guard the Tomb . No , Father , no . ‘ Tis blasphemy , the unforgiven sin , To ascribe to Hell a deed that God hath done . ”</p>

It was the dwarf that threw the brother down . ” With words like these , chisels of policy , Upon the shield of each returning knight That hath spilt blood about the Sepulcher , We carve an angel that shall plead our cause Through all the fields and villages of France And far on into the North and — Ah , this train ! This train shall be the trumpet that shall blow Our miracle abroad through Italy , And Italy is the trumpet of the world . Talk to the strangers then of shooting stars , Of sounds of heavenly music in the night , But only when a question calls it forth . Climbing the tree gives flavor to the fruit . Be reticent ; that will add majesty . Appear subdued and point to yonder peaks Where , in the gray dawn , gleams of vanishing wings Shone on the mountain snows like molten gold . You understand ? About the witch 's son , Adeste cum silentio .<stage>After passing out through the gate , the Abbot turns and calls after Louis , who is crossing the court .</stage>Louis , No word as yet to Oswald of the dream .

      <p>hile he was hunting for it in his dream , Like a blind weasel for a nest of eggs , And had his hand on what felt like a skin , The matins rang . He 's been gruff ever since . There 's not a holy bell can call to prayer To smooth our spirits with the thought of God , But brings him from his hole with ruffled quills , Threatening the belfry with his palmer 's staff . He says he hopes the Devil has snared the train And spurred the asses off the bluffs to Hell .</p>

      <p>y , wolves of Hell . Hear what I say . Ah , Father , Father ! Sometimes we think our Lord is dead in heaven , His enemies so thrive upon the earth . We see the Devil 's squatters on our lands With deeds that seem to bear the seal of Heaven ; Yea , everything they do seems blest of Heaven . They plow and sow ; God gives them sun and rain . Their fields wave green ; the frosts are kept at bay . They build their barns ; Heaven holds her storms in leash And seems to slumber while the singing foe Silver their scythes beneath the harvest moon . But when the season plumps the golden ears And Satan brings his sacks to get the grain , God puts his sickle in and takes the crop .</p>

      <p>y , sends Benedict . When vines are bending and the song is heard Of Bacchus revelling in the bubbling must , The golden trumpets of the sun in heaven Proclaim a festival and wake the skies . Angels come tripping to the foaming vats And , while the devils tread the vintage out , Brim their bright casks with gushing purple meath To crown the crystal goblets of the saints , Leaving the pulp to slop the swine of Hell .</p>

       <l>Listen , Benedict .</l>
       <l>In an old abbey down in Italy</l>
       <l>There hangs an ancient chime of seven bells .</l>
       <l>Oft when a child I heard them in the dawn</l>
       <l>Singing like angels in the Apennines ,</l>
       <l>Their tones so blended , so harmoniously</l>
       <l>Tuned to the planets that , when twilight fell ,</l>
       <l>They were the echoes of the Pleiades .</l>
       <l>Those old , old bells ! I hear them still sometimes .</l>
       <l>We children called them by the golden names</l>
       <l>Archangels wear . Well , in a storm one night</l>
       <l>Raphael went down . Some say a huge black hand</l>
       <l>Strangled him in his tower and hurled him down .</l>
       <l>And others say — mark , Benedict — that God —</l>

      <p>hen follow the same path And you shall see your seraph of the night Bleed out his strength upon the spears of dawn . ‘ Twas thought that Raphael 's tumbling down the rocks Had wrecked his silver voice , and so he lay Three years half-sunken in a slimy marsh , His golden throat choked up with water-weeds And fetid lilies breathing of the swamp . ‘ Twas said that oft when morning woke the bells Upon the heights , a drowned voice was heard , A strangled booming in the marsh-fogs . Well . One Sabbath while the morning star still burned A lone white taper , on a sudden from his couch The ancient bellman started . The old chime Was singing in its tower , and , like a thrush That eyeless hath escaped a narrow cage , The voice of Raphael on his bough again Rang through the woods . The eagles on the crags Shook out their wings and circled in the sky ; The mountain shepherds shouted from the rocks , While down the ether , flaming out of the East , Melodious angels in the sun-burst sang .<stage>With his eyes burning and fixed upon the Priest .</stage>Now , Benedict , who lifted up that bell ?</p>

     <stage>For a moment they look into one another 's eyes , the Abbot with a penetrating glance , the Priest with a look of blank amazement .

     <stage>The monk , who a few yards back has been pacing to and fro in order to overhear the conversation , has stopped and stands observing them .

Reaching over the fence to the well he swings the bucket to his mouth .</stage>You know so many strange and evil things Have happened lately . Just a week ago Old mother Sar was palsied . Then young Foy , In the dead of night , saw witch-fire on the heath . Next day two cows , their udders drizzling blood , Ran snorting down the road into the wood , And all the village curs that ventured out Came yelping to their kennels cramped with fear As though the devils chased them .</p>

      <p>ndeed they did . And that 's not all . Thursday A black stone fell from heaven . Father said It was a challenge . And that very night Occurred a wonder during complines . Yes , The golden chalices in the church took fire And circled round the altar . Blood appeared On Father 's hands , and while all sat amazed , Looking to see him caught away to heaven , A snow-white dove flew through the trancept wall , The Holy Spirit , Father says . You know The canvass that they keep covering the cross That Oswald carves , round that it whisked and moaned , And Rachel says she heard the voice of Christ Under the canvass : “ It will not be done . ” Meaning the cross , I thought ; but Father says : “ Maybe it means God 's will will not be done , ” And so it proved . Disaster came at dawn . Pierre , the sacristan of good St. Giles , Brought the news down to Father Benedict . But you have heard of the great miracle ? No ? And all the world has heard of it ?</p>

      <p>h , angels have fluttered down on us since then ! And will again , so Father says . La me ! I tell you , Madam Valmy , if any grave In the churchyard there had jumped a horrid ghost To stalk the moonlight in a rotten shroud , There 'd be less stir among the village folk . I know not how it was .

      <p>here is a glory far off in the air . Father has seen it and his eyes are bright . So bright . Rachel will tell you . Or it may be He sees the pilgrims that shall gather here . This morning Marie heard two brothers say There 's sure to be a shrine where Oswald fell . Think of it , Madam Valmy , these streets thronged With holy men that live beyond the sea . I never even thought to pray for that . God does all things so easily , though . And — And all for his dear sake . But I do n't know . The Scriptures say Satan shall be let loose .</p>

      <p>ou think he will ? Oh , do you , Madam Valmy ? Do you , indeed ? Oh , think of what that means To little Oswald here ! To wear a name A blessed saint hath worn and given him With his own lips at the baptismal font ; To see a white hand beckon from the sky And hear forever in each vesper chime A saint 's clear voice calling his soul to come And flower out beneath the holy bells . Oh , think , Fidele , some day when he is old And in his cloister yonder on the mountain , When the dear brothers gathered after prayer Shall talk of holy things , and one shall say : “ My father fought with Montfort in the wars ” ; Another : “ I have seen St. Bavon 's tree ” ; And some old palmer who hath seen all shrines Shall tell of Subiaco and the thorns Of good St. Benedict , my boy can say : “ I grew to manhood in the little town Down in the valley . I have never been Beyond the mountains , but each day have heard , Morning and night , St. Giles ’ dewy bells Ring from these towers the twilight hour of prayer , Yet was I favored . When they christened me ” — Oh , I can see them wonder at him then , And press about him .— “ When they christened me St. Oswald stood god-father at the font And blessed me with his hands upon my head , Blessed me and said : ‘ The Virgin keep this child . ’ A neighbor said his face shone like a star , He was so full of glory . And the night , The night the angels brought him from the gorge And laid him here before the abbey gate , He wore the holy hood my mother made . They keep it yet inside the sacred chest , There in the chapel . ”<stage>Faint shouts far to the left .</stage>I am so afraid Jules will go with them .

      <stage>feet back from the street . Low stone fences on either side project in to its corners and form with its front three sides of a hexagon . To the right , in a higher fence , also of stone , which runs parallel with the street , is an iron gate , overgrown with vines , leading into the churchyard . Between the palings can be seen white crosses marking the graves . In the corners , just where the fences start in toward the church , stand Lombardy poplars in full foliage , one on either side . The church is built of rough stone , with irregular seams of white mortar . In the center is an arched doorway and beside it two false windows almost covered with ivy . High up over the door is seen the lower part of a narrow louvre window with several long straws , which the birds have carried there , hanging down from between the slats .</stage>
      <stage>In the open space before the church , a crowd is gathered . Upon the steps with his back to the door stands Jardin , the Bailiff . He wears a sleeveless hauberk wrought of chain , and upon his head a heavy open helmet . Some distance to the right , upon a step lower down , Jacques Sar , wearing a leather corselet and a cap of wolf skin , is leaning with his right hand against the church . His right arm is off near the shoulder . The crowd is made up of men , for the most part in their working clothes . Some have no hats on . Among the latter is Hugh Capet , whose red head is seen far in near the steps . Jules Bacqueur , with his sleeves rolled up , stands on the edge of the crowd . Out in the street to the left , is a group of women . A boy is up in the poplar tree , right .</stage>

      <p>as Jardin right last week when comrade 's wife<stage>With a motion toward old Jacques .</stage>Fell palsied and he said : “ Let 's kill the witch ; Next thing she 'll strike some brother . ” Was he right ? Was he ? In here is a cross can tell you . Is the cross done ? Can any man say why ? The holy monk that carves it , where is he ? Up yonder on the mountain in his cell , Nigh unto death . Only the Virgin 's hands That plucked him from the pit can save his life . And who 's to blame ? Who is to blame , men ? Eh ? You men that shout to sail out to the East And swell about the neck as vipers do , Blowing against the Moslems , what do you say To the heathen on the mountain up there , eh ? Twenty moons and more have risen and set Since they took up their station ‘ neath the stars And , in collusion with the hag of hell , Shook pestilence and death upon the air . Planets have knocked and fire has fallen and blood Has drizzled over all this region . Eh ? What do you think our Lord thinks of these things ? Rescue the mountains ; they are His Sepulcher . You want to see Golgotha ? There it is . A mountain with a heretic on its peak Is like a spear thrusting a bitter sop Up to our Lord 's lips even in heaven . You men Who see the sop and leave it there are Jews .</p>

Lightning splintered blue About them , smells of sulphur rose , and thunder Clapped the dark rock . The mountain shook . Straightway , Cries of the men rang out . The leaders crashed , Dumb-smitted with horror , mules and packs and all , Down through the chaparral to the gowle below . The witches vanished . All the Pass was still Save through the night the golden chalices Clinking far down the scaur . Then on a sudden<stage>Rosa , excited , runs in , right , and hurries to the women .</stage>The grisly hags , crooning a wild song , rose Tossing the golden cups up in the air , And like a strip of mist went down the wind Toward Pampeluna .

      <p>s that the way you fowlers take your birds , Rush out and throw the net before their eyes ? Is it ? And when the wolves prowl for your lambs , You raise a shout before you stretch the string , Do you ? Here 's Jacques . You think he 'd have this cap If he had yelled to the brute , “ Watch for your skin , ” And rushed on him waving a club ? Do you ? Eh ? If you do , I tell you Jardin do n't ; ‘ N I reckon Jardin 's seen a wolf or two . This dwarf of Hulga 's , you do n't think he 's sly , Do you ? Eh ? Well , he is , sly as a newt . You touch the stones once and you 'll see him gone . What 's to be done , then ? Listen to Jardin : Deploy . You do n't know what that means , do you ? Some of you here are burning for the East To fight the Moslems . Just cry : “ Allah-ho ! ” And then rush on them , will you ? Turks , ai n't they ?</p>

Three of you fellows Skirt the ford yonder and shut off retreat To the cave . There 's one claw open . Halt , men . Then two detachments — Here , attention , men ; Wait for your orders .— Then two squads of three March up that way —<stage>He points left .</stage>and when you strike the hedge , Right ! left ! one along the wold ; the other Down through the waddy ; each to the river . Then we 've got him flanked . There 's three claws open And the bird is ours . Now listen . Listen men . You men that mean to cut off his retreat , Take spears . He 'll squawk we pinch him , and the old hen , Hearing her chick , will swoop down from the rocks . Then 's your chance ; stick her .</p>

      <p>ow hear what Jardin says . If he could ask , For what he suffered in the Holy Wars , Two gifts of Heaven , and two strong saints should soar Past the green steeples of these poplars here And fold their white wings in that street and say : “ Soldier , what are they ? ” What would Jardin say ? First this :<stage>He steps back upon the steps .</stage>Up yonder is a holy monk Whom God has blessed above all living men . Abaddon hurled him down to take his life . He 's bruised almost to death . Saints , bring him down . We 're going to kindle such a fire here As friends of darkness , glowering from the caves , Shall see and then scoot shuddering to Hell .<stage>The crowd shouts .</stage>Bring him down , then , and let him see the flames Lick up the limbs that tripped him .</p>

      <p>ere , men , put on those caps . You think you 're saints ? If you can fly through air , why bring him down ; You can n't , then hush and hear what Jardin says . First then I 'd say : “ Bring down the monk . ” Then this : There 's a big fellow on the mountain tops What calls Thor Father , spitting at our Lord . And in the dawn when Christians gather here To holy mass he stands upon the peaks And scowls upon the bells . He and the witch Are brain and bowels to some heathen god Whose dark hand works at night beneath the hills Sapping the towers of Christ . Saints , send him down . Tell him to strap his big old martel on him . He comes down here he 'll feel a damaskin That 's sliced the Turks and choked the gates of hell With ghosts of Allah , and another 'll go Bloody and hot to Thor .<stage>Shouts .</stage>Send him down , saints . Some one here says , “ If Canzler comes , what then ? ” He 'll die . Who 'll do it ? Listen : Jardin will .<stage>He comes down into the crowd that surges and clamors about him .</stage>Line up !<stage>He chooses nine men , whom he arranges in squads of three .</stage>A MAN —<stage>In the first squad .</stage>About those spears .</p>

       <l>— these men aghast here</l>

       <l>When we were storming Acre . The Infidel ,</l>
       <l>Sallying out , had laid the Lion Heart</l>
       <l>Low in the dust . The waves of battle clapped</l>
       <l>Over his head . Barred in with dripping spears</l>
       <l>Of Turk and Christian , raged the bleeding whelp ,</l>
       <l>His paws red-clotted in his own hot blood .</l>
       <l>Cleaving the gloom , a burst of crimson light</l>
       <l>Streamed down the slanting spears and like a prow</l>
       <l>Rolled back the waves of war . Between the crests</l>
       <l>Of foam-white faces holy St. Augustine</l>
       <l>Came walking down the bodies of the dead ,</l>
       <l>And lifting the Lion , fired him . At once</l>
       <l>Rose on the night the planet of his shield</l>
       <l>Burning a lane before his falchion fed ,</l>
       <l>And down the slope into the Turks he swept</l>
       <l>Through dropping shields and sabers thrown in air ,</l>
       <l>A lurid streak of flame . So Jardin now ,</l>
       <l>Seeing this blessed monk the saints have brought ,</l>
       <l>Takes fire , and blown with hate of our Lord 's foes ,</l>
       <l>Will lick the crags and leap from peak to peak ,</l>
       <l>Nor shall the flame go out until the wind</l>
       <l>Rain heathen ashes on the pit of hell .</l>

As I came down I passed the jagged cliff You tumbled over , and there a while I paused Entranced , as it were , by unseen Presences .<stage>The boy , who climbed down from the tree upon the arrival of the Priest , leads the ass out , left .</stage>The mountains wore a new and hallowed look In the morning light . I would give half my life To have stood upon the peaks that night and seen God 's ministers drop shining down the sky And blaze the gorge . But God works in the dark . At night His golden ladders are let down And deeds are done and no man knoweth how . At dawn we see the severed hills , the seas Huddled aghast at some vast mountain head That yesterday lay fathoms in the deep . So quietly He worketh in the night That mountain ranges rise and no babe wakes . Who can say : “ Yonder God is ” ?</p>

      <p>one . The hand that executes His purposes Is hidden like the purposes themselves . He dwelleth in the storm and in the calm , Yet both look round and say : “ Where dwelleth He ? ” The sun that shines on all , shines not on Him . He goeth forth at night and doth His will , Yet the moon sees Him not . I rode along Thinking upon your providential Escape from death that night and of the work God hath reserved for me in the great chase , For half the glory is mine . I prayed our Lord That if it be His will I might catch some Glimpse of the dogs far off . I could not see My hand before my eyes in spirit , but With eyelids down , rode on , probing the dark , Sounding deep in my soul the ocean of God , And finding there bottomless waters . The night of ebony and the golden dawn , The deed the past holds and the future 's deed , Rose half way up the sky and called across Fathomless spaces : “ Who are you ? ” And I Thought answer : “ Thou art Fall ; and thou , with hair Bright with the morning and with frightened eyes Fleeing the noise of dogs behind thee , thou Art Resurrection and the Peace of God . ” Connection I could find none . Stark and lone They stood upon the twilight fields of air , Strangers , each looking in the face of each , When through the gloaming came a glittering link Star-like with the image of our Lord Bleeding in silver on a silver cross , A marriage ring that married them , and I Deep in my soul knew the Eternal and Saw Prophesy grappling the North and heard Heathendom hiss and coil and loose her folds ; And then a voice filling the heavens : “ Well done . ” Speaking to me , for the glory is mine . Your crucifix has not been found yet ?</p>

       <l>Jardin was pacing watch . Through the darkness ,</l>
       <l>Pierced by the burial torches of the Turks ,</l>
       <l>A smoke-thin shadow passed across the plain</l>
       <l>Between the armies , blotting one by one</l>
       <l>The drifting death-fires of old Saladin .</l>

       <l>Half eaten by hunger , in a fever trance</l>

       <l>Did Jardin say , Because the Turk 's a boy</l>
       <l>I 'll spare him ? Did Jardin give him dates ? No .</l>
       <l>He 'd made a vow never to spare no foe</l>
       <l>Of Mary 's Son , so , like a starving hound ,</l>

      <stage>the village . On the right , is a wagon bridge built of logs . Some slabs , left over from the building of the bridge years ago , lie in a pile at the roadside . Farther back , across the river the course of which is marked by a line of sycamores , the mountain rises abrupt and green , with here and there patches of bare rocks and trees thickening as it extends back and up . Away to the center and left , a stretch of bottom land with cultivated fields . One gets a nearer view of the snow-capped peaks seen from the mountain side in the first Scene and from the courtyard of the abbey in the second . In the foreground at the roadside , is a large olive tree with its dark shadow lying directly beneath it , for over the landscape is a clear light as of a noonday sun shining from a cloudless sky .</stage>
      <stage>Under the tree , with several willow baskets strung together lying upon the ground beside him , sits the dwarf , Sigurd , polishing Oswald 's silver crucifix upon his knee . He holds it out in a bit of sunshine that falls through the leaves and , after flashing the light about , resumes rubbing it upon his trousers .</stage>

The latter staggers back , his astonishment that steel armor should be pierced by mortal sword giving way to a look of chagrin , and after endeavoring to steady himself with the blade of his sword , falls flat , his armor clanking on the road . The villagers drop their stones and flee terror-stricken . Canzler stands for a moment , wipes the perspiration from his brow , then reaches down and takes up the Bailiff 's sword by the point .</stage>

     <stage>He takes the boy by the hand and they return across the bridge . The Bailiff stirs , lifts himself to his elbow , and stretches his hand toward the crucifix . He cannot reach it and falls back and lies still .</stage>

      <p>he 's scared herself at the pesky thing . Often as here by the coals she 's sat Crunching her pignuts and stroking her cat , Many a time I 've heard her say That Thor 's arm shriveled that April day When out of a cloud in a thunder shower He threw his bolt at the tall gray tower . It shivered a poplar tree near by . The church stood sound with its cursed crest , While the god went bellowing down the sky , Clutching his shoulder in terrible pain . Now he rides to the east and he rides to the west — So Granny says — and he 's never seen Lashing his goats through the driving rain . Dark and fireless the clouds drift round ; Their waters fall without any sound . It 's Hoder that drives them now , I ween .</p>

      <p>he fairies too are bolder now . Every hour you can hear them call From forest and bracken and water-fall . Even at midday , when I 've been clearing Ore from the mountains and stood a peering Through cracks in the cliff , I have seen them at play Catching the drops of silvery spray , Running with emeralds and amethysts To the stones where the purple iris rests . With hands to their mouths , from the mossy ledge , They boom to the bittern far down in the sedge On the river bank . They are in the air . Woodland and water — everywhere .</p>

      <p>nd well it might be , if this tale is true . Sleeping he lay on the ground one night — He had guzzled his fill of Granny 's brew — When , thinking he heard his bellows blow , He opened his eyes and spied the glow Of flames on his forge , the sparks a leaping , And a score of elves — - they thought him sleeping — On trough and anvil and on the ground Clapping their hands as they fell around . Then he stirred , when lo ! there was not a spark ; The bellows was still , the stithy was dark .</p>

      <p><stage>Rising quickly to a sitting posture .</stage>The tale is as true as the master 's steel . Here on the stones I lay that night , Curled like a cat in the fire-light , While there by the wall with a whirring sound Granny 's old spinning wheel went round . It whirred and it whirred so I could not sleep , So I lay and yawned and began to peep And nudge the fire , for the night was cool . Around the big wheel the wether 's wool Ran black , the dame 's foot under her skirt Paddling the pedal for Sigurd 's shirt . The wheel stopped a moment , and during the hush I had dropped to a doze , when there came a rush Of the coldest air that ever warped skin , And Loki , frightened , dashed up and in From the rift in the rocks .<stage>He rises to one knee .</stage>His face was white And the smut upon it showed black as night And his limbs were so weak that he almost fell . When he got his breath he began to tell How , roused from his sleep by a noise in his shop — Then Granny spied me and nudged him to stop , And the two went out . I leaped to the ledge And peered through the crack . Far up on the edge Of the cliff where the hazel bushes grow , The pines were glossing ; the gnomes , I trow , Were choking the caves to get in the ground And hide in the dark lest they should be found When Balder should roll his bright wheel on high . Already his lances waved in the sky Bedabbled with blood . The heavens were pale And the peaks were bright with his burning mail . I lost not a trice . As quick as a wink I rushed to the roots and out through the chink With the Devil 's herb I followed the pair . Darting invisible through the air , I squatted toad-like on the turf and heard Them babble their plans , heard every word , Heard Granny wheeze and the master say — As they rose from the rock and turned away — “ We must nag on the gnomes or the cross will rise . They must take the monk 's life or put out his — ”</p>

     <head type="scene">SCENE TWO — The scriptorium in the dormitory of the abbey .</head>
     <stage type="setting">
      <stage>The walls are of stone . In the left wall , near the corner , a door opens into a hall that leads thence to the courtyard . Near it , forward , an enormous chest with metal trimmings and handles of embossed stags ’ heads , the antlers gradually disappearing into the panel . Upon the chest , as though thrown there carelessly , lies a heavy cloak . About ten feet from the door , against the rear wall , stands a small priedieu covered with a rich altar-cloth interwoven with the figure — seen in old arras — of St. Giles sitting upon a rock with the deer resting its head in his lap . Behind the deer is a clump of brambles . The kneeling piece , which projects from under the folds of the altar-cloth , is of dark wood highly polished . Upon it is a scarlet cushion . A little above the priedieu , in a semicircular niche in the wall , is set a bronze crucifix some ten inches in height . Before it burns a small taper . Farther to the right , a second door leading into a corridor which connects with the sleeping apartments . Between this door and the priedieu are shelves filled with books and old manuscripts . Beyond the door , which swings in and is partly open , an old buckler hangs upon the wall , and beneath it , upon two iron spikes , a long spear . Between the spear and buckler is fixed a parchment cut mitriform and bearing in large illumined letters the inscriptions HUGH DE BUILLON CUM DEO ET CUM GODEFRIDO NICAEIS ANTIOCHIIS HIEROSOLYMIS MIL NONAG SEPT OCT NOV . Farther to the right , in the corner , a Saracen coat-of-mail filled with spears which , converging center and spread out above and below , look like a sheaf of steel . Across the breast of the coat-of-mail is a strip of parchment with the inscription illumined as before : A MOHAMED FILIO SATAN CHRISTO FILIO DEI . In the right wall are apertures of two deep-set windows , near which are three carrels , each with an old manuscript spread out upon it and ink-pots and other copying and illuminating materials . Hanging beside them are finger rags smeared with various colored stains . On one of the carrels lies a sprig of flowering mountain laurel . Near the center of the room , a few feet to the right , stands a long table running parallel with the side walls . It is overstrewn with old manuscripts , some of them discolored and half unrolled ; others , near the forward end , piled in the form of a miniature pyramid . Farther back , a small brass lamp , pitcher-shaped and with a wick protruding from its spout , burns with a yellow flame . The room is but dimly lighted , as a large room would be , with a single lamp burning upon the table and a little taper winking in the niche in the wall .</stage>
      <stage>To the right of the table , in a square , high-backed chair with animal-feet , sits the Abbot in a black gown , bareheaded . His feet , which are under the table , are cased in slippers of sheep-skin with the white fleece still upon it . From his right hand , which hangs beside his chair , a scroll of parchment trails upon the floor . Farther back , upon the opposite side of the table , stands the Priest , his left hand resting upon the back of a chair the front legs of which are raised a few inches from the floor . At the further end of the table Oswald is standing with his finger wiping away the tears that trinkle down his cheeks .</stage>
      <stage>Thunder is heard intermittently , and from time to time the windows are shaken by the violence of the wind .</stage>

      <p>o n't say that . You will be well again . You will be strong Some day , my son , and many years shall pass Ere the Lord calls you . Hath he not given proof ? A shepherd to you , surely God hath been . Three nights ago at this time , where were you ? Lying down in the gorge , and the night wind Passed and you knew it not . But God watched there , And sent his servant — for all things serve Him — And here you are safe in the fold again . That deed unclasped a volume of bright days . God doth not put his hand forth and lift up As he hath lifted you , and then cast down Ere the knees be straightened . Your tears should fall For joy , my son , not sorrow . Think how near Your foot was to the gates of darkness when God turned your face around and there flashed out A jeweled finger pointing toward a dawn — Far off it may be or it may be near — When the last shred of darkness shall vanish . Let those that hound you , fear , for God shall cleave A chasm in the earth for them ; but you — No , no , my son , not darkness , light . God 's light And glory from the new Jerusalem Will shine upon you on the mountain tops , If dreams are tapers lighting what is to be , As some believe they are .<stage>The Priest reaches under his gown and takes something in his right hand , and with the other draws the string from around his neck and drops it into his right hand , after which he pulls the sleeve down over it till only the knuckles are visible .</stage>Therefore , my son , Lift up your face and let white words go forth And usher in the Sabbath . Truth in the heart Is fire under water , but on the lips It lighteth every man the Way of Life .<stage>The Priest goes toward the chest near the door .</stage>Benedict , will you do as Pilate did ?</p>

Or let the infant Sabbath , born this hour , Put not a foot on earth , but like a bird Wander upon the winds , and in the dark Grope for the morning star and find it not . Let the gates of the morning be shut and let no bell Wake up the world , unless it wake to see Death ravining on the mountains and white Faith Painting her banners there in heathen blood .

      <p>ou , Benedict , not I , are needing grace . You have assailed a child of God , and you Know what our Lord said : “ ‘ Twere better a mill-stone Were hanged about his neck and he were flung Into the sea , than offend one of these . ” You even seemed to take delight , to relish Harrowing his soul up with the hunter 's dream And breaching it for horror to peep through .</p>

      <stage>with deep , wide eaves overhanging the street , stand in a dark mass . To the left , a little way from the others and back a few paces from the street , is a small house , the home of Jardin . Through a window in the room on the right side comes a faint light as from a low-burning lamp . To the left of the window , one feels that there is a door , though , either on account of intervening bushes or perhaps because of a porch that makes it darker there , one does not see it . Out in the yard where the light from the window falls upon the bushes near the casement , the glistening of the leaves shows that it has been raining . The windows of the other houses , like vacant eyes under deep brows , are dark , and there are no signs of life anywhere . Over the roofs and through the great trees that rise up behind them flows a greyness that emphasizes the quiet of the hour . About the street lie several limbs that were broken off by the storm during the night .</stage>

      <p>he soldier had a bad night . In his fever He picks the sheets , mumbling : “ Saints , send him down , ” And : “ Listen , men ! ” and things like that . And once , Jumps him clean out of bed and cries out : “ There ! ” As he had run the woodman through and through , And wipes his sword like on his pants , and then , As though he felt his wound , falls back and pop ! The wind or something blows the light out and We hear the banshee singing in the storm , Wild — wild . I fear the bell with toll ‘ fore night .</p>

The gate into the church yard is slightly ajar , as though some one had lately passed through , and against the dark grass the taller of the white grave markers lean as though the wind had been among them . Over the low fences where one looks back into the church yard on the one side and into an open space on the other , is seen yellow light from the side windows of the church , pouring out into the gloom .

Blind Samson 's head , who pulled the pillars down , Under a dog 's paws in the Gaza streets . And in his car , as a salutation for the Sabbath , Bark this from Benedict , from Benedict , the dog : “ Pride is a wind that from the shores of light Bloweth far off where neither sun nor moon Nor stars shine nor shall shine forevermore . ” God hath heard one prayer .

      <p><stage>Alone upon the steps .</stage>This is the day .<stage>A pause .</stage>Inscrutable are the ways of God . Dark , dark , Unfathomable the sea in which He moves . He changeth as the waters change , and yet The mountains strike their roots in Him and stand .<stage>Thunder right . The priest comes down from the steps and out into the street , where he stands looking up at the sky .</stage>Thy ways are not our ways . Thy voice is heard Abroad upon the firmament . The stars That should have been put out an hour ago Burn bright upon the edges of the storm . Satan hath laid his hand upon the sun , And the day gropes , feeling her way far off As doth the blind . But yesterday the morn Walked beautiful on the mountains , with her lamp Kindled as for the Resurrection . This is the Sabbath , yet Golgotha 's gloom Hangs o'er the Sepulcher , and like a torch Thrown down upon the mountains burns the dawn A scant blue flame far down behind the world .<stage>A pause .</stage>God shall not call in vain .<stage>Looking left .</stage>I will forgive The bitter words . The lost shall be reclaimed .</p>

      <p>ierre , in the name of God , all-hail ! I greet you as one having holy lips , Since God hath chosen you to set on fire With one bright word all days to be . Pierre , Which way hath he gone ? God is waiting . The seraphim — Nay , fear me not , for I Have been baptized with fire that hath fallen Suddenly from heaven . Which way hath he gone ? To the high places fly the seraphim And banners flash and fade among the clouds . The Lord of Life into my power hath given The life of him who spoke — I will forgive The bitter words . This is the day of days . Within I shine , though round about the storm Spreadeth her gloom . Even my hands are dark . The thunder peals the muster of the dead .</p>

      <p>ay , Pierre , these are shouts of them whose mouths Shall sing upon the mountains when my hand Shall rend the hound and pluck the blind from death . His breath is in the hollow of my hand , And though he taunted me and though I might —<stage>He blows in his palm .</stage>The dream shall be fulfilled . Throughout all time All dreams shall hail this dream a holy thing That hath chosen from all days this holy day To wake and run . While from the Sepulcher God rolls the stone back , the dream opens hell And slips the dogs while angels have the world . Henceforth the Angel of the Resurrection , Hand in hand with the hunter 's dream , shall run With fiery feet over the ages leaving Luminous the eyes of holy men . For me this is a great day . From the clouds The purposes of God , in fold on fold , Fall round and mantle me with light . Pierre , In what dread shape came Blindness through the halls Of the abbey , feeling for the brother 's eyes In the darkness ? What did he say when God With one blow blotted out the moon and sun Forever , and the faces of his friends ? Forgiveness did he cry for , for the things — But that is past . I have been and shall be , Yesterday and to-morrow , Benedict . To-day , as nameless as the stars of heaven , Forgetful of all injuries like the winds , I rush about the earth and , like the lightning , Will strike where God shall throw me . Like the rain , I shall fall mercifully on hot eyes that lit But a few hours before with pride and scorn But now are dark forever .</p>

      <p>will not say that . God in his power can make The blind earth fill the sockets of the blind With balls as bright as orbs of seraphim , Or without eyes can fill the soul with light . Your brother , Pierre , fell upon the dark — My brother ; I will say it and forgive — Our brother fell on darkness not last night , But long since turned his shining face away From light , and gradually as the sun Sinks , sank low down where sun and moon and stars Say , “ Vanity ! ” and the grave is over all .<stage>The sobbing of Pierre is heard .</stage>But he shall rise . I thank God for this power . It shall be to my glory that for hate I returned love . Vengeance is His , and I Simply a wind to blow and do His will . God shall have praise , but I shall have praise , too . Names shall be written high and lamps shall burn Under them , so that all the saints may see .<stage>He comes out in the street and stands looking in the direction in which the men went , talking to himself .</stage>Then some who with high heads walked this low earth — ‘ Tis not my prayer , but if God so decide — What a day will bring forth no man can —<stage>Turning back .</stage>Pierre , Did he speak of me when the blow fell ? Did he say , “ I wronged that holy man ” ? Did he say that ? With what word bade he farewell to the stars ? Did not remorse — Why do you look at me With eyes of horror ?</p>

We see not clearly , for the light Blinds as the darkness doth . All night the earth Tumbled as a man in fever . Saints on fire Walked grandly on the mountain combs and called , And the graves opened , and the silent ones — What can it mean that of the churchyard dead Only the soldiers rose ? And that , too , when Hell 's hand was heavy on the brother ? Men , At midnight riding down the mountain , I Saw wonders and heard things I dare not tell . What the hounds are I know not , but I know One up there hath a snare laid for them . And I — I see my name in fire on those clouds . These winds shall blow it luminous , and all The world shall see it , and all time . Then some Who now accuse me will come round with smiles . For I will not be terrified by him .<stage>He says something under his breath and comes quickly down the steps and out into the street where he shouts after Pierre .</stage>Tell the old man I go upon this chase Out of no love for him or for his monk . For I despise them both . You Tell him just what I say and why I go . Tell him the storm hath spoken to me . Say I saw a hand of fire in the night Beckon , and heard a trumpet peal in heaven . He thinks I am a coward . So I am ; I fear to disobey the voice of God , And therefore go . Listen to me , Pierre ! You tell him this : Had Heaven not delivered Its orders to me , by the throne of God , Not a spear — Hear me ?— not a single spear Should redden in the rescue of this monk . As for his charge that I have done this deed , Tell him it smells of Hell .<stage>Thunder right .

For adulation maketh pride to swell And man becomes an idol .<stage>Looking up .</stage>Years ago A prophesy went sounding down the south That sent a thrill through Christendom . From Rome The echo came to us . The rumor ran That in the Saxon forest lived a boy Through whom the North should come contrite to God : A shepherd as was Moses and therefore Prepared to lead his people . Friar Paul Was sent to flash the light upon his way And win him unto Christ , to make his staff Put forth green Christian buds . With what result I need not tell you . Few , few men can bear Honor and the favor of the Most High . He , Moses himself could not . “ Watch Moses now ; ” And struck the rock . And then God : “ Now watch Me ; ” And gave his staff to Joshua . And here I find a lesson , this : Glory shall pass From the proud man to the humble man . To-day I take that prophesy up in my hands And with it seek the mountains of our God , And Heathendom shall fall like Jerich —</p>

      <p>et there be No shouting or any noise . Let us go Quietly as befits the Sabbath day . The vales blow white . Yonder the mountains stand Like quiet altars waiting sacrifice . You , with the holy banner of God , stand here . Now if there be among you one who hath Guilt , looking upon this storm let him step Out , lay his spear down and stay here and not Tempt the wrath of God . For soon upon the heights The heavens shall blacken and there shall be a loud Burst of His power and the shining glory of God . I pause a moment . Let that man step out Now .<stage>A pause .</stage>Then you have naught to fear . The innocent Are safe . God 's shield is over them . Come .</p>

     <stage>They go out silent . The scene has become darker and the wind is heard whistling among the white crosses in the churchyard . Back in the church through the open door is seen the beautifully carven Christ with overhead in golden letters the inscription : FORGIVE THEM FOR THEY KNOW NOT WHAT THEY —. The DO has never been put on .</stage>

   <div type="act" n="3">
    <head type="act">third Act . There is heard a steady roar as of wind over</head>
    <stage>vast forests , and all about are signs of an approaching storm . At intervals an unnatural , ghastly light as from rifted clouds swiftly driving overhead passes across the scene . In a moment the gloom has returned and the trees are racing back into the shadow .</stage>
    <stage>Back upon the ledge , his long yellow hair tossing in the wind , stands Rudolph watching the gathering of the storm .</stage>
    <stage>RUDOLPH — ( To himself . ) Flying on starless wings the Powers of night Keep back the bird of morning till the Norns Have traced the lines of guilt and set the snare .</stage>
    <stage>( A moment later Canzler appears coming down the sheep-path . )</stage>
    <stage>CANZLER — What was that shouting down the mountain for ?</stage>
    <stage>RUDOLPH — ( Turning quickly . ) The whirling of the wheel !</stage>
    <stage>CANZLER — The wheel ?</stage>
    <stage>RUDOLPH — ( Hurrying forward . ) Look there Where the vast felly flies ! Far out it swings And sways the forests . Look at it , Canzler ! For miles around below the mountain heads The storm goes racing in a wheel whose hub Turns on the village spire .</stage>
    <stage>( Canzler follows him back along the ledge . )</stage>
    <stage>Awhile ago , Divinely guided through the mountain ways , A common cloud , afloat upon the dark , Blotted the stars that glimmered in the tarn And whirled into a wheel . Around the rim Flows the white cloud-wool , and a thread is drawn Under the hills . The distaffs of the Norns Grow big with fate , and , sitting there in silence , Their withered fingers from this flying skein Loop off the lives of men . Val-father takes In his almighty hand the reins of things And drives them either way through earth and air .</stage>
    <stage>( Shouting far down the mountain . )</stage>
    <stage>CANZLER — I heard that far up on the mountain tops .</stage>
    <stage>RUDOLPH — In some procession honoring their god .</stage>
    <stage>CANZLER — But louder now .</stage>
    <stage>RUDOLPH — And nearer .</stage>
    <stage>CANZLER — Where is Fritz ?</stage>
    <stage>RUDOLPH — Rounding the sheep up . ( Shouting again . ) They have crossed the bridge .</stage>
    <stage>CANZLER — ( Turning and looking at Rudolph . ) Honoring their god upon the mountain side ?</stage>
    <stage>RUDOLPH — ‘ Tis the great dragon crawling through the hills .</stage>
    <stage>CANZLER — No wonder darkness fills the valley .</stage>
    <stage>( After a pause . )</stage>
    <stage>And in a storm like this !</stage>
    <stage>RUDOLPH — Hunger .</stage>
    <stage>CANZLER — No doubt . And there is hunger in the heavens , too .</stage>
    <stage>RUDOLPH — And the two face . ( They listen . ) The Asas all night long Were loud above the mountains as though some Vast purpose long pent up were finding way .</stage>
    <stage>CANZLER — And Selma heard it like a river flow Washing the peaks and down the wooded slopes Into the valley where the dragon lies .</stage>
    <stage>( Shouts still afar but growing nearer . )</stage>
    <stage>That belly levels all things in the plain . ( Thunder . )</stage>
    <stage>RUDOLPH — Val-father 's voice from out the clouds mid-air Meets with the dragon 's voice and devours it . Hark !</stage>
    <stage>CANZLER — It may lay hands on Fritz .</stage>
    <stage>( He goes back along the ledge and starts down the mountain . )</stage>
    <stage>RUDOLPH — Be careful , chief ! The wheel moves this way .</stage>
    <stage>CANZLER — It is following them .</stage>
    <stage>RUDOLPH — Here he comes running up the mountain !</stage>
    <stage>CANZLER — Where ?</stage>
    <stage>RUDOLPH — Wait till the lightning shows the slopes again .</stage>
    <stage>( They listen . The shouts draw nearer . )</stage>
    <stage>CANZLER — The Bailiff 's blood has roused them .</stage>
    <stage>RUDOLPH — With that blood Val-father has enticed it from its lair To tempt the mountains and to seek for more .</stage>
    <stage>( Lightning . )</stage>
    <stage>Up here ! Coming up here !</stage>
    <stage>CANZLER — ( Shouting . ) Fritz !</stage>
    <stage>RUDOLPH — The dark bloom , Whose scattered roots the years have fed , at last Unfolds its petals to the sun . The North In all her graves is waiting for the dawn . To-day Val-father lays his shadow by .</stage>
    <stage>CANZLER — Go up the rocks and blow the battle horn .</stage>
    <stage>( Rudolph goes leaping up the rocks . )</stage>
    <stage>And let the battle cry be “ Dachtelfeld ” !</stage>
    <stage>RUDOLPH — The peaks are tipped with day !</stage>
    <stage>( He disappears up the rocks . )</stage>
    <stage>VOICE OF SELMA — ( Above . ) Where are you , Father ?</stage>
    <stage>( Lightning . )</stage>
    <stage>CANZLER — Stay from the timber ! Do n't get near the trees !</stage>
    <stage>( Thunder . )</stage>
    <stage>Stay in the open , Selma !</stage>
    <stage>( The form of Canzler , who stands back upon the ledge , disappears in the gathering gloom . )</stage>
    <stage>VOICE OF SELMA — Father !</stage>
    <stage>VOICE OF FRITZ — ( Down the mountain . ) Chief !</stage>
    <stage>( There is heard , at first scarcely audible but rising more and more , low music as of spirit voices . Above , just where the sheep-path enters the bushes , Selma appears coming hurriedly down . Hearing the music , she stops and , listening , becomes as one entranced . )</stage>
    <stage>SELMA — ( Almost in a whisper . ) Father !</stage>
    <stage>( Canzler comes forward into view . The girl , still transported and more like a being of the air , has come further down the path . )</stage>
    <stage>Oh , hear them !</stage>
    <stage>CANZLER — Go back , go back , child ! They shall not harm you . ( She rushes to him . ) They will not come up here .</stage>
    <stage>( The girl lays her hand on his arm . They listen . )</stage>
    <stage>Only Val-father 's voice along the storm .</stage>
    <stage>VOICE OF FRITZ — Chief !</stage>
    <stage>CANZLER — It is Fritz .</stage>
    <stage>SELMA — -  The trees — the trees are singing . The wild vines and the mountain flowers — Oh ! O Father , see !</stage>
    <stage>CANZLER — What ails you , child ?</stage>
    <stage>SELMA — The elves — the storm elves gather in the air , And up the mountain there — Hear them , Father ! Hear the fairies calling ! Oh , the white flakes ! The dog-wood blooms are falling !</stage>
    <stage>( She runs wildly up the path . )</stage>
    <stage>He 's coming , Father ! Oswald 's coming !</stage>
    <stage>( She disappears among the bushes . In the rear Fritz is seen climbing up the mountain . )</stage>
    <stage>FRITZ — ( Who goes leaping on up the rocks . ) Chief !</stage>
    <stage>CANZLER — Here I am .</stage>
    <stage>( Fritz leaps back down to the ledge and comes hurrying forward . )</stage>
    <stage>FRITZ — ( Out of breath . ) They 've killed — they 've killed the sheep ! Like hungry dogs . It 's us they 're after , though . Dashed in and slashed them with their swords . Hear that !</stage>
    <stage>( Wild shouting below . )</stage>
    <stage>That 's for our blood . ( They listen . ) If we do n't arm , chief ,— CANZLER — Hark !</stage>
    <stage>FRITZ — ( After a pause . ) If we do n't arm —</stage>
    <stage>( Up the mountain sounds the battle horn . )</stage>
    <stage>To have lived to see this day !</stage>
    <stage>( He hurries up the path and disappears . )</stage>
    <stage>CANZLER — Val-father 's winds have blown them here to die .</stage>
    <stage>( He goes up the path . The music is now distinctly heard above the noise of the storm . A flash of lightning reveals , in the rear , the dwarf climbing up the mountain , leading Oswald by the hand . Instantly loud and prolonged shouting bursts up from about a hundred feet below . The two come hurrying forward along the ledge . Oswald 's face is streaked with blood and from the end of its black cord , his silver crucifix , likewise stained , dangles almost to his knees . Gradually it slips lower and lower till it finally falls and lies upon the grass . Having reached the path , they make their way up and are soon lost to view . That peculiar light which one sometimes sees when clouds are rifted during a storm illumines the scene and makes the green grass and trees show almost like flame . Below , voices are heard , and soon , climbing up the mountain , Father Benedict appears , his face pale , his eyes set before him . Upon the skirt of his snow-white chasuble there is seen , slanting down , a red streak as though he had pressed against a bloody sword-blade . Behind him , scattered , come , first , Hugh Capet with the great flag blown straight out in the wind , then Jules Bacqueur and Jacques Sar , their swords dripping , and , after them , the other villagers . )</stage>
    <stage>JULES BACQUEUR — Straight ahead . Father ! Straight ahead !</stage>
    <stage>A VOICE — ( From below . ) See them , Hugh ?</stage>
    <stage>JACQUES SAR — You come on ; we 'll find them .</stage>
    <stage>( Instead of coming forward to the path , which the bushes and bowlders hide from their view , they go pushing straight on up the rocks . )</stage>
    <stage>HUGH CAPET — Come on , men !</stage>
    <stage>JACQUES SAR — Stay together , men ! ( A pause . ) Hold her low , Phil !</stage>
    <stage>( Up the mountain sounds the battle-horn . )</stage>
    <stage>CRIES — Hear that ! Hear that !</stage>
    <stage>JACQUES SAR — Do n't get scared , men !</stage>
    <stage>CRIES — Do n't get scared ! Do n't get scared !</stage>
    <stage>A VOICE — God 's with us !</stage>
    <stage>ALL — God 's with us ! God 's with us !</stage>
    <stage>HUGH CAPET — Come on , men !</stage>
    <stage>JACQUES SAR — Wait for the signal ! Wait for the signal , men !</stage>
    <stage>( All look to the priest . )</stage>
    <stage>Now then .</stage>
    <stage>JULES BACQUEUR — Now , Father .</stage>
    <stage>A VOICE — Now . ( A pause . )</stage>
    <stage>HUGH CAPET — Signal ! signal !</stage>
    <stage>( Above , sounds the battle-horn , this time nearer . )</stage>
    <stage>JACQUES SAR — Now !</stage>
    <stage>JULES BACQUEUR — Now then !</stage>
    <stage>CRIES — Now ! Now ! NOW !</stage>
    <stage>( Slowly the priest lifts the crucifix . )</stage>
    <stage>ALL — God 's with us ! God 's with us !</stage>
    <stage>( They go springing up the mountain . A flash of lightning strikes the uplifted crucifix and clings for a moment like a wreath of blue fire round the brow of the priest whose face shows white as chalk . The crucifix slips from his fingers and he reels and falls backwards . )</stage>
    <stage>CRIES — Men ! Men ! Men !</stage>
    <stage>( As the men turn and see the priest , whom Jules has caught in his arms , borne backward down the slope , some of them throw down their arms and flee terror-stricken down the mountain . There is a loud crash of thunder followed , above , by the shouts of the Saxons who come charging down upon them . Attempting to rescue the priest 's body , before which Bacqueur has thrown his great shield , the villagers receive the shock and are driven back fighting down the mountain , Fritz hacking at Hugh Capet 's head-with his battle ax , Rudolph charging old Jacques , while Canzler with one slash of his magic sword slices in two Bacqueur 's great shield which falls like paper from his hands . Even after they have disappeared , from down the mountain can still be heard the voice of old Jacques calling to his men in God 's name to stand . Up the slope , caught in the bushes where it fell , hangs the crucifix , the figure of which is tarnished and melted by the lightning . On the ledge just below , outstretched upon the grass , his fingers bent as though still clutching the crucifix , lies the body of the priest . The scene gradually becomes darker and the thunder is still heard reverberating through the mountains . )</stage>
    <div type="scene" n="4">
     <head type="scene">SCENE FOUR — A forest on the mountain tops . Untouched by the</head>
     <stage type="setting">
      <stage>storm , which has swept the lower slopes , the trees here stand calm and motionless . Flowers are everywhere . Far off , between the innumerable trunks , is seen a space of dark sky rifted near the horizon and bright with the red and gold of the new dawn . From the left , into this forest stillness , silent as the scene itself , comes the dwarf leading Oswald by the hand . There is now no blood upon the latter 's face which , slightly upturned , is lighted as with a soul conscious of a great crisis and hearing its approach in the least noise . Suddenly , from far to the right , the voice of Selma is heard . Instantly the dwarf vanishes . Oswald starts and stands as one in a dream .</stage>

      <speaker>SELMA —</speaker>
      <p><stage>At first afar , then drawing nearer and nearer until at last she rushes in gleefully . She is dressed , as in the first Act , in green , and upon her head she wears a coronet of wild-flowers .</stage>Oswald ! Oswald ! Oswald ! Oswald ! Oswald !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>She starts , and throws herself at his feet , covering her face with her hands . The disc of the sun , emerging above the line of clouds , shoots its myriad golden needles through the wood . Revealed in the light , like things seen in a mirage , a number of fairies are discerned watching the two . From far down the mountain comes the sound of a bell tolling .</stage>
