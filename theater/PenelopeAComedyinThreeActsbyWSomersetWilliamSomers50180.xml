    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>SCENE : A drawing-room in O ’ FARRELL ’ S house in John Street . It is very prettily but not extravagantly furnished . The O ’ FARRELLS are a young married couple of modest income .</stage>
     <stage>It is between six and seven in the evening .</stage>
     <stage>PEYTON , a neat parlour-maid , opens the door and shows in MR. DAVENPORT BARLOW .</stage>
     <stage>BARLOW is a short , self-important person of middle age . He is very bald , red in the face , and wears a small , neatly curled moustache ; he is dressed in the height of fashion . His manner is fussy and pompous . He comes forward as though he expected to find some one in the room . Seeing that it is empty , he stops and looks at PEYTON . He cannot make out why there is no one to receive him .</stage>
    </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a tone of surprise .</stage>Is Mrs. O ’ Farrell not here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEYTON</speaker>
     <p>No , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>H ’ m .... Will you let her know I ’ ve come ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEYTON</speaker>
     <p>Mrs. O ’ Farrell is not at home , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Not at home ?... But ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEYTON</speaker>
     <p>Mrs. O ’ Farrell said , would you kindly sit down and make yourself comfortable ? And I was to give you the Morning Post .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pompously .</stage>I can ’ t imagine why Mrs. O ’ Farrell should think I haven ’ t read the Morning Post at six o ’ clock in the evening .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEYTON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Imperturbably .</stage>And Mrs. O ’ Farrell said , will you have a whisky and soda , sir ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>But when is Mrs. O ’ Farrell coming in ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEYTON</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t know at all , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>But she telegraphed to me this afternoon , asking me to come and see her at once .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEYTON</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir ; I took the telegram to the post office myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>It seems very extraordinary that she should have gone out . The matter was of considerable importance .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEYTON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Politely .</stage>Yes , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Very well , I ’ ll sit down and wait . But I can ’ t stay long . I ’ m dining at ... no matter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEYTON</speaker>
     <p>Very good , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PEYTON goes out . BARLOW goes to a looking-glass , takes a little brush out of his pocket , and brushes his moustache . PEYTON comes in again with a small tray on which are a decanter , a syphon , and a glass .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Oh , thank you . Did you say you had the Morning Post ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEYTON</speaker>
     <p><stage>She hands it to him .</stage>Yes , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Ah , thank you .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PEYTON goes out . BARLOW helps himself to a whisky and soda , turns to the fashionable intelligence in the paper , and begins to read it with a little smile of self-satisfaction .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p><stage>Half to himself .</stage>The Duchess of St. Erth returned to Wales yesterday . The Marchioness of Mereston has arrived at 89 Grosvenor Square . The Marchioness of Serlo and Lady Eleanor King leave for Paris this morning .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PEYTON comes in , followed by MRS. GOLIGHTLY . MRS. GOLIGHTLY is an extremely stout , good-natured lady of middle age . She is very active , but short of breath . She gives one a continual impression of having just run up a steep hill . She is DAVENPORT BARLOW ’ S sister .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEYTON</speaker>
     <p>Mrs. Golightly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Isabel !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Are you here , Davenport ? Where ’ s Penelope ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p><stage>As if it were the most extraordinary thing in the world .</stage>She ’ s out !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Astonished .</stage>Out ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She turns to PEYTON with a look of inquiry .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEYTON</speaker>
     <p>Mrs. O ’ Farrell said , would you kindly sit down and make yourself comfortable , ma ’ am ? And I was to bring you the Church Times .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>But ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEYTON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Calmly .</stage>And Mrs. O ’ Farrell said , will you have a strong cup of tea , ma ’ am ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m surprised that Mrs. O ’ Farrell should have gone out , because she expected me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEYTON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Handing MRS. GOLIGHTLY a paper .</stage>Yes , ma ’ am .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taking it .</stage>What is this ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEYTON</speaker>
     <p>The Church Times , ma ’ am .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a look of exasperation at BARLOW .</stage>Oh , thank you .... I think I will have a cup of tea , please .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEYTON</speaker>
     <p>Very good , ma ’ am .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Exit .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I wonder why on earth Penelope should insist on my reading the Church</l>
      <l>Times .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve just had a telegram from her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>So have I , asking me to come at once .<stage>With a ray of light .</stage>Perhaps we shall find some explanation in the Church Times .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Nonsense . What can the Church Times have to do with the Archduchess</l>
      <l>Anastasia ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>My dear Davenport , what are you talking about ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PEYTON enters to announce PROFESSOR GOLIGHTLY and immediately afterwards goes out . GOLIGHTLY is a tall , spare man with grey hair , well groomed and alert . He is neatly dressed , quite tidy , and might just as well be a lawyer or a doctor as a professor of mathematics . He is clean-shaven .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEYTON</speaker>
     <p>Professor Golightly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Hulloa , Davenport !<stage>To his wife .</stage>My dear , you ’ re the last person I expected to find here . I thought there was a meeting of the Missionary Society at the Albert Hall .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PEYTON comes in with a tray on which are tea-things , a glass of barley-water , and a copy of the “ Athenæum .”</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , thank you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEYTON</speaker>
     <p><stage>To GOLIGHTLY .</stage>Mrs. O ’ Farrell said , will you have a glass of barley-water , sir ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Barley-water !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEYTON</speaker>
     <p>And I was to bring you the Athenæum . We couldn ’ t get this week ’ s , sir , but this is last week ’ s , and Mrs. O ’ Farrell hopes it will do as well .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a faint smile .</stage>It ’ s very kind of you to have taken so much trouble .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEYTON</speaker>
     <p>Thank you , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Exit .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>What on earth does Penelope want me to do with last week ’ s Athenæum and a glass of barley-water ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Well , presumably she wants you to drink the one and to read the other .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>To his wife .</stage>My dear , I think it ’ s very hard that you should have brought up our only child on the idea that my favourite form of refreshment is barley-water .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>It looks as if Penelope expected you , too .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve just had a wire from her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Have you ? I wonder why on earth she wired to you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s so extraordinary that she shouldn ’ t be here . It makes me feel very nervous .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Well , frankly , I couldn ’ t make head or tail of it , so I jumped into a motor cab and came round from the club at once .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PEYTON comes in , followed by BEADSWORTH . He is a middle-aged solicitor , with a benign manner .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEYTON</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Beadsworth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Well , I ’ m hanged .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>My dear Charles , I wish you wouldn ’ t be slangy . It ’ s gone out in our set .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BEADSWORTH</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Shaking hands with MRS. GOLIGHTLY .</stage>
      <l>I ’ ve just had a telegram from</l>
      <l>Penelope asking me to come at once .</l>
      <stage>Turning to PEYTON .</stage>
      <l>Will you let</l>
      <l>Mrs. O ’ Farrell know I ’ m here ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>She ’ s out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEYTON</speaker>
     <p>Mrs. O ’ Farrell said , would you make yourself comfortable , sir , and we ’ ve got the Law Times if you ’ d like to read it , and will you have a glass of port , sir ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>BEADSWORTH looks round at the others in bewilderment .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>By all means have a glass of port , and I ’ ll swop it for my barley-water .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BEADSWORTH</speaker>
     <p><stage>To PEYTON .</stage>Thank you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEYTON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Handing him the paper .</stage>Very good , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Exit .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BEADSWORTH</speaker>
     <p>What does she want me to do with the Law Times ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>I asked the same question when Peyton handed me last week ’ s Athenæum , and Davenport , with the perspicacity that distinguishes him , answered : read it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BEADSWORTH</speaker>
     <p>Can you tell me what Penelope wants ? Her telegram suggested that she wished to see me not as an old friend , but in my official capacity as the family solicitor .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>I haven ’ t an idea . I thought her telegram most mysterious .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>I wish she ’ d come in . I ’ m beginning to be dreadfully uneasy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rather pompously .</stage>I think I can put your minds at rest . I am in a position to explain the whole matter to you . The telegram she sent me makes it perfectly clear . I daresay you know that the Archduchess Anastasia is a patient of Dickie ’ s . And a very nice patient for him to have . I ’ ve never met her , though I happen to know several members of her family , and she ’ s a very cultivated , pleasant woman . I ’ ve always said to Dickie that that is the sort of practice he ought to get . The middle classes do a doctor no good .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>My dear Davenport , do go on with your story .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Well , it appears that the Archduchess Anastasia has signified her desire to know Penelope . Very charming and graceful action on her part , and just like her . Of course she ’ s extremely grateful to Dickie for all he ’ s done . He ’ s worked a miraculous cure , and I daresay she ’ s heard that Penelope is my niece . It ’ s a maxim you can always go on : royalty knows everything . And the long and the short of it is that she ’ s coming to lunch here . Of course Penelope knows nothing about these matters , and in a state of great excitement she ’ s sent for me . It ’ s the best thing she could do . I can tell her everything . I ’ ve lived in that set all my life . It ’ s nothing to be particularly proud about — mere accident of birth — I happen to be a gentleman . A certain family . Well , there it is , you see .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>But do you mean to say that Penelope wired all that to you ? It must have cost her a perfect fortune .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>She put it a little more briefly , of course , but that was the gist of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BEADSWORTH</speaker>
     <p>I can ’ t imagine why she should send for me because a royalty is coming to luncheon with her . It was very inconvenient to get away . I had a dozen people waiting to see me , and I was obliged to slip out by the back door in order to avoid them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>But what are the exact words of the wire she sent you , Davenport ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>You can see it if you like .</l>
      <stage>Taking it from his pocket and reading .</stage>
      <l>“ Come at once . Archduchess Anastasia . Penelope .”</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>But d ’ you mean to say that you made up all that story out of those three words ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Penelope knew I had a certain amount of intelligence . She didn ’ t want to waste her money , so she just put what was essential , and left me to gather the rest .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>But my telegram says nothing about the Archduchess Anastasia .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>What did Penelope say to you ?</p>

     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Taking out the telegram .</stage>
      <l>“ Come at once ! Grave scandal ! Central</l>
      <l>African Mission . Penelope .”</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>But that ’ s absurd . You know how stupid the Post Office is . They must have made a mistake . I know that the Pomeranian Royal Family is very odd , but there are limits , and I can ’ t imagine the Archduchess Anastasia being mixed up in a scandal with a Central African missionary .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BEADSWORTH</speaker>
     <p>Well , my wire merely said : “ Come at once ; six and eightpence . Penelope .”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Six and eightpence ! Why six and eightpence ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BEADSWORTH</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t know . That is why I lost no time in coming .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a twinkle .</stage>My impression is that the Archduchess Anastasia , instead of paying Dickie ’ s bill for miraculously curing her , has eloped with a missionary , and Penelope , by aid of the law<stage>with a gesture towards BEADSWORTH</stage>, wants to recover the money .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s nonsense ! You ’ re so unpractical , Charles .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>To her husband .</stage>But you had a telegram too , dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>“ Come at once . Decimal 7035 . Penelope .”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>How very odd .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The door is softly opened and PENELOPE slips in ; for a moment the others do not see her , and she stands smiling at them . GOLIGHTLY catches sight of her . All the others turn .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Penelope .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE OTHERS</speaker>
     <p>Penelope .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coming forward and kissing MRS. GOLIGHTLY .</stage>Good evening , mamma !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p><stage>Eagerly .</stage>Well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Well , papa .<stage>She puts her face up for him to kiss .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Anxiously .</stage>Now , Penelope .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Mr. Beadsworth , how nice of you to come .<stage>She shakes hands with him .</stage>Kiss me , Uncle Davenport .<stage>She calmly puts up her face . With some irritation he kisses her .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Thank you .... Was your whisky and soda quite right ?<stage>Looking round .</stage>And the port ? Father , you haven ’ t touched the barley-water . You ungrateful old thing !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Exasperated .</stage>My dear , for goodness ’ sake explain .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Where have you been all this time ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I — I ’ ve been sitting in the consulting-room .<stage>With a roguish smile .</stage>I watched you all come in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rather injured .</stage>Peyton said you were out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Really , Penelope , I think your behaviour is outrageous .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>You see , I thought if I saw you one after the other as you came in , I should have to make four scenes instead of one . It would have been very exhausting and not nearly so effective .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Are you going to make a scene ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With the greatest satisfaction .</stage>I ’ m going to make a dreadful scene in a minute .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Now , my dear , before you go any further , for goodness ’ sake tell us what you meant by your telegrams .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Well , you see , I wanted you all to come immediately , and I thought the best thing was to trail your ruling passions under your noses .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Do you understand what she means , Charles ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>My dear mother , it ’ s the simplest thing in the world . You spend your life in converting the heathen — from a distance — and I knew if I mentioned the Central African Mission you ’ d fly here on the wings of the wind .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>In point of fact I came in an omnibus . But do you mean to tell me that there has been no scandal in connection with the Central African Mission ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>I ’ m dreadfully sorry to disappoint you , mother .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>And what in heaven ’ s name made you wire decimal 7035 to me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Oh , that ’ s our telephone number , and I just put decimal instead of</l>
      <l>Gerrard .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>I thought the figures were strangely familiar .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>And there you are , you see .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p><stage>Chuckling .</stage>I think it ’ s a capital idea . And she just flung the words six and eightpence at you , Beadsworth , and knew she ’ d fetch the lawyer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>To BEADSWORTH .</stage>You ’ re not cross with me , are you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He shakes his head , smiling .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>And now , my dear , that you ’ ve disposed of them , tell me all about the</l>
      <l>Archduchess Anastasia .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking at him blankly .</stage>The Archduchess Anastasia ? But I invented her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>What d ’ you mean , you invented her ? I know her well , I ’ ve known her for years . I know her whole family .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rather embarrassed , but trying not to laugh .</stage>Well , you see — I wanted you to come , too . And ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t understand what you mean at all , Penelope . You mention one of my most intimate friends , and then you tell me you invented her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m awfully sorry . I really didn ’ t know there was such a person , and I thought I ’ d made her up out of my own head ....<stage>With a chuckle .</stage>I think it was rather clever of me to hit upon some one you know so well .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t know why you should think the mere mention of the Archduchess ’ s name would make me come here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Well , you see , I know that you go out a great deal , and you know such crowds of people . I felt quite sure that if there were an Archduchess Anastasia you ’ d know her , and<stage>with a wave of the hand</stage>well , there it is you see .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>BARLOW fumes silently , but does not answer .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Now , Penelope , tell us what you really do want .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>In matter-of-fact tones .</stage>I want to divorce Dickie .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>What !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>My dear child .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Good gracious !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>These three speeches are said simultaneously .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Ruefully .</stage>I intended to make such a scene , and now you ’ ve made me blurt it all out in three words .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>But I don ’ t understand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ll say it again , shall I ? I want to divorce Dickie .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BEADSWORTH</speaker>
     <p>You don ’ t really mean it , do you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Indignantly .</stage>Of course I mean it . I ’ m never going to speak to him again . That ’ s to say , I shall have a scene with him first . I ’ m quite determined to have a scene with somebody .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>And where is Dickie now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>He ’ s on his way home with the usual story .<stage>With a sudden break in her voice .</stage>Oh , if you only knew how utterably miserable I am .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>My darling , is it really serious ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Desperately .</stage>Oh , what can I do to make you all understand ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>The best way would be to begin at the beginning , and tell us all about it coherently .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pompously .</stage>My dear Charles , this is not the kind of matter in which you can be of any use . You ’ re a mathematician , and you ’ re not expected to know anything about practical affairs .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Faintly ironic .</stage>I apologise profusely .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>To PENELOPE , to ask her to speak .</stage>Darling ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Well , the first thing is that I simply dote upon Dickie . I ’ ve never loved any one else , and I never shall .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BEADSWORTH</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s a very satisfactory confession after four years of matrimony .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Five years , three months , and two days . And every day I ’ ve loved Dickie more .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BEADSWORTH</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve never seen a more devoted couple .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>We ’ ve never had a quarrel . We ’ ve never even been cross with one another . It ’ s been a honeymoon that ’ s never come to an end .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>And now I ’ ve discovered that he ’ s been lying to me for the last month . He ’ s been coming home dreadfully late , and when I ’ ve asked him where he ’ s been , he ’ s said that he had to see a patient who was very ill — such an interesting case — and it worried him so much that he was obliged to go to his club and have a rubber to settle his nerves . And the interesting case and the rubber of bridge are Ada Fergusson .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pompously .</stage>But who is Ada Fergusson ? I ’ ve never heard of her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Ada Fergusson ’ s a great friend of mine . And I hate her . I always knew she was a cat . For the last four weeks Dickie ’ s been spending every afternoon with her from four till seven .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Raising his eyebrows .</stage>But do you always ask your husband where he ’ s been when he comes in ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Impatiently .</stage>My dear papa , what has that got to do with it ? We all know that you ’ re an old dear , and the greatest mathematician in the world , but you know nothing about life at all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>I apologise again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Give him a sheet of paper and a pencil , Penelope , and he ’ ll amuse himself by doing sums while we talk the matter out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pushing writing materials over to him .</stage>There you are , papa .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BEADSWORTH</speaker>
     <p>But how did you find out ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Impatiently .</stage>Oh , what does it matter how I found out ! I ’ ve got all sorts of proofs .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>You could knock me down with a feather .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a smile .</stage>My dear !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>I am not in the least surprised .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Uncle Davenport !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>I have expected it all along . You will remember , Isabel , that I was against the marriage from the beginning . I said , one doesn ’ t marry a doctor . One sometimes meets them in society when they ’ ve had their angles rubbed off a little and perhaps have been knighted , but one never meets their wives . We suppose they do marry , but they don ’ t marry any one we know . I may be old-fashioned , but I stick to my opinion that there are only three possible professions for a gentleman , the law , the army , and the church .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>My dear Uncle Davenport , you ’ re talking nonsense .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p><stage>Huffily .</stage>You ask me for my opinion , and I give it you . I regret that you should think it nonsense .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BEADSWORTH</speaker>
     <p>And what are you proposing to do now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With great determination .</stage>I ’ m never going to live with Dickie again . As soon as I ’ ve seen him I shall leave this house for ever .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BEADSWORTH</speaker>
     <p>You ’ re proposing to have a few words with him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Several . I ’ m going to tell him that I despise him , and that I hate him ; I ’ m going to throw my wedding ring in his face , and then I shall sweep out of the room .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BEADSWORTH</speaker>
     <p>Have you really made up your mind that you won ’ t forgive him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Nothing would induce me ever to speak to him again if it weren ’ t that I want to tell him exactly what I think of him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Besides , you ’ ve got your family to think of . Of course you must leave him . You see , that is what I say , you ’ re not safe with people of no birth . I look upon all this as a blessing in disguise .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BEADSWORTH</speaker>
     <p>Do you wish to bring an action for judicial separation ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>My dear Mr. Beadsworth , what are you talking about ! I ’ m going to divorce him . I ’ m going to make an awful scandal .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BEADSWORTH</speaker>
     <p>Well , I suppose we could arrange that at a pinch with the help of the newspapers . Has he ever been cruel to you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Good heavens , no ! That ’ s what makes me so angry . The last month he ’ s been more perfectly charming and delightful than ever . Oh , I wish I could do something really unpleasant to Ada Fergusson . Something with boiling oil in it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>I am shocked , frankly shocked . I would never have thought that Dickie could be so wicked .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Family life in England is going to the dogs . That is the long and short of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Suddenly PENELOPE catches sight of what GOLIGHTLY has been diligently writing . She gives the paper a startled look and then turns round .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Mother , a dreadful thing has happened . Papa has suddenly become a drivelling lunatic .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>My dear , what are you saying ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>He ’ s been adding two and two together all over that piece of paper , and he makes it five every time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Charles !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PENELOPE hands the sheet to BARLOW .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Look .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Two and two are five . Two and two are five .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He passes it on to BEADSWORTH .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BEADSWORTH</speaker>
     <p>Two and two are five . Two and two are five .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>I knew this would happen . I ’ ve been expecting it for years .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Charles , pull yourself together .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Papa , you don ’ t really think that two and two are five ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>On the contrary , I ’ m convinced that two and two are four .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Then why on earth have you made it five ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Do you know why you buy Pears ’ soap ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I expect you ’ ve been working too hard , father dear . Why don ’ t you go and lie down for half an hour ? And when Dickie comes in he ’ ll give you a tonic .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>You buy Pears ’ soap because you ’ re told on fifty thousand hoardings that it ’ s matchless for the complexion .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s not funny , papa , that ’ s silly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>You ’ ve only got to say a thing often enough , and all the world will believe it . And when the world believes it , it ’ s very hard to say if it ’ s true or not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>What has that got to do with two and two ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>I thought if I wrote “ two and two are five ” often enough I might come to think it true .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>But if you wrote it a million times it wouldn ’ t be any truer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>That is the conclusion I ’ m regretfully forced to .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>The whole of life is merely a matter of adding two and two together and getting the right answer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>My dear Charles , if you ’ re going to discuss life I think there ’ s no need for me to stay . I ’ ve told you for twenty years that you ’ re a scholar and a recluse . I have lived in the world , and I ’ m a practical man . If Penelope wants to consult me , I am at her service ; if not ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Hold your tongue , Uncle Davenport .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Really , Penelope .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>During the last five years I ’ ve seen you adding two and two together and making them about seventy-nine .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t know what you ’ re talking about , Charles . Dickie ’ s behaviour is abominable , and there are no excuses for him . It ’ s a mere matter of common morality .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>My dear , I have no objection to you talking common morality if you ’ ll let me talk common sense .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>My dear Charles , they ’ re the same thing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>If you think you can make me forgive Dickie by telling me that you were a wicked old thing yourself in your youth , I may as well tell you at once that it won ’ t wash .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Outraged .</stage>What are you talking about , my dear ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Well , I ’ ve noticed that when a woman discovers that her husband has been unfaithful , her male relations invariably try to console her by telling her how shockingly they ’ ve treated their own wives .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>My dear , I was going to confess nothing of the sort . I never confess .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Of course , if it were the other way about , and mamma had kicked over the traces a little ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Darling , can you see me performing an acrobatic feat of that character ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Go on , papa .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>I think you ’ ve treated Dickie shamefully .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Astounded .</stage>I ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>If your mother had behaved to me as you ’ ve behaved to Dickie , I should certainly have taken to drink .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>But I ’ ve been a perfect angel . I ’ ve simply worshipped the ground he walked on . I ’ ve loved him as no man was ever loved before .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>No man could stand it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Papa , what do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>My dear , you ’ ve loved him morning , noon , and night . You ’ ve loved him when he talked , and you ’ ve loved him when he was silent . You ’ ve loved him walking , you ’ ve loved him eating , you ’ ve loved him sleeping . He ’ s never been able to escape from your love .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>But I couldn ’ t help it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>You need not have shown it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>And do you mean to say that justifies him in philandering with Ada</l>
      <l>Fergusson ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>It excuses him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>What beasts men must be !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>No ; but strange as it may seem to you , they ’ re human beings . When you were a child you doted on strawberry ices .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I dote on them still .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Would you like to eat strawberry ice for breakfast , lunch , tea , and dinner every day for a month ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Good heavens ! the thought fills me with horror .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Poor Dickie has lived on strawberry ice for five years . It ’ s been his only means of sustenance .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With consternation .</stage>Oh !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>You ’ ve never let him go out without coming into the hall to put on his hat and kiss him good-bye ; he ’ s never come into the house without you running down to help him off with his coat and kiss him welcome . When he sat down after breakfast in the morning to read his paper and smoke his pipe , I ’ ve seen you sit down on the arm of his chair and put your arm round his neck .</p>
    </sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BEADSWORTH</speaker>
     <p>I must confess I ’ m thankful my wife occupied those moments in attending to her household duties .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>You are a lot of horrid old things . I ask you to come here to sympathise with me , and you ’ re perfectly brutal to me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>My dear Penelope , there are limits .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Well , I don ’ t care ; I ’ m going to divorce him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Let ’ s do another little simple addition , shall we ? Perhaps two and two will make four a second time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t know that I much like being a mathematician ’ s daughter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t you think , instead of divorcing your husband , it would be better to win back his affection ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t want his affection .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>Are you sure you wouldn ’ t if you could get it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PENELOPE looks at her father for a moment , then goes up to him quickly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With tears in her voice .</stage>Papa , d ’ you think I ever could win back his love ? You say I ’ ve lost it through my own fault . Oh , I don ’ t know what to do without him . I ’ ve been so wretched since I knew . I ’ ve tried to put a cheerful face on it , but if you knew what I feel in my heart .... Oh , the brutes , why didn ’ t they hide it from me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>My dear Penelope , I expected you to have more spirit . He ’ s a person of no family . I should have thought you were well rid of him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Uncle Davenport , if you say a word against him , I will immediately have an attack of hysterics .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>What you expect your father to be able to tell you I can ’ t imagine .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings , Davenport ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>I shouldn ’ t have thought one could describe you as either . But , in any case , I can stay no longer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , no , don ’ t go yet , Uncle Davenport .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>It appears that my advice is not wanted , and I promised to look in on dear Lady Hollington before dinner .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Do telephone to her that you can ’ t come . You ’ ll find a telephone in my sitting-room .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p><stage>Shrugging his shoulders .</stage>I ’ m too indulgent . People don ’ t rate me at my proper value .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Papa , say you ’ ll get Dickie back for me . I want him . I want him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>My dear , it ’ s very simple . It merely requires a great deal of tact , a great deal of courage , and a great deal of self-control .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Ironically .</stage>Nothing else ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>A good deal . You must never let yourself out of hand ; you must keep guard on your tongue and your eyes and your smiles — and your temper .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I think you said it was very simple .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Is Ada Fergusson pretty ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>No , she ’ s perfectly hideous .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Is she ? That makes it more serious .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>If a man falls in love with a pretty woman , he falls out of it . But if he falls in love with a plain one , he ’ ll be in love with her all his life .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>You take a load off my mind . Ada Fergusson ’ s extremely attractive .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Then you ’ ll get him back .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Tell me exactly what to do , and I ’ ll do it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Give him his head .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Is that all ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>It means a good deal . When he comes in , don ’ t make a scene , but be charming to him . For once , don ’ t ask him where he ’ s been . When he leaves you , don ’ t ask him where he ’ s going , nor at what time he ’ ll be back . Don ’ t let him know that you have the least suspicion that anything has happened . On the contrary , take every opportunity of throwing him into Ada Fergusson ’ s society .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Charles , you ’ re asking Penelope to connive at immorality .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>When every difficulty disappears , Dickie will find half the savour of the intrigue gone . Half your battle is won . Leave the rest to time and Ada Fergusson . Let Ada Fergusson sit on the arm of his chair when he wants to read his paper . Let him account to Ada Fergusson for all his movements . Under such circumstances a woman is always on tenterhooks , and consequently she ’ s always exacting . Whenever there ’ s a pause in the conversation , Ada Fergusson will say , Do you care for me as much as ever you did ? That speech is the rope around love ’ s throat . Whenever he wants to go away , Ada Fergusson will implore him to stay five minutes longer . Those five minutes that a man stays against his will are the nails in love ’ s coffin . Each time he leaves her Ada Fergusson will say , At what time will you be back ? That question is the earth shovelled into love ’ s grave .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>All this while PENELOPE has been staring at GOLIGHTLY with astonishment .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Where did you learn all this , father ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a deprecating shrug .</stage>It ’ s a mere matter of adding two and two together , my darling .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I had no idea that mathematics were so interesting — nor so immoral .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>What do you think of it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>But if Dickie falls out of love with Ada Fergusson there ’ s no reason why he should fall in love again with me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>You must make him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I wish I knew how .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>It only requires a little more tact , a little more courage , and a little more self-control .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>But if I acquire so many virtues I shan ’ t be a woman , but a monster , and how can he love me then ?</p>

     <p>Hulloa ! I couldn ’ t make out what had become of you , Pen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>You generally come down to meet me when I get in .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PENELOPE gives a slight start and conceals a smile .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>My sainted mother is here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gaily .</stage>That ’ s no reason why you should neglect a devoted husband .<stage>Shaking hands with MRS. GOLIGHTLY .</stage>How is your sainted mother ? Hulloa , Uncle Davenport , what price duchesses to-day ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>I beg your pardon . I don ’ t know what you mean .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking round at the decanters and glasses with which the room is scattered .</stage>I say , you ’ ve been doing yourselves rather proud , haven ’ t you ? Who ’ s been drinking port ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Nobody . It ’ s an empty glass .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s how providence behaves to me . Deliberately puts temptation in my way . It ’ s simply poison . Gout in my family , you know . My ancestors have lived on colchicum for a hundred years . I feel a tingling in my toes at the mere sight of a bottle of port . And yet I drink it .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He fills himself a glass and sips it with great content .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s a great mistake , of course , to think that gout is a mark of good family . The porter of my club is a martyr to it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps he ’ s the illegitimate son of an earl . You should ask him if he has a strawberry mark on his left shoulder . What ’ s the matter , Pen ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Astonished .</stage>With me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I thought you seemed a bit under the weather .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t know . You ’ re not quite up to your usual form , are you ? You ’ ve not asked me what I ’ ve been doing to-day . As a rule you ’ re so interested in my movements .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a glance at her father .</stage>I thought you ’ d tell me if you wanted to .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I say , I do think that ’ s a bit thick . I go slaving my very soul out to provide you with a motor and nice frocks and things , and you don ’ t take the smallest interest in what I do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>Well , what have you been doing this afternoon ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a sigh of relief .</stage>Oh , I ’ ve had the very deuce of a day . I ’ ve got a very interesting case on just now . Taking up a lot of my time . Of course , it worries me rather , but I suppose all these things come in the day ’ s march . Well , I spent the best part of an hour there .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>An hour ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , we had a consultation , you know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>But you had a consultation yesterday .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Yesterday ? Yes , she ’ s a fussy old thing . She ’ s always wanting consultations .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s jolly , isn ’ t it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t think it is . It looks as if she hadn ’ t really confidence in me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>On the other hand , you can charge double , can ’ t you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , of course , it has that advantage .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve been hankering after an ermine stole for a long time . I shall buy it now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>His face falling .</stage>Oh , but I haven ’ t been paid yet .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>They ’ ll be only too glad to wait . And it ’ s such a bargain .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>To change the conversation .</stage>Well , after my consultation I was so fagged that I had to go into the club to have a rubber of Bridge .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>By the way , what is the name of your patient ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>The name of my patient ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , yes , I was telling papa that you ’ d got a new patient who was bringing in pots of money . I couldn ’ t remember her name .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Embarrassed .</stage>Oh — er , Mrs. Mac ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Mrs. Mac what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Mrs. Macnothing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>How d ’ you mean , Mrs. Macnothing ? I ’ ve never heard of a family called</l>
      <l>Macnothing .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>No , of course , her name isn ’ t Macnothing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>But you distinctly said it was Mrs. Macnothing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Now , my dear Pen , did I say anything about Macnothing ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Well , what is her name then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve been telling you for the last ten minutes . Her name ’ s Mrs. Mack .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Why on earth didn ’ t you say so at once ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>How did you find such a profitable patient ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , it was a great piece of luck . She heard about me from that little friend of yours , Pen . What is her name ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>You seem to have a very bad memory for names , Dickie . You should make a knot in your handkerchief .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s a friend of Pen ’ s .<stage>Pretending to try and remember .</stage>Her husband ’ s in the navy , stationed at Malta , isn ’ t he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Ada Fergusson .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s it , of course . Mrs. Fergusson .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>One of the Fergussons of Kingarth , I suppose ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t know at all . Quite a nice little thing , I thought . I must confess that she didn ’ t interest me very much .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PEYTON comes in to announce MRS. FERGUSSON . MRS. FERGUSSON is a handsome , showy woman of about thirty .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEYTON</speaker>
     <p>Mrs. Fergusson .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DICKIE is filled with consternation . PEYTON goes out . There is a very brief moment of embarrassment , but PENELOPE quickly recovers herself and goes up to the visitor effusively .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>How d ’ you do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Is it a preposterous hour to pay a call ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Of course not . I ’ m always delighted to see you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve been shopping the whole afternoon , and it suddenly occurred to me that I hadn ’ t seen you for ages .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Do you know my sainted mother ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>How d ’ you do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>This is my noble father , and this is my uncle .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>How d ’ you do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He is evidently much struck by MRS. FERGUSSON .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Turning blandly to DICKIE .</stage>You haven ’ t forgotten me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Of course not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>We haven ’ t met for ages , have we ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Simply ages .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>I passed you in Piccadilly the other day , and you cut me dead .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m so sorry , I ’ m so short-sighted .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Dickie , you ’ re not at all short-sighted . How can you tell such fibs ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p><stage>With pompous gallantry .</stage>Dickie feels that only a physical impediment can excuse a man for not seeing a pretty woman .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Oh , how very nice of you to say that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Not at all , not at all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I wanted to thank you for getting Dickie such a splendid patient .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hastily , seeing her look of astonishment .</stage>I ’ ve just been telling my wife about Mrs. Mack .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Not in the least understanding .</stage>Oh , yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>It was really awfully good of you to tell her to send for me . I ’ ve been to see her this afternoon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Understanding .</stage>Oh , yes . I like to do all I can for people . I hope you ’ ll find her a nice patient .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>She seems to require a lot of visits .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Yes , she was only telling me the other day how much she liked Dr. O ’ Farrell . I ’ m afraid she ’ s very ill , poor dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>To tell you the truth , I ’ m extremely worried about her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s a great comfort to all her friends to know that Dr. O ’ Farrell is looking after her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve been wondering if she ’ s one of the Staffordshire Macks or one of the Somersetshire Macks .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t know at all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>How d ’ you mean you don ’ t know at all ? She must be one or the other .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t see that it matters either way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>What is she like ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I don ’ t know . Like everybody else , I suppose .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t be silly , Dickie . You must know if she ’ s fat or thin .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking at MRS. FERGUSSON .</stage>I should say fat , wouldn ’ t you ?</p>

    </sp>

     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>You must tell her how sorry we are to hear she ’ s so ill .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I didn ’ t . It invented itself . I was obliged to account for my movements .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>But I must fly too . I really had no idea it was so late .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Are you doing anything to-night ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Oh , no ! I live very quietly . There ’ s nothing that I enjoy more than an evening all by myself , with a book .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>You used to be so fond of going out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>I know that my husband prefers me to remain at home . And when I think of him bravely serving his country in a foreign land I have no heart for gaiety .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>What a charming nature you have .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>To DICKIE .</stage>My husband ’ s in a man-of-war . He ’ s stationed at Malta , you know . It ’ s so dreadful that my health forces me to remain in England .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I wonder if you ’ d do me a great kindness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>My dear , I ’ ll always do anything for an old friend .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>The fact is , I ’ ve had a perfectly fiendish headache the whole afternoon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Triumphantly .</stage>I knew there was something the matter with you the moment I came in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>We ’ ve got a couple of stalls for a music hall to-night . It would be awfully kind of you if you ’ d go with Dickie instead of me .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>A look of intelligence passes between DICKIE and MRS. FERGUSSON .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>I ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Dickie hates going out alone , and I simply can ’ t stir . You can have a jolly little dinner together at a restaurant , and you can go on afterwards .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Are you really sure you can ’ t go , Pen ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s absolutely out of the question .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t you think Dr. O ’ Farrell ought to stay and look after you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , no ! It ’ ll do him good to go out . He ’ s been working so dreadfully hard . This afternoon he had a consultation that lasted nearly an hour .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>To DICKIE .</stage>Would you like me to come with you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I should love it , if it wouldn ’ t bore you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Then I shall be delighted .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Thanks so much . But it ’ s getting very late . I think you ought to start at once .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>You ’ re sure you don ’ t mind my leaving you , Penelope ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Positive .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Well , just wait a moment , and I ’ ll make you up a dose of something .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hastily .</stage>Oh , no , I promise you I ’ m much better without medicine .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Nonsense . Of course I must give you something .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s the advantage of having a doctor in the family .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Crossly .</stage>Yes , it ’ s a great advantage .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>I do envy you , having your husband always at hand . When I think of mine bravely serving his country — and you know , every doctor I go to tells me it would be most dangerous for me to join him .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DICKIE comes in with a little medicine glass , filled with a milky fluid .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Here it is .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , no , Dickie , I ’ d much rather not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t be silly , darling . This ’ ll pull you together like anything .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m sure she ought to lie down .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>No , I think I ’ d rather stand up if you don ’ t mind .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>How extraordinarily unreasonable you are ! Now lie down on this sofa .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Of course , if I absolutely must .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She lies down on a sofa .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>We must make you comfortable before we go .</p>

     <p>Let ’ s put all the cushions behind her . Is that nice ?</p>

     <p>Yes , thank you .</p>

     <p>Poor little thing .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m sure she ought to have something over her feet .</p>

     <p>Let ’ s put this rug over her feet . There . Now take this medicine .... There ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , no , Dickie . I ’ ll take it after you ’ ve gone . I really will . I promise you I ’ ll take it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Why on earth can ’ t you take it now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Well , I hate making faces before you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>But I ’ ve often seen you make faces .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , at you . That ’ s quite a different thing .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>With great determination .</stage>I ’ m not going to stir from this room till you ’ ve taken it .</p>

      <stage>Resigned .</stage>
      <l>Give it me . Hold my nose , Dickie .</l>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>It ’ ll make you feel like one o ’ clock .</p>

    <stage>DICKIE and MRS. FERGUSSON go out . PENELOPE springs up , throws the cushions angrily aside , makes one or two quick steps towards the door as though to call them back , then stops .</stage>

     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>No , I won ’ t . I won ’ t .</p>

    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>SCENE : DR. O ’ FARRELL ’ S consulting-room . It is a comfortably furnished room , with engravings on the walls , photographs in silver frames , and flowers on the chimney-piece . There is a large desk on one side , with papers on it , books , and a reading-lamp . There is a revolving-chair for DICKIE to sit in , and a chair on the other side of the desk for the patient . On a side table are a microscope , a stand for test tubes , one or two medicine bottles , a row of large bottles containing chemicals , and an electric lamp . There is a sofa without arms for patients to lie upon , and there are two or three chairs besides . On the shelves are medical books . On a little table is a pile of “ Lancets .”</stage>
     <stage>DICKIE is sitting at his desk , with his stethoscope still in his ears . A patient is standing up , buttoning up his braces . He puts on his waistcoat and coat as the conversation proceeds . He is a very timid little man , with a bald head and gold spectacles . He has an intensely nervous , apologetic manner .</stage>
    </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ll just write you out a prescription , shall I ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PATIENT</speaker>
     <p>Oh , it ’ s too good of you . I ’ m afraid I ’ m giving you so much trouble .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Not at all . Now what would you like me to give you ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>PATIENT</speaker>
     <p><stage>Dreadfully embarrassed .</stage>Oh , whatever you like , please . It ’ s too good of you .</p>

     <p>Oh , I ’ m so sorry . I really , really ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I should have thought you ’ d be rather pleased .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PATIENT</speaker>
     <p><stage>Apologetically .</stage>Yes , of course , I ’ m very much pleased . I didn ’ t mean that . I ’ ve taken up so much of your time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s only out of the people who ’ ve got nothing the matter with them that I make a living . The people who are ill either get well or die , and that ’ s the end of them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PATIENT</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I see . I never thought of that . Beautiful day it is , isn ’ t it ?</p>

     <p>Won ’ t you sit down ?</p>

     <p>Oh , it ’ s too good of you . Thank you , thank you . I ’ m afraid I ’ m taking up so much of your time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I always make my patients sit on the other side of my desk since one of them suddenly saw a snake on me , and flung himself at my throat in order to save me from being bitten . He nearly throttled me in the process , and when I knelt on his chest , he said I was an ungrateful devil , and he wouldn ’ t interfere with the snakes next time they went for me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PATIENT</speaker>
     <p><stage>Extremely agitated .</stage>Oh , but you don ’ t think there ’ s any danger of my flying at your throat , do you ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a laugh .</stage>No , of course not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PATIENT</speaker>
     <p>I drink nothing for my luncheon , and only claret and water for my dinner .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I suppose you wouldn ’ t think you ’ d had your money ’ s worth if I gave you no medicine ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PATIENT</speaker>
     <p>Oh , it ’ s too good of you , but I think , for my wife ’ s sake , I ’ d like to take something .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Well , look here , I ’ ve given you some strychnine to buck you up , and some bismuth to quiet you down . Take it three times a day after meals .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PATIENT</speaker>
     <p>Oh , thank you so much . I ’ m sure it ’ s just what I want . And now — er . And now — er ....</p>

    <stage>He gets up , overcome with embarrassment .</stage>

     <speaker>PATIENT</speaker>
     <p>No , er — thank you very much . I — er — it ’ s so good of you to have taken so much trouble . Yes , er ....</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PATIENT</speaker>
     <p><stage>Infinitely relieved .</stage>Oh , thank you so much . That ’ s just what I wanted to ask you . Shall I write you a cheque ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>We always prefer to have it in hard cash , you know , in case it ’ s a bogus cheque .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PATIENT</speaker>
     <p>Oh , certainly . It ’ s too good of you . I thought you mightn ’ t like it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s extraordinary how nervous people are about giving a doctor money . If you only knew how jolly glad he is to get it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PATIENT</speaker>
     <p>Yes . Thank you very much .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The patient takes two guineas out of his pocket and puts them nervously on the chimney-piece .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Hang it all , man , not on the mantelpiece . There are limits .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PATIENT</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I beg your pardon . I ’ m so sorry .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>We always like it put on the desk .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PATIENT</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t often come and consult doctors .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I can see that . If you did you ’ d probably give me two pounds and say you hadn ’ t got two shillings on you , especially if you were a woman .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PATIENT</speaker>
     <p>You don ’ t say so . Really it never occurred to me .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Come and sit down here , and we ’ ll have a smoke .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Aren ’ t you expecting patients ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , it ’ s just on five o ’ clock . I don ’ t suppose any one else will come . We might have tea down here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>How are things going ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Rotten . Look here , a wretched two guineas . That ’ s all I ’ ve made this afternoon .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PENELOPE comes in .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Well , father ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Kiss your noble parent , my child . You ’ ve got a new dress on .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I rather like it , don ’ t you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Is that another new frock , Pen ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , darling . Why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , nothing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>The wife of a fashionable physician has to spend a lot of money on her clothes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Dickie was lamenting that times were very bad .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>What can you expect with this beastly weather ! Fine , dry , cold day after day . We haven ’ t had a fog this autumn . It doesn ’ t give one a chance . Of course everybody keeps well . Times are getting worse and worse . Everybody has decent drains now . An officious Government gives people pure water . If it weren ’ t for patent medicines and the malade imaginaire half the doctors in London would starve .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Never mind , Dickie . There may be a motor accident just outside our front door one of these days .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>It would be just like my luck if they were all killed outright . No , what I want is a really good epidemic , a very complicated form of influenza that ’ d keep people on their backs for about a month .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>And supposing I got it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Well , if you got it that bounder on the other side of the street would have to treat you . And he couldn ’ t charge you as you ’ re my wife , and he ’ d simply grind his teeth at having to waste his time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>The bounder on the other side of the street is Dr. Rogers . I like him much better than Dickie .</p>

     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Pompous ass .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Breaking out .</stage>I can ’ t go on with it any longer . I ’ ve come to the end of my strength .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Is Dickie still ...?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Yes . I can ’ t imagine what he sees in her . I sit and watch her sometimes and wonder what she has that I haven ’ t got . You don ’ t think I ’ m plain , do you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Certainly not . If you had been I should have exposed you at your birth , like the ancient Spartans .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>There are lots of men who are willing to tell me that I ’ m extremely attractive .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Why don ’ t you let them ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>My dear father , you ’ re the most immoral parent I ’ ve ever come across .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a little deprecatory shrug .</stage>It might be politic .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Shaking her head .</stage>No , I don ’ t know whether I shall ever get Dickie back again , but I don ’ t want to get him back by exciting his jealousy . I don ’ t want his love if I can only have it by making him think other men are in love with me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Remember that two and two never make five .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Impatiently .</stage>It ’ s easy enough to give advice . You ’ ve only got to sit still and watch . I ’ ve got to do things . And the worst of it is that doing things means doing nothing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>My dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Now , father , don ’ t look as if you didn ’ t understand or I shall throw something at your head . It wouldn ’ t be so bad if I could be up and doing , but I just have to sit still and keep my temper . You don ’ t know what I ’ ve suffered this month with a smiling face . I ’ ve laughed while my heart ached . I ’ ve chaffed Dickie when I ’ ve known he was just going to meet Ada Fergusson . I ’ ve arranged little parties so that they might be together . I haven ’ t even dared to cry by myself in case Ada Fergusson should see that my eyes were red and tell Dickie . He ’ s seen her every day , every single day for the last month , and all the time I ’ ve been cheerful and pleasant and amusing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>But how does he manage to get the time ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Of course he ’ s been neglecting his practice . He ’ s sent his assistant to people he ought to have seen himself . You remember Mrs. Mack , don ’ t you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>The imaginary Mrs. Mack ? Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>If you knew how I hated Mrs. Mack ! She ’ s been having operations . She has an operation about once a week , and Dickie goes off for the whole day in his car .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>She must have the constitution of a boa-constrictor .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>And the curious thing is that she always has an operation when there ’ s a race meeting . She had an operation for the Duke of York ’ s Stakes at Kempton ; and she had another operation for the Cesarewitch , and a third for Sandown .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>How very singular .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>It is till you know that Ada Fergusson adores racing . And the thing that makes me so furious is that I ’ m quite certain Dickie puts on her money for her ; and when her horse wins she pockets the profits , and when it loses she doesn ’ t pay her stake .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>That sounds very nasty of her . What makes you think it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I do it myself .... Poor Dickie , it ’ s going to cost him a lot of money this month .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Because whenever he goes out for the day I have to console myself by buying something . I generally choose something rather dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t remember that I advised that in the treatment of a volatile husband .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>No , I added it of my own accord .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>But why did you send for me to-day ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Because the end has come . And I can ’ t stand it any longer . This morning Dickie said that Mrs. Mack was well enough to be moved , and he was going to take her over to Paris to put her in the Riviera train .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Do you mean to say that ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With an angry shrug of the shoulders .</stage>Ada Fergusson wants a little jaunt in Paris .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>What are you going to do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m going to tell him he must choose between us . I ’ m going to do everything I can to prevent him from going . And I mean to let him know that if he goes it ’ s the end .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Oh !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t say oh ! Say I ’ m quite right . Say it ’ s the only thing to do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>But I think you ’ re quite wrong .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Wrong !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>You don ’ t suppose he wants to go to Paris . No man in his senses would take the risk .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Then why is he going ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Because she ’ s making him . And once a woman in these circumstances makes a man do what he doesn ’ t want to , it ’ s the beginning of the end .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>How d ’ you know ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t know . I guess it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>It seems to me that a lifetime spent in the study of mathematics has resulted in some very various knowledge .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Be a good girl , Pen , and let them go .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>There is a pause while PENELOPE , resting her face on her hands , looks straight at her father . She thinks the matter out .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>You were right when you said I should want a great deal of tact , and a great deal of patience , and a great deal of self-control . My word !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>Well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ll do nothing . I ’ ll hold my tongue , I ’ ll smile , I ’ ll make jokes , but ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Yes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I want some hats badly . I ’ ll just go and ring up Françoise and tell her to send me all she ’ s got in the shop .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DICKIE comes in .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>I was just going .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m sorry . Why so soon ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>I promised to fetch my wife .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>You must come back . This is the first time I ’ ve been separated from Dickie since our marriage , and I shall want to hide my head in the maternal bosom while my noble father pats my hand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I wish you wouldn ’ t take it so calmly , Pen . You might be a bit cut up .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>But , darling , I ’ m making every preparation to have fit after fit of violent hysterics . I can ’ t do more .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Rot me , that ’ s right .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With meaning .</stage>After all , Dickie , I know you wouldn ’ t go if you could help it . It ’ s only because you feel it ’ s your duty , isn ’ t it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DICKIE is rather uncomfortable , but says nothing . GOLIGHTLY breaks the momentary silence .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Why are you going by night ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Relieved .</stage>Oh , you see , there ’ s so much less of a crowd . It ’ s more convenient when you ’ re carting an invalid about .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gaily .</stage>It ’ ll be great fun , because you ’ ll see all the gay young men who are making a little excursion to Paris with the object of their affections . I ’ m told they always go by night so that no one should see them on the journey .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Well , I must be getting on or I shall be late . Au revoir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t be too long , father , in case my emotions get the better of me before you come back .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Nodding .</stage>I may see you later , Dickie .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out . PENELOPE makes as if to follow him .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m going upstairs to have tea .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rather stiffly .</stage>I ’ d like to have a little talk with you , Pen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Then come up into the drawing-room .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ d rather talk to you down here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sitting down .</stage>Very well . Talk .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>You can send for the tea if you like .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>No ; I ’ ll let it stand and ruin my digestion .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I can see they ’ re bills , thank you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Flourishing one of them .</stage>This is for the frock I ’ ve got on . You wouldn ’ t think it cost so much , would you ?<stage>Looking down at it .</stage>You see , you have to pay for the cut .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Trying to keep his temper .</stage>And what do you expect me to do with them ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Indifferently .</stage>You can put them in the waste-paper basket if you like , but it would be shorter to pay them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Flying into a passion .</stage>Now , look here , Pen . It ’ s perfectly preposterous . You know I ’ m not going to stand this sort of thing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Apparently much astonished , quite good-humouredly .</stage>Darling , you ’ re not going to make a scene for a few little things I ’ ve bought myself . I was positively in rags , and I thought you liked me to dress neatly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Hang it all , I ’ m a poor man , and you ’ ve spent more than a hundred and fifty pounds in this one month .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Calmly .</stage>Does it come to as much as that ? It ’ s lucky you ’ ve got such a good patient in Mrs. Mack , isn ’ t it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He gives her a suspicious look , but to get away from MRS. MACK breaks out angrily .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Senseless extravagance I call it . Now look here , here ’ s thirty-five pounds for a dress in blue cloth — absurd price to pay — on 9th of October .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Duke of York ’ s Stakes at Kempton .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>How d ’ you mean , Duke of York ’ s Stakes at Kempton ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I just happen to remember they were on that day because Madame Claude was so surprised to see me . It was only by the merest chance that she hadn ’ t gone to the races herself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>But what on earth put it into your head to go and buy a blue cloth dress ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sweetly .</stage>Well , you see , darling , it was the day of the first operation that was performed on Mrs. Mack . And you were away all day , and I felt awfully depressed and lonely . And I knew how anxious you were , and it made me anxious , so I just went and ordered a blue cloth to cheer myself up a bit .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DICKIE looks at her for a moment , then looks down at the bill , is about to speak , but says nothing . PENELOPE watches him .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Suddenly .</stage>And look here , on the 13th of October there ’ s an ermine stole and a muff .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , that was the second operation on poor Mrs. Mack .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I say , I think it ’ s a bit thick .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Well , I had to do something while you were away . And it made me feel so miserable to see everybody driving off with race glasses to Liverpool Street .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I beg your pardon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>You see , the 13th of October was the Cesarewitch .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>And I suppose all the others are to be explained in the same way .<stage>Looking at a bill .</stage>October 22 .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Sandown Races .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DICKIE looks through the bill crossly , but does not speak .</stage>
    <stage>Innocently . ] I wonder why you always had your operations on the same day as an important race meeting .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I suppose you think it odd ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>A little .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Well , it isn ’ t odd at all . It ’ s one of old Peter Marsden ’ s cranky ways . I told you it was Peter Marsden who did the operations , didn ’ t I ?<stage>PENELOPE nods .</stage>The fact is , he ’ s simply mad on racing . And he ’ s lost such a pot of money that he always fixes an important operation for the same day as a race meeting so that he absolutely won ’ t be able to go to it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Funny old thing .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DICKIE looks up suspiciously .</stage>
    <stage>With a laugh . ] Peter Marsden , not you , darling .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Now look here , Pen , we ’ ll say no more about these bills . I ’ ll pay them this time ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I knew you would .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>But there must be no more of them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I really don ’ t know why you should make such a fuss . After all , you ’ ve been earning simply heaps and heaps of money with Mrs. Mack .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>We mustn ’ t count our chickens before they ’ re hatched . I haven ’ t had a penny out of her yet .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>But now that she ’ s going away you can send in your bill .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I couldn ’ t possibly . It would kill her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t you think you might risk it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I think you ’ re awfully heartless , Pen . You forget that I ’ m very much attached to the old lady . I look upon her as a friend as well as a patient .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps she ’ ll leave you something in her will . We want a new electric brougham , don ’ t we ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I shouldn ’ t accept it . I have the strongest feeling against doctors getting legacies from their patients .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Well , you ’ ll be able to charge at least a hundred and fifty pounds for taking her to Paris .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a start .</stage>Pen !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , you made me jump .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>You ’ re not proposing to buy anything more ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Well , darling , I know that when I get up to-morrow morning and you ’ re not here , I shall feel dreadfully lonely and depressed .</p>
    </sp>

     <p><stage>Interrupting .</stage>Have your sainted mother to stay with you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>And it ’ s struck me that I simply haven ’ t got a hat I can wear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sternly .</stage>Penelope .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Persuasively .</stage>It ’ ll make my frocks last so much longer if I have some nice hats . You see , you ring the changes , and people think you have a new gown on .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>And may I venture to inquire how many hats you ’ ll want to overcome your depression ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Decidedly .</stage>Three .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I never heard anything so preposterous .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Now look here , Dickie , I ’ m willing to meet you half way ; I promise you they shan ’ t cost more than five pounds each . You can afford that out of the hundred and fifty .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>The fact is , Pen , that Mrs. Mack is more a friend than a patient , and she ’ s not so well to do as I thought . I ’ m proposing to make no charge for accompanying her to Paris .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quite firmly .</stage>Oh , no , Dickie , I won ’ t hear of it . You ’ ve got a wife to think of — if you died to-morrow I should be totally unprovided for . You have no right to be quixotic . It ’ s not fair to me .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DICKIE is just going to answer when PEYTON comes in .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEYTON</speaker>
     <p>A lady wishes to see you , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Irritably .</stage>At this hour ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEYTON</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s Mrs. Watson , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , yes , I know . Show her in .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Exit PEYTON .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Thank heaven , there ’ s somebody . I ’ ll get a few guineas out of her at all events .<stage>Looking at his case book .</stage>Four visits . That ’ ll be five guineas . By Jove , I want them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>What ’ s the matter with her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t know , but I ’ m pretending I do . And she probably won ’ t find out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ll leave you . I must just telephone to some one .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She goes out . DICKIE walks up and down irritably . When MRS. WATSON appears he at once puts on his professional manner , and is very bland and affable . MRS. WATSON is a little , old lady in black .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Well , Mrs. Watson ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. WATSON</speaker>
     <p>You mustn ’ t mind my coming so late . I know you don ’ t see any one after five , but I ’ m going away .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m delighted to see you . I promise you that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. WATSON</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I ’ m starting for the Riviera with my daughter to-morrow , and I thought</l>
      <l>I ’ d like to see you again before I went .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Of course . And how have you been getting on ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. WATSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>With the keenest satisfaction .</stage>Oh ! I don ’ t get on . I never get better .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Have you been taking your medicine regularly ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. WATSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Cheerfully .</stage>Yes ; but it doesn ’ t do me any good .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Let ’ s try your knee jerks , shall we ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MRS. WATSON crosses one leg over the other , and DICKIE taps below the knee ; the leg is slightly jerked up .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>That seems right enough .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. WATSON</speaker>
     <p>Sir Benjamin Broadstairs tried everything , and he couldn ’ t cure me ; and then I went to Sir William Wilson , and he told me not to do any of the things that Sir Benjamin Broadstairs told me to do , and I got worse and worse !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>You seem uncommonly cheerful about it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. WATSON</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve been to every doctor in London , and they all say I ’ m a wonderful case . I like being examined by doctors , and they take such an interest in me . The hours and hours they ’ ve spent over me . I can never be grateful enough for all the kindness I ’ ve had from them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s very nice of you to say so . I think I ’ ll try you on something else to-day .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. WATSON</speaker>
     <p>Oh ! make it nice and strong ; won ’ t you , doctor ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>You seem to like your medicine with some body in it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. WATSON</speaker>
     <p>Well , I like taking medicines . It ’ s something to do ; and now my daughter ’ s married I ’ m very much alone . I think I ’ ve taken every medicine in the Pharmacopœia , and they ’ ve none of them done me any good .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Handing her a prescription .</stage>Well , perhaps this will . You must take it three times a day before meals .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. WATSON</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Looking at it .</stage>
      <l>Oh ! but I ’ ve had this before , Dr. O ’ Farrell . Sir</l>
      <l>Arthur Thomas gave me this only a few months ago .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Well , try it again . Perhaps you didn ’ t give it a fair chance .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. WATSON</speaker>
     <p>I was reading in the Lancet the other day that a German doctor had discovered a new medicine which does nerve cases such a lot of good . I ’ m sure it ’ s the very thing for me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>What on earth were you reading the Lancet for ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. WATSON</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I always read the Lancet and the British Medical Journal . You see , my poor husband had to take them in for his practice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a gasp .</stage>You don ’ t mean to say your husband was a doctor ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. WATSON</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I thought I told you that I was a doctor ’ s widow .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DICKIE tries to master his agitation while MRS. WATSON prattles on .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. WATSON</speaker>
     <p>I can never bear to hear doctors spoken badly of . They never do me any good , but they ’ ve been kindness itself . I ’ ve only once been rudely treated , and that — if you ’ ll believe it — was by a mere nobody . I told him all my symptoms , and he said to me , Madam , can you eat ? Yes , I said . I have breakfast in the morning and a little soup at eleven o ’ clock ; and then I have lunch , and I always make a good tea , and I eat a little dinner at half-past seven , and before I go to bed I have some bread and milk . Then he said , Madam , can you sleep ? Yes , I said , for an old woman I sleep very well ; I sleep eight or nine hours regularly . Then he said , Madam , can you walk ? Oh ! yes , I said , I always make a point of walking four miles a day . Then he said , My opinion is that you ’ ve got nothing the matter with you at all . Good afternoon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Fancy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. WATSON</speaker>
     <p>Well , I just looked him up and down , and I said to him , Sir , your opinion is not shared by Sir Benjamin Broadstairs , or Sir William Wilson , or Sir Arthur Thomas . And I didn ’ t even offer him a fee , but I just swept out of the room .<stage>Archly .</stage>You won ’ t give me that new medicine ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Honestly , I don ’ t think it ’ s quite what you want .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. WATSON</speaker>
     <p>Very well . I expect you know best . And now I mustn ’ t take up any more of your time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sarcastically .</stage>Oh , it ’ s of no value , thank you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. WATSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Persuasively .</stage>Will you tell me what I owe you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , as a doctor ’ s widow , of course , I couldn ’ t dream of accepting a fee .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. WATSON</speaker>
     <p>That is kind of you . But you must allow me to give you a little present .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rather feebly , but brightening up a little .</stage>Oh , really , you know ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. WATSON</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve seen every doctor in London of any importance , and they ’ ve none of them charged me a penny , but I always make them a little present . I know that you doctors have to go out in all weathers , and you never wrap yourselves up . So I give them a woollen comforter .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She takes out of her bag a large red woollen comforter .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Blankly .</stage>Oh , thank you very much .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. WATSON</speaker>
     <p>I made it myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Did you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. WATSON</speaker>
     <p>And Sir Benjamin promised to wear his every winter . You ’ ll find it so warm .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m very grateful to you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. WATSON</speaker>
     <p>And now , good-bye , and thank you so much .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>When you come back from the Riviera , you might do worse than consult Dr. Rogers . He lives just at the other end of the street , you know . He ’ s very good in cases like yours .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. WATSON</speaker>
     <p>Thank you so much .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Good-bye .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She goes out , and he shuts the door . He runs to the other and calls out .</stage>
    <sp>

    </sp>
    <stage>MRS. WATSON enters .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. WATSON</speaker>
     <p>I knew there was something I wanted to ask you particularly , and I nearly forgot it . Sir Benjamin Broadstairs said I ought never to eat anything but toast , and Sir William Wilson said he didn ’ t think toast was at all good for me , and I only ought to eat bread . Now , I wonder what I had better do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Seriously , as if he were deliberating .</stage>Well , if I were you , I ’ d eat bread toasted only on one side .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. WATSON</speaker>
     <p>Thank you so much . Good-bye . I hope you ’ ll like the comforter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m sure I shall . Good-bye .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She goes out again , and DICKIE shuts the door .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Pen ! Pen !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PENELOPE comes in by the other door .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>What is the matter ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DICKIE goes up to her furiously with the comforter in his hands .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Look ! That ’ s my fee ! That !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s a woollen comforter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t be idiotic , Penelope . I can see it ’ s a woollen comforter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>But what ’ s the meaning of it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>She ’ s a doctor ’ s widow . Of course I couldn ’ t charge her anything . She kept it dark till to-day . I ’ ll tell you what , doctors ’ widows oughtn ’ t to be allowed to survive their husbands .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Oh !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>When you ’ re my widow , Pen , you go right up one side of Harley Street and then right down the other and see them all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>But supposing I ’ m not ill ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Hang it all , when you ’ ve lost me the least you can do is to enjoy indifferent health .</p>

    <stage>PEYTON comes in .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEYTON</speaker>
     <p>If you please , sir , Mrs. Watson says , may she just see you for one minute .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. WATSON</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve been thinking about what you said about toasting my bread on one side .... On which side shall I put the butter ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With his chin in his hand .</stage>H ’ m . H ’ m . You must put the butter on the toasted side .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. WATSON</speaker>
     <p>Oh , thank you . Now just one more question , do you think a little jam would hurt me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>No , I don ’ t think a little jam would hurt you , but you mustn ’ t put it on the same side as you put the butter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. WATSON</speaker>
     <p>Oh , thank you . Good afternoon . I ’ m so much obliged .</p>

     <p>Dickie , what are you talking about ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve been trying to think of it for ten minutes . That ’ s what doctors ’ widows ought to do — Suttee . Like the Hindoos .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Burn themselves alive at their husbands ’ death ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>You ’ ve hit it . Suttee . That ’ s the word .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>But , darling , I should hate to grace your funeral by making a bonfire of myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , you have no affection for me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Lots , but that ’ s asking a great deal , isn ’ t it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>No , you don ’ t care for me as much as you used to . You ’ re quite different . I ’ ve noticed lots of things .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a rapid glance at him , but keeping her chaffing manner .</stage>Oh , nonsense .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>You ’ ve changed lately . You never come down to see me off in the morning , and you don ’ t ask me at what time I ’ m coming back . You always used to sit on the arm of my chair after breakfast when I was smoking my pipe and reading the paper .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>You must have hated it , didn ’ t you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Of course I hated it , but it showed you were fond of me , and now that you don ’ t do it any more I miss it .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PEYTON comes in , followed by MRS. FERGUSSON , and withdraws .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEYTON</speaker>
     <p>Mrs. Fergusson .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DICKIE gives a slight start , and shows faint signs of annoyance . He cannot make out what MRS. FERGUSSON has come for .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>The maid told me you were here , so I asked her to show me straight in . I hope you don ’ t mind .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Of course not . We ’ re delighted to see you anywhere . Won ’ t you have some tea ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>No , thank you . The fact is , I ’ ve come to see Dr. O ’ Farrell professionally .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>You ’ re not ill ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve not been very well lately , and I thought I ’ d like to see a doctor .<stage>To DICKIE .</stage>Will you treat me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ll do anything I can for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>But it must be really a professional visit . You know , I want to pay .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , nonsense , Dickie couldn ’ t dream of accepting money from one of my friends .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>No , I ’ ve got the strictest principles on that point . I think it ’ s too bad of people to want a doctor to treat them for nothing . I really insist on paying the usual fee .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , well , we ’ ll discuss that later .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ll leave you alone , shall I ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Do you mind , dear ? It makes me a little uncomfortable to discuss my symptoms before a third party .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Of course .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>We shall only be five minutes .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>I ’ m sorry you ’ re seedy . You were all right yesterday .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laughing .</stage>I ’ ve never been better in my life , thank you .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DICKIE is rather taken aback .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s the advantage of you being a doctor . When I want to see you alone I can do it under your wife ’ s very nose . Don ’ t you think it was rather ingenious ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Dryly .</stage>Very .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She gives a little laugh . She gets up and steps cautiously to the door , and suddenly flings it open .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>What on earth are you doing ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>I wanted to see if Penelope was listening .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rather sharply .</stage>Of course she wasn ’ t listening . That ’ s about the last thing she ’ d do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Oh , my dear , don ’ t get in a temper about it . Lots of women do listen , you know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Do they ? I haven ’ t had the pleasure of meeting them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Fiddle .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Then will you tell me in what way I can be of use to you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Good-humouredly .</stage>Certainly not , if you ask me as crossly as that . You may kiss my hand .<stage>He does so .</stage>That ’ s right . Still cross ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Do you love me as much as ever ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>You wouldn ’ t say no if you didn ’ t , would you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Brute !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rather impatiently .</stage>I say , what on earth have you come for ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>You are nice to me to-day .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Well , when I left you yesterday we fixed up everything . I gave you your ticket , and I wrote down the time the train started .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Well , for one thing I wanted to see Penelope .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>It amuses me to see her simplicity . I get a lot of pleasure in looking at her and thinking how little she suspects what is going on under her very nose . She ’ s the most trusting person I ever met in my life .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>If you want to know anything , it makes me feel devilish uncomfortable .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>My poor , dear boy , what are you talking about ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>It wouldn ’ t be so bad if we had to take any precautions . But she trusts us absolutely . Why , she ’ s always throwing us together . It never enters her head that there can be the least reason for suspicion . It ’ s like knocking a man down who can ’ t defend himself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>I suppose that means that you no longer love me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Of course I love you . Good heavens , I ’ ve told you so till I ’ m blue in the face .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Oh , no , you no longer love me . Men only begin to have scruples when they stop caring for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DICKIE gives a sigh of resignation . This is not the first scene he has had to put up with .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve sacrificed everything for your sake . And now you insult me . And when I think of my poor husband bravely serving his country in a foreign land ! Oh , it ’ s cruel , cruel !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>But I ’ ve only said it made me feel low down to treat Penelope badly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>You don ’ t think of my feelings . You don ’ t think how I feel . What about my husband ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Well , you see I don ’ t happen to know your husband , and I do know my wife .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t be so stupid . Of course you know your wife .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s why I don ’ t like behaving like an utter cad .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>If you really loved me you would think of nothing but me , nothing , nothing , nothing .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She puts her handkerchief to her eyes .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I say , don ’ t cry .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>I shall cry . I ’ ve never been treated like this before . If you don ’ t love me any more , why don ’ t you say so ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I do love you . But ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>But what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Nervously .</stage>Well — er — I think it would be much better if we — put the trip to Paris off for a bit .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gasping with anger .</stage>Oh ! Oh ! Oh !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Penelope ’ s so blindly confident .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ll never speak to you again . I wish I had never met you . Oh , how can you insult me like this !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She begins to sob .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Lord ! Oh , Lord ! I say , don ’ t cry . I didn ’ t mean to be horrid . I ’ m awfully sorry .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He tries to take away her hands from her face .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t touch me . Don ’ t come near me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ll do anything you like if you won ’ t cry . I say , just think if Penelope came in — I was only thinking of the risk to you . Of course , there ’ s nothing I ’ d like so much as a jaunt over the Channel .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Is that true ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Do you really want me to come ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Of course I do , if you don ’ t mind the risk .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a smile .</stage>Oh , I ’ ll make that all right .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Why , what are you going to do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Wait a minute or two and you ’ ll see .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She is perfectly composed again , and in high good-humour .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>We might tell Penelope that we ’ re ready .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Very well .<stage>As DICKIE goes to the door .</stage>Oh , I quite forgot . I ’ ve simply got a head like a sieve .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>What ’ s the matter ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Well , I almost forgot the very thing I came to see you about . And all through you making a scene .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Did I make a scene ? I wasn ’ t aware of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>I want to ask you something . You won ’ t be angry , will you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I shouldn ’ t think so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Of course it ’ s nothing very important really , but it ’ s just a little awkward to ask .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , nonsense . Of course I ’ ll do anything I can .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Well , a friend of mine on the Stock Exchange gave me a splendid tip , and ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>It hasn ’ t come off . I know those splendid tips .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Oh , but it ’ s bound to be all right , only there are some differences to pay . I don ’ t quite understand what it all means , but Solly Abrahams ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Interrupting .</stage>Is that your friend on the Stock Exchange ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Yes , why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , nothing . Good old Scotch name , that ’ s all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Solly says I must send him a cheque for a hundred and eighty pounds .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DICKIE gives a slight start , and his face falls .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>And it ’ s just a little awkward for me to pay that just now . You see my income is always paid me half-yearly , and I really haven ’ t got a hundred and eighty pounds in the bank . I never borrow — it ’ s a thing I can ’ t bear — and I felt the only person I could come to now was you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m sure that ’ s awfully nice of you , not to say flattering .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>I knew you ’ d give it me at once , and , of course , I ’ ll pay you back out of my profits .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , that ’ s very good of you . I ’ ll see what I can do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Would it be too much trouble if I asked you to write out a cheque now ? It ’ ll be such a weight off my mind .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Of course . I ’ ll be only too glad . By the way , what are the shares called ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He sits down at his desk and writes a cheque .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Oh , it ’ s a gold mine . It ’ s called the Johannesburg and New Jerusalem .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>The name inspires confidence .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He gives her the cheque .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Thanks , so much . It ’ s awfully good of you . Now just write out a little prescription so as to have something to show Penelope .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>You forget nothing .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He writes .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>And I must give you a fee .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I wouldn ’ t bother about that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Oh yes , I insist . Besides , it makes it look so much more probable .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She looks in her purse .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Oh , how stupid of me ! I ’ ve only got a two-shilling bit in my purse . You don ’ t happen to have a couple of sovereigns on you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , yes , I think I have . The only money I ’ ve earned to-day .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He takes them out of his pocket and gives them to Mrs. Fergusson . She puts them on the desk with a two-shilling piece .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Thank you .... There . That looks a most imposing fee . You must leave it on there for Penelope to see .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Shall I call her ?</p>
    </sp>

     <p>I will .<stage>She goes to the door and calls .</stage>Penelope , we ’ ve quite done .</p>
    </sp>

     <p><stage>Hearing voices upstairs .</stage>Hulloa , there ’ s our Uncle Davenport .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I met him in the park the other day . He made himself so pleasant . He asked me if I was a Fergusson of Glengary . I didn ’ t know what he meant , but I said I was , and he seemed so pleased .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>You ’ d better not let him know you were a Miss Jones or he ’ ll have a fit .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I shall tell him I ’ m a Jones of Llandudno . I think that sounds rather smart .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>You have what one might politely describe as a remarkable power of invention .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>If I ’ d known what a reputation you had I wouldn ’ t have let you talk to me for half an hour in the park .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p><stage>Bubbling over with delight .</stage>Oh , you mustn ’ t listen to all you hear . A man who goes out as much as I do is sure to get talked about . Our world is so small and so censorious .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Dr. O ’ Farrell has been writing a prescription for me . I haven ’ t been very well lately .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I ’ m very sorry to hear that . You look the picture of health and extremely handsome .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Oh , you horrid cruel thing ! I wanted you to sympathise with me and tell me how ill I looked .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>If you will allow me to call on you I can promise to sympathise with you , but I ’ m afraid I shall never be able to tell you that you look anything but charming .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s too nice of you . You must come and see me the moment I get back from Paris .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DICKIE gives a start .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Are you going to Paris ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>I came on purpose to tell you . Really , I ’ ve got a head like a sieve . Poor Mrs. Mack has asked me if I would go as far as Paris with her . A most unfortunate thing has happened . Her maid ’ s mother has suddenly died , and the poor thing naturally wants to go to the funeral . And so ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Mrs. Mack has asked you to go in her maid ’ s place ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Only for two days , of course . Now , I want to know , dear , tell me honestly , do you mind ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Some women are so funny . I thought you mightn ’ t like the idea of my going with Dr. O ’ Farrell as far as Paris , and , of course , we shall be travelling back together .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>What nonsense ! Of course , I ’ m only too glad . It ’ ll be so nice for Dickie to have some one to travel with .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Then that settles it . I like to do everything above board , you know .</p>
    </sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Oh , that ’ s my fee . I insisted on paying a fee — I particularly want you to know that , Penelope — I ’ m so scrupulous about that sort of thing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , but Dickie can ’ t accept it .<stage>To DICKIE .</stage>You are a grasping old thing !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m sure I didn ’ t want the money .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>You really must take it back , Ada .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Putting up a defensive hand .</stage>No , I couldn ’ t really . It ’ s one of my principles .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I know your principles are excellent , but I really shouldn ’ t like Dickie to accept a fee for seeing my greatest friend .</p>

     <p>Oh , well , of course , if you take it like that , I don ’ t know what to do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Put it in your purse and say no more about it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Oh , it ’ s too good of you .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She puts it in her purse . DICKIE ’ S face falls as he sees his own money disappearing .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>And now I must really fly .<stage>Holding out her hand to BARLOW .</stage>Good-bye . Don ’ t forget to come and see me , but , remember , I shall expect to hear all about that little ballet-girl .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p><stage>Delighted to be thought so gay .</stage>You mustn ’ t ask me to be indiscreet .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>To PENELOPE .</stage>Good-bye , dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ll come to the door with you .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PENELOPE and MRS. FERGUSSON go out .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Going to the telephone .</stage>I don ’ t believe you ’ ve ever known a ballet-girl in your life .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>No , but it pleases women of our class to think one is hand and glove with persons of that profession .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Central 1234 . If they only knew that nine ballet-girls out of ten go home every night to their children and a husband in the suburbs ! I just want to ring up my broker . Is that you , Robertson ? I say , d ’ you know anything about a mine called the Johannesburg and New Jerusalem ? Rotten ? I thought as much . That ’ s all , thank you .<stage>He puts on the receiver — to himself , acidly .</stage>A hundred and eighty pounds gone bang .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Look here , Dickie , now that you have a moment to spare you might give me a little professional advice . Of course , I shan ’ t pay you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Good Lord ! I might as well be a hospital . I ’ m not even supported by voluntary contributions .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>The fact is , I ’ ve noticed lately that I ’ m not so thin as I was .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>It can ’ t have required great perspicacity to notice that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m not asking you for repartee , Dickie , but advice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>You don ’ t want to bother about a figure at your time of life .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>To tell you the truth , I have an inkling that I ’ ve made something of an impression on a very charming lady ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Interrupting .</stage>Take my advice and marry her quickly before the impression wears off .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Strange as it may appear to you , she ’ s a married woman .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Then don ’ t hesitate — do a bolt .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>What do you mean , Dickie ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>My dear Uncle Davenport , I ’ m young enough to be your son ; philandering with a married woman is the most exaggerated form of amusement that ’ s ever been invented . Take care ! That ’ s all I say . Take care !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>She ’ ll bind you hand and foot , and put a halter round your neck and lead you about by it . She ’ ll ask you ten times a day if you love her , and each time you get up to go away she ’ ll make a scene to force you to stay longer . Each time you put on your hat she ’ ll pin you down to the exact hour of your next visit .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>But all women do that . It only shows that they like you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I suppose all women do that — except Pen . Pen never bothers . She never asks you if you love her . She never keeps you when you want to get away . She never insists on knowing all your movements . And when you leave her she never asks that fatal , fiendish question , at what time will you be back ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Well , my boy , if my wife were as indifferent to me as that , I should ask myself who the other feller was .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>What the dickens do you mean by that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>My dear Dickie , it ’ s woman ’ s nature to be exacting . If she ’ s in love with you she ’ s always a nuisance , and a very charming nuisance too , to my mind . I like it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>You are not suggesting that Penelope ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Now , my dear boy , I didn ’ t come to talk to you about Penelope , but about my own health .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Impatiently .</stage>Oh , you ’ ve got chronic adiposity . That ’ s all that ’ s the matter with you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Good gracious me , that sounds very alarming . And what shall I do for it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Savagely , very quickly .</stage>Give up wines , spirits and liqueurs , bread , butter , milk , cream , sugar , potatoes , carrots , cauliflowers , peas , turnips , rice , sago , tapioca , macaroni , jam , honey , and marmalade .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>But that ’ s not treatment , that ’ s homicide !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taking no notice .</stage>Put on a sweater and run round the park every morning before breakfast . Let ’ s have a look at your liver .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>But , my dear Dickie ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Lie down on that sofa . Now don ’ t make a fuss about it . I ’ m not going to kill you .<stage>BARLOW lies down .</stage>Put your knees up .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p><stage>As DICKIE feels his liver .</stage>She ’ s a fine , dashing woman . There ’ s no doubt about that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Let yourself go quite loose . Who ’ s a fine , dashing woman ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Mrs. Fergusson .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DICKIE starts . He gives BARLOW a look , and then walks away , open-mouthed .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Dickie , Dickie .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Much alarmed he gets off the sofa .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Is my liver very wrong ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Completely abstracted .</stage>It ’ s in a beastly state . I thought it would be .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p><stage>In tragic tones .</stage>Richard , tell me the worst at once .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Impatiently .</stage>Don ’ t be such an old donkey . Your liver ’ s as right as mine is . There ’ s nothing the matter with you except that you do yourself too well , and don ’ t take enough exercise .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p><stage>With unction .</stage>I suppose one has to pay for being the most popular diner-out of one ’ s time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking at him sharply .</stage>Is it on Mrs. Fergusson that you ’ ve made something of an impression ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p><stage>With great self-satisfaction .</stage>My dear fellow , I am the last man to give a woman away .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Ah !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Between ourselves , Dickie , do you think Mrs. Fergusson would find it peculiar if I asked her to lunch with me tête-à-tête at the Carlton ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Peculiar ! She ’ d jump at it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Do you think her husband would mind ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , her husband ’ s all right . He keeps on bravely serving his country in a foreign land .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>It shows that she has a nice nature , or she wouldn ’ t have come to ask</l>
      <l>Penelope if she minded your going to Paris together .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , she has a charming nature .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Lucky dog , I wish I were going to Paris with her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Fervently .</stage>I wish you were .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Ha , ha . Well , well , I must be running away . I ’ m dining out as usual . These good duchesses , they will not leave me alone . Good-bye .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out . DICKIE walks up and down the room thinking . In a moment PENELOPE puts her head in .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I say , darling , oughtn ’ t you to be packing ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Come in and let ’ s smoke a cigarette together .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>All right .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She takes a cigarette , which he lights for her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I hope you ’ ll have a splendid time in Paris .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She sits down .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>You never sit on the arm of my chair as you used to .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m horribly afraid I ’ m growing middle-aged . I ’ ve discovered how much more comfortable it is to have a chair of my own .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Trying to hide a slight embarrassment .</stage>Weren ’ t you rather surprised when Mrs. Fergusson told you she was going to Paris to-night ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Surprised ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PENELOPE gives a little gurgle , tries to stifle it but cannot , then , giving way , bursts into peal upon peal of laughter . DICKIE watches her with increasing astonishment .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>What on earth are you laughing at ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Bubbling over .</stage>Darling , you must think me an old silly . Of course , I knew you were going together .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Thoroughly startled .</stage>I don ’ t know what you ’ re talking about .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I have tried not to see anything , but you do make it so difficult .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Making up his mind to be very haughty .</stage>Will you have the goodness to explain yourself ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>My dear , of course I know all about it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I entirely fail to gather your meaning . What do you know all about ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>About you and Ada , silly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Very haughtily .</stage>Penelope , do you mean to say you suspect me of ...?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With an affectionate smile .</stage>Darling !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Suddenly alarmed .</stage>What d ’ you know ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Everything .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He gives a gasp and looks at PENELOPE anxiously .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve been so amused to watch you during the last two months .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Amused ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Upon my word , it ’ s been as good as a play .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quite at a loss .</stage>Have you known all along ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>My dear , didn ’ t you see that I did everything in the world to throw you together ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>But I assure you there ’ s not a word of truth in it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Good-humouredly .</stage>Come , come , Dickie !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>But why haven ’ t you said anything ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I thought it would only embarrass you . I didn ’ t mean to say anything to-day , but I couldn ’ t help laughing when you asked me if I was surprised .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Aren ’ t you angry ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Angry ? What about ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Aren ’ t you jealous ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Jealous ? You must think me a little donkey .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>You took it as a matter of course ? It amused you ? It was as good as a play ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Darling , we ’ ve been married for five years . It ’ s absurd to think there could be anything between us after all that time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , is it ? I wasn ’ t aware of that fact .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>The whole thing seemed to me of no importance . I was pleased to think you were happy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Flying into a passion .</stage>
      <l>Well , I think it ’ s positively disgraceful ,</l>
      <l>Penelope .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , my dear , don ’ t exaggerate . It was a harmless peccadillo .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m not talking of my behaviour , but of yours .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Mine ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , scandalous I call it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quite disappointed .</stage>And I thought it was so tactful .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Tactful be blowed . You must be entirely devoid of any sense of decency .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>My dear , I haven ’ t done anything .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s just it . You ought to have done something . You ought to have kicked up a row ; you ought to have made scenes ; you ought to have divorced me . But just to sit there and let it go on as if it were nothing at all ! It ’ s too monstrous .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I ’ m awfully sorry . If I ’ d known you wanted me to make a scene of course</l>
      <l>I would have , but really it didn ’ t seem worth making a fuss about .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ve never heard anything so callous , anything so cold-blooded , anything so cynical .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>You are difficult to please .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>But don ’ t you realise that I ’ ve treated you abominably .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , no , you ’ ve always been the best and most discreet of husbands .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>No , I ’ ve been a bad husband . I ’ m man enough to acknowledge it . And I mean to turn over a new leaf , Penelope ; I will give Ada up . I promise you never to see her again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Darling , why should you cause her needless pain ? After all , she ’ s an old friend of mine . I think the least I can expect is that you should treat her nicely .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>D ’ you mean to say you want it to go on ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s an arrangement that suits us all three . It amuses you , Ada has some one to take her about , and I get a lot of new frocks .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Frocks ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , you see , I ’ ve been consoling my aching heart by replenishing my wardrobe .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>So you ’ re willing to sacrifice our whole happiness to your frocks . Oh , I ’ ve cherished a viper in my bosom . I may have acted like a perfect beast , but , hang it all , I do know what ’ s right and wrong . I have a moral sense .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>It seems to have displaced your sense of humour .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Do you know that all these weeks I ’ ve been tortured with remorse ? I ’ ve told myself every day that I was treating you shamefully , I ’ ve not had a moment ’ s happiness . I ’ ve lived on a perfect rack .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>It doesn ’ t seem to have had any serious effect on your health .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>And here have you been laughing up your sleeve all the time . It can ’ t go on .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Upon my word , I don ’ t see why not ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>We ’ ve been mistaken in one another . I ’ m not the man to stand such a position with indifference . And I ’ ve been mistaken in you , Penelope . I thought you cared for me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I dote upon you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s a jolly nice way of showing it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s just what I thought it was .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>You ’ ve outraged all my better nature .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Then what do you propose to do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m going to do the only possible thing . Separate .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hearing voices in the hall .</stage>Here are papa and mamma . They said they were coming back .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I hope they ’ ll never find out what a wicked , cruel woman you are . It would send down their grey hairs in sorrow to the grave .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>But , my dear , they know all about it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>What ! Is there any one who doesn ’ t know ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>We didn ’ t tell Uncle Davenport . He ’ s such a man of the world , he has no sense of humour .</p>

    <stage>PEYTON comes in to announce the GOLIGHTLYS , then goes out .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEYTON</speaker>
     <p>Professor and Mrs. Golightly .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The GOLIGHTLYS come in .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Kissing MRS. GOLIGHTLY .</stage>Well , mother ... Papa , Dickie wants to separate from me because I won ’ t divorce him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>That doesn ’ t sound very logical .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>What has happened ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Nothing ’ s happened . I can ’ t make out why Dickie ’ s so cross .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Indignantly .</stage>Nothing !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I didn ’ t mean to say anything about it , but Dickie found out that we knew all about his little love affair .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>My dear , how tactless of you ! A man likes to keep those things from his wife .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>And d ’ you know the attitude Penelope takes up ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>She hasn ’ t been making a scene ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s just it . Any woman of feeling would make a scene . There must be something radically wrong about her , or she would have wept and stamped and torn her hair .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Mildly .</stage>Oh , my dear boy , don ’ t you exaggerate the enormity of your offence ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>There are no excuses for me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>It was a mere trifle . It would show a lamentable want of humour in</l>
      <l>Penelope if she took it seriously .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>D ’ you mean to say you agree with her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>My dear fellow , we ’ re in the twentieth century .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh ! Mrs. Golightly , you spend your time in converting the heathen . Don ’ t you think your own family needs some of your attention ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PENELOPE , unseen by DICKIE , makes a face at MRS. GOLIGHTLY to induce her to keep up the scene .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>A long acquaintance with savage races has led me to the conclusion that man is naturally a polygamous animal .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>My brain reels .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>I confess I was relieved to hear it was a married woman . It seems to make it so much more respectable .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>It appears to me I ’ m the only moral man here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Dickie , darling , I haven ’ t been having an affair with the policeman .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I wish you had . I wouldn ’ t have treated you like this .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I thought of it , but I didn ’ t like the colour of his moustache .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I know I ’ m to blame . I ’ ve behaved like a perfect brute .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , nonsense .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t contradict , Penelope . I ’ m thoroughly ashamed of myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Come , come !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I repeat , there are no excuses for me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Poor fellow , he seems quite cut up .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I haven ’ t a leg to stand on , but , by Jove , I ’ ve got a moral sense , and I tell you all that I ’ m simply outraged . You ’ re overthrowing the foundations of society . Whatever I ’ ve done , I ’ ve got more respect for the sanctity of the home and the decencies of family life than all of you put together .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He flings towards the door , stops , and turns round to shake his fist at them .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>A moral sense . That ’ s what I ’ ve got .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out , slamming the door behind him .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a laugh .</stage>Poor darling .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>What on earth made you blurt it all out ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>She came here to-day , and I saw that he was sick to death of her .... Mamma , you behaved like a heroine of romance .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>I shall never forgive myself for the dreadful things you ’ ve made me say .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , yes , you will , mother . Fast an extra day all through next Lent . It ’ ll be equally good for your soul and for your figure .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Penelope !</p>

     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Take care .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DICKIE bursts violently into the room .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I say , what are these two confounded women doing in the hall ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>What women ? Oh , I know ....<stage>She goes to the door .</stage>Please come in . They ’ re from Françoise . The Modiste .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The girls come in , laden with hat boxes .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>You told me I might get a hat or two to console myself for your trip to</l>
      <l>Paris .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Very nice of you , Dickie . That shows you haven ’ t a selfish nature .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PENELOPE makes another face at her mother .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>You ’ ve never given me a free hand to buy hats , Charles .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>On the other hand , I ’ ve never taken little jaunts to Paris without you , my dear .</p>

     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Some women are so lucky in their husbands .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Meanwhile the girls have been taking hats out , and PENELOPE puts one on . She is perfectly delighted .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , isn ’ t this a dream ?<stage>Looking at the other .</stage>Oh ! oh ! Did you ever see anything so lovely ? Dickie , you are a dear . I ’ m so glad you ’ re going to Paris .</p>

     <stage>SCENE : PENELOPE ’ S boudoir . It is an attractive room , furnished with bright-coloured chintzes , and gay with autumn flowers and great bunches of leaves . There is a large looking-glass . It is a room to live in , and there are books and magazines scattered about . Photographs of DICKIE in every imaginable attitude .</stage>
     <stage>PEN , in a ravishing costume , is alone , standing in the middle of the room . She looks at herself in the glass and turns right round , smiling with satisfaction . She preens herself . Suddenly she sees something she does not quite like ; she frowns a little , then she makes a face at herself , solemnly and elaborately curtsies , and gaily throws herself a kiss .</stage>

     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Sit down , mamma , and get your breath back , because I ’ m just going to take it away again .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>It sounds hardly worth while .</p>

     <p>Is that all ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>But it ’ s the most surprising , exquisite , wonderful thing in the world , and I ’ m in the seventh heaven of delight .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>But has he told you so ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , no , we ’ re not on speaking terms at present .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Ah , I suppose you express your mutual affection in dumb show .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>He went out immediately after you left last night , and didn ’ t come home till past twelve . I heard him stop at my door , so I huddled myself under the bed-clothes and pretended to be fast asleep , but I just let my hand drop carelessly over one side of the bed . Then he gave a tiny little knock , and as I didn ’ t answer he came in , and he crept up on tip-toe , and he looked at me as if — as if he ’ d like to eat me up .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Penelope , you ’ re romancing . How on earth could you know that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Putting her finger at the back of her head .</stage>I saw him through the back of my head — there . And then he bent down and just touched my hand with his lips .<stage>Showing her hand to GOLIGHTLY .</stage>Look , that ’ s where he kissed it — just on the knuckle .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gravely looking at her hand .</stage>It seems to have left no mark .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t be silly . And then he crept softly out again , and I had the first really good sleep I ’ ve had for a month . And this morning I had my breakfast in bed , and when I got up he ’ d gone out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>You haven ’ t seen him to-day at all ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>No , he didn ’ t come in to luncheon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Well , Charles , I ’ m grateful that you never showed your passion for me by keeping systematically out of my way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>But , my dear , it ’ s so simple . Of course , he ’ s in a dreadful temper . I ’ ve made him feel a perfect fool , and he hates it . But , good heavens ! after five years I know how to deal with him when I ’ ve hurt his pride . I ’ ll just give him a chance of saving his face , and then we ’ ll fall into one another ’ s arms and be happy ever afterwards .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>GOLIGHTLY , who has been sitting near a table , draws a sheet of paper towards him and begins , meditatively , to write .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>But , darling , don ’ t waste the precious hours , do it at once .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>No , I ’ m wiser than that . I ’ m not going to do anything till Ada Fergusson is quite disposed of .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Has anything been seen of her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>No , but I expect her here every minute .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a gasp .</stage>Here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>She rang up last night and spoke<stage>imitating a man ’ s tones</stage>in a deep voice , like this , so that I shouldn ’ t recognise her . She asked if Dickie was at home , and I said he wasn ’ t .<stage>Imitating the man ’ s voice again .</stage>Will you ask him to ring up Mrs. Mack as soon as he comes back ? Oh ! I said , I think he ’ s been at Mrs. Mack ’ s all the evening , and I rang off quickly . And this morning I just took the receiver off , and I think by now Ada must be in a pretty temper .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She catches sight of GOLIGHTLY and goes up to look at what he is writing .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Tapping the table sharply with her open hand .</stage>Two and two don ’ t make five , father .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>I never said they did , darling .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Then why are you writing it down ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>You seem to think they do , my dear ; and I have the highest respect for your intelligence .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Mamma , if you thought it absolutely necessary to provide a father for your offspring , I wish you had chosen one who wasn ’ t quite so irritating .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>GOLIGHTLY does not answer , but quietly adds two and two together . PENELOPE watches him for a moment .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>D ’ you think I ’ m a perfect fool , father ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Yes , my dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>You ’ re preparing for Dickie once more an uninterrupted diet of strawberry ices .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PENELOPE goes up to her father and sits down opposite to him . She takes the pencil out of his hand .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Put that down , father , and tell me what you ’ re talking about .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Joining his hands and leaning back in his chair .</stage>How are you going to keep your husband ’ s love now you have got it back ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a nod and a smile .</stage>I ’ m never going to bore him with demonstrations of affection . I ’ m never going to ask him if he loves me . And when he goes out I ’ m never going to inquire at what time he ’ ll be back .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Calmly .</stage>And what will you do when the next pretty little grass-widow throws herself at his head ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rather outraged at the mere thought .</stage>I hope he ’ ll duck and dodge her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a deprecating shrug of the shoulders .</stage>Your mother , from her unrivalled knowledge of heathen races , has told you that man is naturally a polygamous animal .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>I shall never forgive myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Do you mean to say I ’ m to expect Dickie to have flirtations with half a dozen different women ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>I only see one way to avoid it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>And what is that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Be half a dozen different women yourself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>It sounds dreadfully exhausting .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Remember that man is by nature a hunter . But how the dickens can he pursue if you ’ re always flinging yourself in his arms ? Even the barndoor hen gives her lawful mate a run for his money .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>It was so easy for me to love , honour , and obey him , and so delightful . It never struck me that I ought to keep watch over my feelings .</p>

     <p>We all strive for happiness , but what would happiness be if it clung to us like a poor relation ?</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a smile .</stage>Well , you made your love too cheap , my dear . You should have let your husband beg for it , and you made it a drug in the market . Dole out your riches . Make yourself a fortress that must be freshly stormed each day . Let him never know that he has all your heart . He must think always that at the bottom of your soul there is a jewel of great price that is beyond his reach .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Do you mean to say that I must be always on my guard ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>A wise woman never lets her husband be quite , quite sure of her . The moment he is —<stage>with a shrug of the shoulders</stage>— Cupid puts on a top-hat and becomes a churchwarden .</p>

     <p>That is a question only you can answer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I suppose you mean it depends on how much I love Dickie .<stage>A pause . Tremulously .</stage>I love him with all my heart , and if I can keep his love everything is worth while .<stage>She rests her face on her hands , and looks straight in front of her . Her voice is filled with tears .</stage>But , oh , father , why can ’ t we go back to the beginning when we loved one another without a thought of wisdom or prudence ? That was the real love . Why couldn ’ t it last ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Tenderly .</stage>Because you and Dickie are man and woman , my dear .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>

     <p>Scylla and Charybdis . The price they pay is satiety . Would you rather have the placid indifference of nine couples out of ten , or at the cost of a little trouble and a little common sense keep Dickie loving you passionately to the end of his days ?</p>

     <p>She has had an affair with the Additional Curates ’ Society , and an intrigue with the English Church Mission .

     <p>My dear , a merciful providence has given you roguish eyes and a sharp tongue . Make use of them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p>Charles , I shall be thankful when you return to your mathematics . The morals of that hussy X are already so bad that you can ’ t make them much worse .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>The fact is , papa , that as a guide for the young you have rather advanced views .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GOLIGHTLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a grotesque , dramatic flourish .</stage>Ungrateful child ! And I , like the pelican , have offered you my very heart to dine on .</p>

    <stage>DICKIE , rather puzzled at this , gives PENELOPE a quick look .</stage>

     <p>We can find our way out . Don ’ t bother about Peyton .</p>
    </sp>

    </sp>
    <stage>The GOLIGHTLYS go out . PENELOPE , with a slight smile , lies down on the sofa and takes up a magazine . She pays no attention to DICKIE . He gives her a sidelong glance and arranges his tie in the glass . PEYTON comes in .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking up from her magazine .</stage>Oh , Peyton , you might pack up some things for me in that little flat portmanteau of the doctor ’ s . Put my green charmeuse in .</p>

     <p>Very well , ma ’ am .</p>

     <p><stage>Stiffly .</stage>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>How stupid of me ! You see , I was expecting you to spend two or three days in Paris with Ada , and I arranged to motor down to Cornwall with the Hendersons .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>But I gave up the trip to Paris so as not to annoy you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>It wouldn ’ t have annoyed me a bit , darling .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>It ought to have annoyed you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>In any case I ’ m afraid I can ’ t throw the Hendersons over . They ’ ve made up a little partie carrée so that we can play bridge in the evenings .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DICKIE goes up to PEN and sits on the sofa beside her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>

    </sp>

     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Well , if I were you , I ’ d do neither .</p>

     <p>You generally start off for Mrs. Mack ’ s about now .</p>

     <p><stage>Jumping off the sofa .</stage>Dead ! When ’ s the funeral ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>The date hasn ’ t been settled yet .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Well , now you ’ ll be able to send in your bill .</p>
    </sp>

     <p><stage>Nervously .</stage>Pen , Mrs. Mack never existed .</p>

     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a smile .</stage>I never thought she did , darling .</p>

     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>What !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PENELOPE giggles .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>D ’ you mean to say you knew all the time that I ’ d invented her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I thought it was very nice of you to make up a plausible excuse for being away so much .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Then , when you bought all those things because I was making such a pot of money , you were just pulling my leg .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a smile .</stage>Well ....</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DICKIE suddenly bursts into a shout of laughter .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>When he recovers .</stage>I say , you have scored us off . Upon my soul , you are a wonderful little woman . I can ’ t think how I ever saw anything in Ada Fergusson .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , but I think she ’ s charming .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>What nonsense ! You know you don ’ t . If you only knew the life she led me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I suppose she often asked you if you really loved her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Ten times a day .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>And when you left her , did she want to know exactly at what time you ’ d come back ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>How did you know ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I guessed it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Going towards her as if to take her in his arms .</stage>Oh , Pen , let ’ s forget and forgive .</p>

    </sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I was feeling awfully conscience-stricken .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s where women have such an advantage over men . Their conscience never strikes them till they ’ ve lost their figure and their complexion .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Stopping .</stage>I say , what are you running round the room for in that ridiculous fashion ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I thought we were playing touch-last .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t be a little beast , Pen . You know you love me , and I simply dote upon you .... I can ’ t do more than I have done .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>What d ’ you want me to do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I want you to kiss and make friends .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quite good-naturedly .</stage>I think you ’ re a little previous , aren ’ t you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I suppose you ’ re thinking of Ada Fergusson .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I confess she hadn ’ t entirely slipped my mind .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Hang Ada Fergusson !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I think that ’ s rather drastic punishment . After all , she did nothing but succumb to your fatal fascination .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s right , put all the blame on me . As if it were men who made the running on these occasions ! I never want to see her again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>How changeable you are .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Going towards her eagerly .</stage>I ’ m never going to change again . I ’ ve had my lesson , and I ’ m going to be good in future .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , but you might help me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>You don ’ t want me by any chance to tell Ada Fergusson that you don ’ t care for her any more ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s a devilish awkward thing to say oneself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I can imagine that the best-tempered woman would take it a little amiss .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I say , can ’ t you suggest something to help me out ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a shrug of the shoulders .</stage>My dear , since the days of Ariadne there ’ s only been one satisfactory way of consoling a deserted maiden .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a jump .</stage>Uncle Davenport !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>What about Uncle Davenport ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>He told me yesterday he thought she was a devilish fine woman .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , no , Dickie , I ’ m not going to allow you to sacrifice my only uncle .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ll just ring him up and tell him she ’ s not gone to Paris .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>No , Dickie . No , Dickie . No , Dickie !</p>

     <p><stage>Acidly .</stage>It is the first time I have put it on .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , then I suppose I ’ ve seen one just like it on other people .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>You ’ ll think I ’ m coming here a great deal , dearest .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Is Dr. O ’ Farrell at home ? I wanted to ask him something about the medicine he prescribed for me yesterday .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Now don ’ t say you ’ ve come to see Dickie . I was hoping you ’ d come to see me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>I wanted to kill two birds with one stone .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>That is a feat of marksmanship which always gives one satisfaction .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>I forget if you said that Dr. O ’ Farrell was at home .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>You know , I think you must be the only person who ’ s known him ten minutes without calling him Dickie .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>I should have no confidence in him as a doctor if I did .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I never employ him myself . I always go to Dr. Rogers .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>You look as if you had robust health , dearest .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I just manage to trip along above ground to save funeral expenses .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Is Dr. O ’ Farrell quite well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Wondering why .</stage>Oh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>A slight pause .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>I suppose you haven ’ t the least idea when he ’ ll be home ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I didn ’ t know he was out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I beg your pardon . I thought you said he was out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>I must have misunderstood you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I think he ’ s lying down . You see he was with poor Mrs. Mack till twelve o ’ clock last night .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a slight start .</stage>Was he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s so bad that she should have had a relapse when she seemed to be going on so well .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Puzzled , but trying not to show it .</stage>I was more distressed than I can say .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>And it must have been so inconvenient for you after you ’ d made all your arrangements for going to Paris .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Oh , of course , I didn ’ t think of my convenience at all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Dickie says the way you ’ ve nursed her is beyond all praise .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>I think in this life we ought to do what we can for one another . I only did my duty .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>So few of us do that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>When I think of my husband bravely serving his country in a foreign land , I feel that I ought to do anything I can to help others .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PENELOPE meditatively winks to herself .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Were you there at the end ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Astounded .</stage>What end ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>You don ’ t mean to say you don ’ t know ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Penelope , I haven ’ t an idea what you ’ re talking about .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>But Dickie was with Mrs. Mack all this morning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>That ’ s absurd .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I wonder you weren ’ t sent for .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>But ....</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She is speechless with anger and amazement .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Then you really don ’ t know ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Desperately .</stage>I know nothing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>My poor , dear Ada . I ’ m distracted that I should have to give you this bitter , bitter blow . Mrs. Mack is — dead .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Dead !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>She died in Dickie ’ s arms , thanking him for all he ’ d done for her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Impossible !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t wonder you say that . She was quite frisky a day or two ago .... Sit down , dear . You ’ re quite upset . You were very fond of her , weren ’ t you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Dead !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Why don ’ t you have a good cry ? Can ’ t you find your handkerchief ? Take this . It ’ s very sad , isn ’ t it ? And after all you ’ d done for her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MRS. FERGUSSON dabs her eyes with the handkerchief .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Forcing herself to be natural .</stage>It ’ s a great blow .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I know . I feel for you , dear . Dickie was devoted to her . He said he ’ d never had such a patient .<stage>Putting her handkerchief to her own eyes .</stage>She died , with a smile on her lips , mentioning her dead husband ’ s name . Dickie was so moved , he couldn ’ t eat any lunch , poor boy ; and we ’ re going to have a new landaulette .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DICKIE comes in and stops at the door for a moment as he sees the two women apparently in tears .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I say , what ’ s up ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>What news ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>She didn ’ t know that Mrs. Mack was — no more .</p>

     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Trying to conceal her rage and mystification .</stage>I certainly didn ’ t !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>You ought to have let her know , Dickie . She would have liked to be — in at the death .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I wanted to spare you .</p>

     <p>That ’ s just what I said . Murmuring the name of her husband , who ’ d been dead for forty years . What did you say the name was , Dickie ?</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Walker , darling .</p>

     <p>Good heavens ! You made me positively jump .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>What does all this mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>It means that Mrs. Mack , like the rest of us , is mortal . The funeral takes place the day after to-morrow at Kensal Green . Friends kindly accept this the only intimation .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>How can Mrs. Mack be dead ? You know just as well as I do that she never existed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Upon my word , I ’ m beginning to be not quite certain . I ’ ve talked about her so much that she seems much more real than — than my bank balance , for instance . And I could write a beautiful article for the Lancet on the case .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Furiously .</stage>Oh !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>After all , she did have a rotten time of it , poor old lady . Operation after operation . Life wasn ’ t worth living . She was bound to die . And I call it a jolly happy release .</p>

     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Where were you last night ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I was at Mrs. Mack ’ s — no , of course , I wasn ’ t . I ’ m so used to saying that that it slips out quite naturally . I ’ m awfully sorry .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>How can you tell me such lies ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t know . I suppose it ’ s growing into a habit .</p>

     <p>I recommend you to keep them for Penelope .</p>

     <p>What d ’ you mean by saying , I see ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>It was the only reply I could think of at the moment .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m sure you meant something by it .</p>

FERGUSSON does not answer , and after a moment ’ s pause he goes on .</stage>The fact is , I ’ m not built the proper way for intrigue . All these lies make me awfully uncomfortable . I don ’ t like to think I ’ m treating Penelope badly .<stage>Another pause .</stage>I may as well tell you the whole truth bang out . I ’ ve discovered that I ’ m desperately in love with Penelope .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Calmly .</stage>And ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rather surprised .</stage>And that ’ s all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>And how do you imagine that interests me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Quite embarrassed .</stage>I thought — er ....</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MRS. FERGUSSON goes into a peal of laughter . DICKIE , quite taken aback , looks at her with astonishment .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>You haven ’ t been under the impression that I ever cared for you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Trying to make it out .</stage>No , no . Of course a man ’ s a conceited ass who thinks a woman ’ s in love with him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>You amused me when I first met you , but you ’ ve long ceased to do that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s kind of you to say so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>It was convenient to have some one to do things for me . I ’ m a womanly woman and ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>You don ’ t know your way about .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>For the last month you ’ ve bored me to extinction . I ’ ve done everything in my power to show you except say it right out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m afraid I ’ ve been very dense .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Dreadfully dense .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>But it was good of you to spare my feelings .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>With an amiable smile .</stage>D ’ you think it would be rude if I described you in your own words as a conceited ass ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>It might make our future acquaintance rather formal .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>There will be no future acquaintance .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Then there ’ s nothing more to be said .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MRS. FERGUSSON sweeps to the door . She stops .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Does Penelope adore you as blindly as when first I met you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I venture to think she ’ s as much in love with me as I am with her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>What have you done with the letters I wrote to you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I did as we agreed . I burnt them at once .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>I didn ’ t . I kept yours .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I shouldn ’ t have thought they were interesting enough .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>I have an idea that Penelope would find them positively absorbing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Why don ’ t you send them to her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>If you have no objection , I think I will .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>They will tell her nothing that she doesn ’ t know already .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coming back , startled .</stage>You don ’ t mean to say you ’ ve told her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Of course not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>She ’ s known it all along .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Known what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Everything . From the beginning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Terrified .</stage>How did she find out ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Heaven only knows .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s a trap ! I might have known she wasn ’ t such a fool as she seemed . She wants to divorce you , and she ’ s used me . My husband will never stand that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I can imagine that even the most affectionate husband would draw the line there .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Oh , don ’ t try and be funny now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I wasn ’ t . The funny part is yet to come .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>What ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Well , you needn ’ t get into a state about it . Penelope ’ s not going to do anything .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>But then , why ...?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a shrug of the shoulders .</stage>She doesn ’ t care a hang .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t understand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Don ’ t you ? It ’ s very simple . It ’ s a matter of no importance . She ’ s glad that I ’ ve been amused . If she only knew how much amusement I ’ ve got out of it ! She looks upon it in the light of a — of a change of air .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Furiously .</stage>Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! A fortnight ’ s golf at the seaside , I suppose .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Something like that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>I ’ d sooner she divorced you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Thanks , I wouldn ’ t .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Oh , what a humiliation ! I ’ ve been just a convenience because she had other fish to fry . How sordid it makes the whole thing ! And I was yearning for romance . I would never have looked at you if I hadn ’ t thought she doted on you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I have an idea that affairs of this sort are only romantic when they happen to other people . When they happen to yourself — well , sordid ’ s just the word .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Suddenly remembering .</stage>And Mrs. Mack ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>She ’ s known all about that too .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>D ’ you mean that to-day when we ...?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Mingled your tears ? I think hers were about as real as yours .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>And she led me on to say one thing after another .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I think she ’ s been pulling both our legs successfully .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>How on earth am I going to meet her now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>She ’ ll be all right . She ’ ll be just as charming as ever .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>You fool ! Don ’ t you see that if she ’ s charming to me it ’ s because she thinks she ’ s prettier than I am , and cleverer than I am , and more fascinating than I am ? She doesn ’ t even despise me , she ’ s indifferent to me .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She goes to the glass and looks at herself .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Furiously .</stage>A change of air .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The door opens slowly , and PENELOPE comes in . She has changed into motoring things . MRS. FERGUSSON gives a sudden gasp as she sees her and turns her face away . For a moment PENELOPE stands still , looking at them reflectively . DICKIE aimlessly arranges things on a table .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a faint smile .</stage>I ’ m not disturbing you , am I ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Er ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Yes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Nothing .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Suddenly , with a sob , MRS. FERGUSSON sinks into a chair , and hiding her face bursts into tears . PENELOPE gives her a look of surprise and goes swiftly up to her . She leans over her , with her hand on MRS. FERGUSSON ’ S shoulder .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Almost tenderly .</stage>What ? Real tears ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a broken voice .</stage>I feel so ridiculous .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a little smile , as if she were talking to a child .</stage>Don ’ t . Don ’ t cry .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>I look such a perfect fool .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s so tiresome of our little sins to look foolish when they ’ re found out , instead of wicked .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>I shall never respect myself again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Dry your tears , dear . Uncle Davenport has just come , and he wants to know if it ’ s respectable to ask you to lunch with him alone .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a suspicion of her old manner .</stage>He ’ s so sympathetic . I ’ d like to have a heart-to-heart talk with him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>You ’ ll find the Carlton a most suitable place .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Are my eyes red ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Not a bit . I ’ ll get you some powder .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She takes the powder-box off a table , and MRS. FERGUSSON meditatively powders her nose .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>I like him . He talks of all the duchesses by their Christian names .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PEYTON announces BARLOW and goes out .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEYTON</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Davenport Barlow .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>As he comes in , MRS. FERGUSSON finally and entirely regains her usual manner .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Kissing her uncle .</stage>How d ’ you do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p><stage>Advancing gallantly to MRS. FERGUSSON .</stage>This is a pleasing surprise . I was under the impression you were in Paris .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>No , poor Mrs. Mack was suddenly taken much worse .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>It is my gain .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s too nice of you to say so , but I ’ m leaving London at once all the same .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>But this is very sudden . What shall we do without you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>You must blame Dr. O ’ Farrell .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Astonished .</stage>Me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>He tells me that now I ’ m quite strong enough for a foreign climate , and , of course , nothing will induce me to remain an hour away from my husband if I ’ m not obliged to .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>But I thought he was bravely fighting for his country .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Well , you see , there doesn ’ t happen to be any fighting for him to do just now , and he ’ s taken a very nice house at Malta . And I shall start to-morrow .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>This is more distressing than I can say . And are you going straight through ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>No , I shall stop a day or two in Paris on my way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>How very singular ! I had made all arrangements to go to Paris to-morrow myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>Then would you mind looking after me on the journey ? You see , I ’ m a womanly woman , and I ’ m quite helpless in the train by myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>I should look upon it as a privilege . And perhaps we might go to one or two plays while you ’ re there .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p>If you ’ ll promise not to take me to anything risky .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>Ha , ha , ha .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>To PENELOPE .</stage>Well , dear , I must say good-bye to you . I ’ m afraid we shan ’ t meet again for some time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Good-bye .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They kiss one another affectionately .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>To DICKIE .</stage>
      <l>Good-bye . If you hear of anything good on the Stock</l>
      <l>Exchange , you might let me know . I think I shall cut my loss on</l>
      <l>Johannesburg and New Jerusalems .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>

     <speaker>MRS. FERGUSSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>To BARLOW .</stage>I have a cab downstairs . Can I give you a lift anywhere ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>It would be very kind of you .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>With a nod to DICKIE she goes out .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p><stage>Shaking hands with PENELOPE .</stage>Charming creature . So dashing and a thorough gentlewoman .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Now , mind , Uncle Davenport , no pranks .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BARLOW</speaker>
     <p>My dear , I ’ m not only the soul of honour , but fifty-two .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Exit .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>As he goes out .</stage>I suppose that does induce a platonic state of mind .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a sigh of relief .</stage>Ouf !<stage>PENELOPE turns to a glass to arrange her hat . DICKIE watches her with a smile .</stage>Well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pretending to be surprised .</stage>I beg your pardon ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>You promised to kiss me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I didn ’ t . I promised to allow myself to be kissed .</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Finished ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Not nearly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Then I ’ m afraid you must go on another time . I ’ ve got a taxi at the door , and it ’ s costing twopence a minute .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Stepping back .</stage>What d ’ you want a taxi for ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taking both her hands .</stage>Now don ’ t tease me . Go and take those horrid motor things off , and let ’ s have a comfortable little tea together . And tell Peyton you ’ re not at home .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m dreadfully sorry to disappoint you , but I ’ m afraid I can ’ t break an engagement .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>You ’ re not serious ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s very nice of you to say so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Doesn ’ t it mean anything to you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Not much .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Beginning to be rather perplexed .</stage>But , Pen dear , pull yourself together . I love you just as much as you love me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a little smile .</stage>But what makes you think I love you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Aghast .</stage>You — you don ’ t mean to say that you don ’ t care for me any more ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Judicially .</stage>I — no longer feel that the world is coming to an end when you go out of the room .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>What !... Why don ’ t you say straight out that you can ’ t bear the sight of me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Because it wouldn ’ t be quite true . I like you very well .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Like me ! I don ’ t want you to like me . I want you to love me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I wish I could . It would save a lot of bother .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t understand . This is the most extraordinary thing I ’ ve ever heard in my life . I always thought you adored me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Because I adore you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Since when ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Always , always , always .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Fancy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I know I made a fool of myself . I shall never cease to regret it . D ’ you think I was happy ? D ’ you think I had a jolly time ? Not much .... I suppose it ’ s that . You can ’ t forgive me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Nonsense . Of course I forgive you . It doesn ’ t matter a bit .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a gesture of desperation .</stage>The whole thing ’ s Greek to me . I loved you always , Pen . I never ceased for a moment to love you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>My dear , you need not protest so much . It doesn ’ t very much interest me either way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>What a fool I was ! I ought to have known that if you took it so calmly it could only be because you didn ’ t care . If a woman doesn ’ t make scenes it can only mean that she doesn ’ t love you .... You used to love me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>How can you be so fickle ? I never thought you ’ d treat me like this .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PENELOPE looks about as if she ’ d lost something .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>What are you looking for ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I fancied you ’ d lost your sense of humour . I was just seeing if I could find it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>How can I have a sense of humour when I ’ m suffering ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Starting at the word .</stage>Suffering ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>The tortures of the damned . I want you . I want your love .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He does not see PENELOPE ’ S face . An expression of remorse comes into it at the pain she is causing him . She outlines a gesture towards him , but quickly restrains herself .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a mocking laugh .</stage>Poor darling .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Furiously .</stage>Don ’ t laugh at me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I wasn ’ t . I was quite sorry for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>D ’ you think I want your pity ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m very unfortunate . I seem quite unable to please you . I think it ’ s just as well that I ’ m going away for a week .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Starting up .</stage>No , you ’ re not going away .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Raising her eyebrows .</stage>What makes you think that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Because I forbid you to .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling .</stage>And are you under the delusion that at your command I shall fall flat on my face ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ m the master of this house , and I mean to make myself respected .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>My dear , since you pay the rent and the taxes it ’ s quite right that you should rule this house with a rod of iron if you wish it . Personally , at the moment I only want to get out of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>You ’ re not going out of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Do you propose to keep me here against my will ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Certainly , if needful .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>H ’ m .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She gets up and goes to the door . He intercepts her , locks the door , and puts the key in his pocket .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Brute force .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I think it ’ s about time I showed you I ’ m not going to be made a perfect fool of .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PENELOPE shrugs her shoulders and sits down . Suddenly she chuckles .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t see anything to laugh at .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I do . It ’ s so mediæval . And are you going to feed me on bread and water ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Angrily .</stage>Ugh .<stage>He looks at her .</stage>Now , look here , Pen , be reasonable about it . Why the deuce d ’ you want to go for this stupid trip ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>I refuse to discuss the matter till you ’ ve opened the door .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>It ’ s not the time of year for a motor trip .<stage>Pause . PENELOPE looks straight in front of her , taking no notice of what he says .</stage>It ’ ll rain cats and dogs , and you ’ ll catch a beastly cold . You ’ ll probably get pneumonia .<stage>Pause .</stage>I ’ m feeling awfully run down , and I shouldn ’ t wonder if I were sickening for something myself .<stage>PENELOPE smothers a giggle and continues to stare into vacancy . DICKIE breaks out passionately .</stage>But don ’ t you see that if I ’ m preventing you from going , it ’ s because I can ’ t bear to let you out of my sight ? I want you . I want you always by me . I want you to love me .... Oh , if you only knew how much I love you , you wouldn ’ t be so heartless .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Turning to him and speaking quite calmly .</stage>But surely , if you cared for me , you wouldn ’ t try to deprive me of a little enjoyment . You ’ d be willing to sacrifice yourself sometimes . You ’ d have a certain regard for my wishes . You wouldn ’ t put every absurd obstacle in the way when the chance offers for me to have some amusement .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>DICKIE looks at her for a moment then turns away and walks up and down , with downcast head . He takes the key out of his pocket and silently puts it on the table beside her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>What does that mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a broken voice .</stage>You ’ re quite right . I ’ ve simply been beastly selfish . I was only thinking of myself . I dare say I bore you . Perhaps you ’ ll like me better when you ’ ve been away for a few days .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PENELOPE is so moved that she can hardly keep up her acting any longer . She struggles with herself , and in a moment masters the desire to throw herself in his arms .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Since you locked the door , perhaps you ’ ll be good enough to unlock it .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Without a word he takes the key and goes to the door . He unlocks it .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Am I to understand that you offer no objection to my trip ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>If it ’ ll give you pleasure to go , I shall be pleased to think you ’ re happy . I only want you to be happy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Would you rather I stayed ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PENELOPE gives a slight start . This is not at all what she wants .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Oh !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t know what I shall do without you . I feel as if I were only now getting to know you . It ’ s as though — oh , I don ’ t know how to express it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>But you ’ ve just said you would rather I went .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I don ’ t want to think of myself any more . I want to think only of you . It makes me so happy to think of you , Pen . I want to sacrifice myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Relieved .</stage>Will you go to my room and see if my bag has been taken down ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He goes out for a moment . She remains with an ecstatic look on her face . He comes back .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes . Peyton ’ s taken it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Then —<stage>she gives him a look from beneath her eye-lashes</stage>— ring and tell her to bring it up again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hardly able to believe his good fortune .</stage>Pen !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Are you pleased ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Oh , you ’ re much too good to me . I can ’ t tell you how grateful I am . Oh ,</l>
      <l>Pen , if you only knew how much I adore you !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <stage>He falls on his knees and passionately kisses her hands . She can hardly restrain herself from lifting him up and flinging her arms round his neck .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Is there any chance for me at all ? D ’ you think you ’ ll ever love me as you used to ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>How can I tell ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , why can ’ t we go back to the beginning ? D ’ you remember how we loved one another then ? You used to come down with me every day when I went out , and when I came back you always ran down to kiss me . And d ’ you remember how you used to sit on my chair in the morning while I smoked my pipe and we read the paper together ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Concealing a smile .</stage>How you must have hated it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Hate it ? I ’ ve never been so happy in my life .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>At all events I hope we shall always continue to be good friends .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Starting up .</stage>Friends ! What ’ s the good of offering me your friendship when I ’ m starving for your love ? How can you make me so unhappy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Smiling indulgently .</stage>But I ’ m not going to make you unhappy . I hope I shall always be very pleasant and agreeable .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>What d ’ you think I care for that ? Pen , promise that you ’ ll try to love me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a smile .</stage>Yes , I ’ ll try if you like .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I ’ ll make you love me . I ’ ll never rest till I ’ m sure of your love .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>And when you are sure of it I suppose you won ’ t care twopence for me any more ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Try me ! Try me !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He kisses her hands again . He does not see her face . She smiles and shakes her head .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>I never knew that you were so adorable . It fills me with rapture merely to kiss your hands .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>PENELOPE gives a little laugh and releases herself .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Now I must just go to the Hendersons and tell them I can ’ t come motoring .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Can ’ t you telephone ? I don ’ t want to let you out of my sight .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>They ’ re not on the telephone . It ’ ll be more convenient for me to go .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Very well . If you must , I suppose you must .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She smiles and goes to the door . When she reaches it he stops her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Pen !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PENELOPE</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DICKIE</speaker>
     <p>At what time will you be back ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Recognising the phrase , she gives a gesture of amusement , quickly kisses her hand to him , and slips out of the door .</stage>
