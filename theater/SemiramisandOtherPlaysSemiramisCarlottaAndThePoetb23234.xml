      <stage>Exit Khosrove . She looks after him without moving until he passes out of sight . The moonlight is less bright . Her dove flies over her head . She starts and looks after it . The bird alights . She watches it eagerly and waits . It circles about her , then darts to her bosom . With an exultant moan she clasps it to her breast</stage>

Thou goest from love , And wilt look back and weep from every cloud ; I on thy track shall pause not till our wings Stir the same air and lock in kisses flying ! ... So pay my scorn ? How then hadst loved if heart Had brought to heart its swelling measure ? Then Our rosy hours had been the pick of time , And hung a flower ‘ mong withered centuries When every age had brought its reckoning in ! O , why will we , some cubits high , pluck at The sun and moon , when we have that within Makes us the soul and centre of Heaven itself ? Ambition , thou hast played away my crown And life . That I forgive thee , but not this — Thou ‘ st robbed me of the memory of his kiss . ... Go , world ! The conqueror 's trump that closed my ears Unto the angel in a lover 's voice Dies to a moan that fills but one lone heart . And soon ‘ tis silent . Ah , though woman build Her house of glory to the kissing skies , And the proud sun her golden rafters lay , And on her turrets pause discoursing gods , Let her not dare forget the stanchion truth — Immortal writ in every mortal face — “ Thou art the wife and mother of the world ! ”<stage>Sees Khosrove 's cloak upon the floor , and kneels by it , taking it in her hands</stage>My Khosrove !...

Spurns with her foot her own robe which has been left trampled</stage>Thou purple rag , lie there ! Love 's vesture shall Enfold me as I go !<stage>Starts out</stage>Alone ... on foot ... But I 've not far to journey . Foes are kind .... The first one met ... well , I will thank him !... Cries ? It is the feast . A man may feast who had — But has no son !...<stage>Startled</stage>‘ Tis not the feast !... I know That noise confused — hoarse shouts — shrieks — pawing steeds — And rumbling chariots ! Those are the tones Of battle ! O , the bloody work ! ‘ Tis war ! Did it delight me once ?... Assyrian cries ! My troops ! my troops ! They 've rallied ! How they cheer !

         <l>While shackling us by hand and foot to earth .</l>
         <l>But from these mountains will arise a queen ,</l>
         <l>The figure grey of ancient Liberty ,</l>
         <l>Mourning and wronged , but with the unpaling star</l>

        <speaker>Dup</speaker>
        <p>At last I am called to court ! I thought his majesty would soon or late have need of my experience in throat-cutting .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>Mir</speaker>
        <p>But , my dear Dupin , it is not in your capacity of throat-cutter that we introduce you . These towns that have given aid to the Liberals must be punished without the Emperor 's knowledge . You will make an example of them ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>

       <sp>
        <speaker>Baz</speaker>
        <p>I 'm not going to throw away the lives of any more Frenchmen just to give him a chance to play at clemency ! An emperor should be a sort of vitalized stone , capable of action but incapable of impression .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>Dup</speaker>
        <p>Then I 'm the man for emperor ! I 've always suspected my qualifications for the part . By the lord , I 've made women who were hungry enough to eat their own children watch my soldiers throw bread into the sea ! And when I was with the French and English in old Chinee — well , they 've called me the ‘ Tigre ’ since then . You 've heard about that !<stage>Struts and sings</stage>I 'm the tigre of the East , Got my claws in old Pekin When the yellow kids we fleeced And held up the mandarin ! O we caught him by the queue , As he from our captains flew , That quaking little , shaking little mandarin . And we dragged him out to view By that most convenient queue , When we sacked the summer palace at Pekin ! My friends , if you will excuse me , there are several dozens of ladies in the ball room waiting for a dance with the costume par excellence of the evening . I am not always sure of a welcome for my face , but my costume is never in doubt . Ah , sweet woman ! you can please me twice . I can dance with you — and I can kill you ! When the Emperor asks for me I shall not decline an introduction ,— though he was not born an emperor and I was born Dupin !<stage>Exit</stage></p>

We 're paid for our muscle , not our opinions .<stage>Shouts outside</stage>2d Guard . And the mob is paid for its lungs ! 1st Guard . Yes . Miramon sees to that . 2d Guard . Only the Emperor 's carriage approaches the door ? 1st Guard . None but his . 2d Guard . If I were he I would n't make such a glittering show of myself in that Milan carriage — all gold and silver and tortoise shell , and an angel at every corner — while there are so many hearts breaking in sound of it . 1st Guard . Ph ! He knows nothing of the breaking hearts ! Miramon sees to that . 2d Guard . He 'll have to know soon , or Juarez will tell him in the capital . 1st Guard . Not a word ! On your life !<stage>Shouts without</stage>Here they are ! By Jesu ! The fools have taken the mules from the carriage and draw it themselves ! Now I wonder how much a head Miramon pays for that !</p>

The Emperor stood just there . 2d Nun . Holy mother ! What did his Majesty do ? 1st Nun . He smiled , and said he might have chosen his place better ; then moved to the very spot where the ball had burst , as though he hoped another would follow it . 2d Nun . Blessed virgin ! Would he die ? 1st Nun . I 'm sure he would not live . Come , sister . Ah , we have but one loaf this morning . 2d Nun . Let us be glad we can give that ,— for many are hungry . 1st Nun . Many are starved — dead . 2d Nun . But the good Emperor ! It is so sad to think of him without food . 1st Nun . He will give this to his officers .

You are going to give up Roger — Roger who has worshipped you since you were a baby , who has lived under the same roof and been a brother to you since you were two years old — you are going to give him up for a strange man — a man without a penny — a man you have seen but once —<stage>Almost shrieking</stage>— but once —<stage>Rising</stage></p>

       <speaker>Mrs</speaker>
       <p>Del . I 'm going to . You can n't tell her father , because Helen must be persuaded , not opposed . And do n't speak about the money . If she loved a beggar she would trudge barefoot behind him .</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Hel</speaker>
       <p>A good warning , yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Mrs</speaker>
       <p>Del . I told you about meeting Mr. Poe last summer in Normandy . But — I did not tell you how often I met him .<stage>Helen rises , then Mrs. Delormis rises</stage>Helen , I prove my love for you by saying what it is so hard to utter to your pure self . My life has not been — all you would wish it to be — and Mr. Poe knows more about it than any other man .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Hel</speaker>
       <p>You lie ! I have seen his soul !</p>

       <speaker>Hel</speaker>
       <p><stage>Motionless with clenched hands</stage>Wicked , wicked woman !...<stage>Goes to window , rear , opens it , draws long breaths as if stifling , and turns back into room</stage>Edgar ! My love ! I was a thing of clay . One look from your eyes has made me a being of fire and air ....<stage>Lies down on couch and takes up her book</stage>I can not read ... or sleep ... or pray . There 's too much whirling in my heart for prayer ....<stage>Starts</stage>What moan is that ?...<stage>Rises , takes light from table , goes to window , leans out , casting the rays down</stage>Nothing .... I 'm fanciful .... The moon is rising .<stage>Goes back , putting light on table</stage>O , Edgar ! God help me to be what love must be to thee . Love that can look on miracles and be sane . What a face when he said goodnight ! Like an angel 's whose immortality is his wound .... Poor Roger !... What will my father say ?...<stage>Moonlight floods the window</stage>Welcome , soft nurse of dreams !<stage>Extinguishes lamp</stage>A little rest .... Ah , I know he does not sleep ....<stage>She lies on couch in the moonlight , her eyes closed . Poe enters by window , gazes at her , and throws up his arms in gesture of prayer</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Hel</speaker>
       <p><stage>Looking up , and springing to her feet</stage>Edgar ! My God , you must not come here !</p>

       <speaker>Hel</speaker>
       <p>O , I beg you —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p>I would but touch the hand that soothes my blood — look in the eyes that wrap my soul in balm — and you cry out as though some barbarous infidel had trampled you at prayers !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Hel</speaker>
       <p>My father — Roger — they will not understand .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p>O , you would bring the world in to say how and when we shall love ! Take note of the hour , and kiss by the clock ! Great love is like death , Helen . It knows no time of day . If a man were dying at your gates would you keep from him because ‘ twas midnight and not noon , and you were robed for sleep ? It was your soul I sought . Must you array that to receive me ? O , these women ! On Resurrection day they 'll not get up unless their clothes are called with them from the dust ! ‘ Excuse me , God , and send a dressmaker ! ’ Ha ! ha ! ha !<stage>Walks the floor in maniac humor</stage></p>

       <p>No wonder , when I have just come out of hell .... Keep your cool hand over my eyes .... O , this is peace !...<stage>Takes her hand from his forehead and holds it</stage>I made you a song out there , in the darkness . I was fainting for one gleam of light when you opened the window and stood as beautiful as Psyche leaning to the god of love . Listen ... and believe that my heart was as pure as the lines .<stage>Sings softly</stage>Helen , thy beauty is to me Like those Nicean barks of yore That gently o'er a perfumed sea The weary , wayworn wanderer bore To his own native shore . On desperate seas long wont to roam , Thy hyacinth hair , thy classic face , Thy Naiad airs , have brought me home To the glory that was Greece And the grandeur that was Rome . Lo , in yon brilliant window-niche How statue-like I see thee stand , An agate lamp within thy hand ,— Ah ! Psyche , from the regions which Are holy-land !</p>

       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p>O , what a night ! ‘ Tis like a poem flowing to the sea . Here I shake death from my garments . Oh , had my soul a tongue to trumpet thought , men from yon planets now would stare and lean to earth with listening ears !... Hark ! ‘ Tis music !</p>

       <p>Canst call it that ? I hear nothing that comes not from the stars . ‘ Tis Israfel ! The angel whose lute is his own heart ! If I could dwell Where Israfel Hath dwelt , and he where I , He might not sing so wildly well A mortal melody , While a bolder note than his might swell From my lyre within the sky ! Some day we shall live there , Helen , and then I will sing to thee !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Hel</speaker>
       <p>But now — my love — you must rest — you must sleep .</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p>I ! Nay , thy love has given me kinship with the deities ! Sleep ? Ay , when Nature naps , and God looks for a bed ! When yonder moon forgets her starry whirl and nodding falls from heaven ! When Ocean 's giant pulse is weary and grows still ! When Earth heaves up no seasons with their buds ! No , no , we will not sleep ! But see — there gleams the river — and yonder rise the hills touched new with Spring ! Wilt go there with me , Helen ? Now !</p>
      </sp>

       <speaker>Hel</speaker>
       <p>Now ?</p>

       <p>To-night ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p>Why not ? You say it as though night and day were not the same to the soul — except that night is more beautiful ! Why not go ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Hel</speaker>
       <p>I will tell you , love .<stage>Drawing him back to the large chair</stage>Come , listen .<stage>She sits in chair , and he kneels by her , the moonlight covering them</stage>Because I love you more than you love beauty , God or night , and you must live for me . And to live means — rest — sleep —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p>Do you love me so much ? O , ‘ tis like cool waters falling about me to hear you say it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Hel</speaker>
       <p>I will help you , Edgar . Already I feel my strength . Where I may serve you I 'll not meekly go , but go exultant . The thorns and stones so harsh to human feet , I 'll press as they were buds , and leave my blood for kisses .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p>Oh , go on .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Hel</speaker>
       <p>Yes , I 've more to tell you . It is — that you must help me , too . To-day — before you looked at me the first time — I was dying . Ah , more ,— I was about to set the seal of death on my soul . My mother , who died at sea when I was born , gave me a heritance with winds and waves and stars . But I was nursed by hands through whose clay ran no immortal streams . Cradled in convention , fed on sophistries , I wove a shroud about my soul , and within that hardening chrysalis it was dying away when you called it forth in time to live — dear God , in time to live ! Now you see how much you are to me , Edgar . I must not lose you . But you must be careful and patient with me , for my newly-bared soul shrinks from the wonders so familiar to you , and I may fly back to my chrysalis to escape the pain .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p>I am not afraid . Would a mother leave her babe ? And I am a child now , Helen . This strange , new rest you give me is like a gentle birth . I have been old all my life . Now the longing comes for a little of the childhood that was never mine . The years fall from me , and I have no wish but to lie on a mother 's bosom and hear her voice prattling above me .</p>

       <p>About the fairies — and a big giant — and a little girl lost in a wood —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p>And a little boy too ?</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>Hel</speaker>
       <p>Yes , a little boy , too ! And the little girl was crying —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p>And the little boy found her ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Hel</speaker>
       <p>Yes , and he told her not to cry , that he could kill the big giant , and he hid the little girl in a cave —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p>Was it a dark cave , mama ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Hel</speaker>
       <p>No-o-o ! It was a cave — with — windows in it ! And by and by he heard the giant coming —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p>Oh !<stage>Hides his face on her breast . She holds him to her , her hands on his hair</stage>And when the little boy heard the leaves rustling closer and closer he climbed a great tree —</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>Hel</speaker>
       <p>O , no-o !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p>Because that little boy was me !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Hel</speaker>
       <p>Yes . And when you got to the top of the tree —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p>O , what did I do then ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Hel</speaker>
       <p>Why , you see this was the biggest giant that e-v-e-r lived — and his head was just as high as the top of the tree — so when he came by —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p>I know ! I know ! I just out with my sword , and off went his head !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Hel</speaker>
       <p>So it did ! And then you climbed down from the tree —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p>And the little girl came out of the cave —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Hel</speaker>
       <p>And you went off together happy ever after !</p>

       <speaker>Hel</speaker>
       <p>What , darling ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p>That I wish you were n't my mama , so you could be that little girl !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Hel</speaker>
       <p>O , I can , dear . For there were the fairies . We forgot the fairies . They gave me this pretty ring , so that when I put it on I can be whoever I please , and I please to be just whoever my little boy likes best .</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Hel</speaker>
       <p>But do not try to write out all your soul , Edgar . That cannot be . Poetry is but one gate . The soul goes out by a thousand ways .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p>True . And we will find those ways together , Helen . We will gather truth in every path ,— truth that flowers out of the struggle and carnage of life like the bloom of song on the crimson of war .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Hel</speaker>
       <p>But we may not know all . Man 's greatest knowledge is but the alphabet of the eternal book . We must be content with the letters , and not unhappily strive to read .</p>

       <p><stage>Wildly</stage>O , you will leave me , Helen ! You can not stay ! For I will play the madman to thy sense when I am sanest , and like a shivering Atlas shake thy world when most thou wouldst be still . This body wraps more lives then one , my girl . When I was born no pitying angel dipped my spirit-fire in Lethe . I weep with all the dead as they my brothers were , and haunt the track of time to shudder with his ghosts . Wilt fare with me , brave Helen ? Wilt tread the nadir gloom and golden paths of suns ? Canst gaze with me into the fearful , grey infinitude —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Hel</speaker>
       <p>That grey infinitude is yet the circle of your being . The mind can not leave itself . You are always in your own country . Why should you fear ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p>The mind that can not leave itself knows nothing . Not the ‘ I am ’ but ‘ Thou art ’ is God . O , there is a realm of which imagination is but a shadow — where the mind is burnt away in His vision 's fire , and thought becomes celestial angel of itself ! And you turn back with the first step — already I am alone —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Hel</speaker>
       <p>No ! I , too , have hung upon the boundaries of the world to catch God 's flying dreams ! O , trust me ! Thou shalt fling no lance but I will cast it on to gleam in a farther sun ! Bring me roses from Jupiter , I 'll bring thee lilies from Uranus ! O ,—</p>

       <p>Del . Well , you were out of your senses to come here and think Helen would understand it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p>I was not ! She did understand ! The vision that led me to her feet was as clear as an archangel 's ! It is now that I am mad , and see everything gross and darkened with earth and flesh !<stage>Overcome , sinks on couch . She hastily brings wine</stage></p>

       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p><stage>Brightening</stage>No . You were right . ‘ Twas what I needed . ‘ T will keep life in me till she comes . Go to her now . Tell her I will leave her — I will go away for a year — a thousand years — if she will only say I may come back some day . I will live in a desert and pray myself to the bone !

      <stage>Virginia comes out at the front door of cottage , and walks across the lawn to the shade of a bay tree where Poe lies in a hammock as if asleep . A book on the ground . She goes up softly and sits on a garden chair near him . He opens his eyes</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Vir</speaker>
       <p>O , I have waked you !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p>No , little houri . I was not asleep . I would not give one breath of this sweet world to cold , unconscious sleep .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Vir</speaker>
       <p>You are happy , cousin Edgar ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p>No , Virginia . This is all too delicious to be called happiness . Too calm , like the stilling of a condor 's wings above sea-guarding peaks . He flies when he is happy . When more than happy , it is enough to pause in the blue and breathe wonders .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Vir</speaker>
       <p>Is it wonderful here , Edgar ? It has always seemed so to me , but I have been afraid to tell anyone . It seems like a great fairy house with God in it . Is it wonderful , cousin ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p>You are wonderful .</p>

       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p><stage>Rising</stage>Why , my little aspiring Venus , let me tell you something . I have wandered somewhat in life — at home and over sea — and I have never looked upon a woman fairer than yourself .</p>

       <speaker>Vir</speaker>
       <p><stage>Springing up in delight</stage>O , I am so happy ! You would not flatter me ! You are the soul of truth !</p>

       <p>Why , cousin ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p>I shall have the water about my ears presently . I thought I was drowning on a mermaid 's bosom . Read no more , Virginia . One nibble at a time is enough of Spenser . He ought to be made into a thousand little poems . Then we should have a multitude of gems instead of a great granite mountain that nobody can circuit without weariness .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Vir</speaker>
       <p>You know so much , Edgar . Will you teach me while you are here , if I try very hard to learn ?</p>

      <stage>Mrs. Clemm comes out of cottage and crosses to them . She gently takes Poe 's hand from his face and kisses him</stage>

       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p><stage>Seizing her hand and holding it</stage>Do n't — do n't be so kind to me , aunt ! It tells too much of what has never been mine .

       <speaker>Mrs</speaker>
       <p>C .<stage>Taking his head on her breast</stage>My dear Edgar ! You will be my son — Virginia 's brother !</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p><stage>Lifting his face smiling</stage>I will be happy ! No more of that solitude lighted only by the eyes of ghouls ! Here I have come into the light . I have found the sun . I see what my work should be — what Art is . She is beauty and joy . Her light should fall on life like morning on the hills . The clouds of passion and agony should never darken her face . O , I can paint her now ready for the embrace of the soul !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Mrs</speaker>
       <p>C. I can not see things with your rapturous eyes , Edgar , but I know that your work will be noble , and I love you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p>O , aunt , you and this little wonder-witch have enchanted me back to happiness . I promise you never again shall you see a tear on my face or a frown on my brow .<stage>Virginia , looking toward the road , bows as to some one passing</stage></p>

       <speaker>Mrs</speaker>
       <p>C. You know him , Edgar ? He is staying with my brother-in-law , Nelson Clemm , for a short time , and has asked to call on us — on Virginia , I mean , for of course I do n't count , now that my little girl is suddenly turned woman .</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p>Like him ! We were at West Point together . He refused to accept a challenge after slandering me vilely , and I was obliged to thrash him . That 's all .<stage>Turns suddenly to Virginia</stage>And you were blushing for him !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Vir</speaker>
       <p>It was not because I like him , Edgar .</p>

       <p>Yes . The trade and barter part of it . I shall be in the holy temple while he keeps a changer 's table on the steps .<stage>Shrugging</stage>Brackett ! Pah !...

Suits me exactly — suits me exactly . So get your hat and come along . I drove across the ridge and left my trap at Judge Carroll 's .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Mrs</speaker>
       <p>C. Her clothes , Nelson ! There 's nothing ready —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Mr</speaker>
       <p>C. You mean to say ! When we 've been talkin ’ this thing a whole year ? And you a thrifty woman tell me her clothes ai n't ready ? Well , she 'll come without ‘ em , that 's all . You can send ‘ em along afterwards . I 've got it all fixed up , I tell you . My brother 's child shall have her chance — she shall have her chance , so long as I 've got a dollar in my pocket and she walks exactly to please me — walks exactly to please me . It 's for you to say , Maria , whether you 'll stand in the way o ’ your own flesh and blood or not .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Mrs</speaker>
       <p>C. Of course , Nelson , I am very grateful , and do not dream of depriving Virginia of this opportunity , only —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Mr</speaker>
       <p>C. That 's all there is to it then . No onlys about it . Go get your hat , girl .<stage>Virginia goes slowly into the house . At the door she meets Zurie who turns back and goes in with her</stage></p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>Mrs</speaker>
       <p>C. Now , Nelson ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Mr</speaker>
       <p>C. It 's just this . My brother 's child sha n't stay another hour in the same house with Edgar Poe . That 's the plain tale of it , Maria .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Mrs</speaker>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Mrs</speaker>
       <p>C. Lies ! All lies ! Every one of them ! He is the soul of honor ! Already Virginia loves him like a brother ! I trust her instinct ! I trust my own !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Mr</speaker>
       <p>C. O , I 'm not arguin ’ , I 'm just doin ’ . You can n't turn him out , of course . Would n't do it myself . Nobody 'll ever say Nelse Clemm was an inhospitable dog ! But I can look out for Virginia , and I will . She goes with me now , or I 'm done with you and yours — and you know that mortgage ai n't paid off yet .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Mrs</speaker>
       <p>C. Yes , she shall go . She ought to be in school and again I thank you for helping us . But you are wronging my nephew ,— one of the noblest of men . You do n't know him !</p>
      </sp>

       <p>C. My dear Edgar , we must not let our affections root so deep in mortal things .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p>Mortal ? Virginia mortal ! She is a sister to Psyche , immortal as the breath that blew her into beauteous bloom !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>

       <p>No . Sane at last . I have been mad until now . I have drunk loneliness and death . Here I breathe , grateful , glad as a flower ! My breast swells and falls as a bird 's throat with happy song ! O , aunt , help me to accept this fair new life — the only real life ! Do not drive me back to gloom and the devils ! Give me your Virginia !</p>

       <speaker>Poe</speaker>
       <p>I will teach her — teach her more than she will ever learn at the great mess table of knowledge where the genius must take his treacle and the blacksmith his ambrosia ! O , aunt , you will give her to me ?</p>

Help me draw up this sofa , Ethel .<stage>They pull sofa to the fire . Annie settles herself comfortably</stage>I feel just like giving you a lecture , Virginia . You must make Edgar go out more . Anybody will get queer shut up here . The other day when mamma asked him to come to our party he was n't more than half polite when he refused , and we were going to have Mr. Melrose Libbie to meet him too . Said his work would keep him at home ! Now you know , Virginia , that poetry is n't work . It 's just dash off a line now and then , and there you are ! Mr. Libbie said so . O , he had the sweetest thing on the woman 's page in last Sunday 's paper ! Did you see it ? You 'd better call Edgar 's attention to it . Mamma read it to all of us at the breakfast table , and —</p>

        <p>Virginia , Virginia ! I pour out my soul to you ! I keep back no drop of its sea ! From the infinite , shrouded sources of life I rush to you in a thousand singing rivers , only to waste , to burn , to die on the sands of silence !<stage>She remains motionless , her head bowed</stage>It is so still upon the eternal peaks . Will you not come up with me and be the bride of my dreams ? You need not speak ... you need not say a word . Only put the light of poesy in your eyes and let me see that through the channel of their beauty course the mysteries that begin with God and end not with time !<stage>She looks at him . He gazes into her eyes</stage>Tears ... only tears .<stage>Turns away</stage>Can a soul 's eyes be dumb ?<stage>She sits , weeping silently</stage>Come then ... talk of what you will . Only talk ! You have read a little Byron to-day ? The new magazine came ? And you have made me a handkerchief ?<stage>She sobs . He looks at her remorsefully , crosses the room , gets her harp and brings it to the fireside</stage>Come ... sing to me , Virginia . You can do that .</p>

Spring from perfection 's heart shall pluck her buds , and set such gloss on Nature she may laud her old self in one violet 's requiem ! O , I 'll sing the world into a flower for thy bosom ! My love , my love , my love !<stage>She coughs restrainedly . He hides his face till she stops</stage>Even the senseless oak velvets its rude sides to the tender vine !

        <p>My dear Mrs. Bridgmore ! The pleasure of years gathers in this happy moment . Are you making holiday purchases ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>Hel</speaker>
        <p>No ... just poking about . I love these old stores . I see you 've made a sale . ‘ Tis a relief to get rid of old books when we 've lost our love for them , is n't it ? They take up good room on our shelves pretty much as people do in our lives long after we have ceased to care for their friendship . But what one is weary of another is ready to take up .<stage>To bookseller</stage>May I see the book the gentleman has just disposed of ?<stage>To Poe</stage>Anything you have liked will be sure to please me .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>Poe</speaker>
        <p>O , you are mistaken ! I am simply leaving the book to be duplicated if possible for a friend of mine who has taken a fancy to my copy .<stage>Gesticulates to bookseller</stage>One glance , Mrs. Bridgmore , will tell you that the book is not for sale .</p>
       </sp>

        <speaker>Hel</speaker>
        <p>Ah ... of course not . Pardon the mistake . It seems to be my fate to blunder where you are concerned .<stage>Icily</stage>Good morning , Mr. Poe .</p>

       <stage>As she is going out she drops her purse . Poe hastens to pick it up and restores it to her with a bow . In doing so he forgets his shabby coat and throws back his cloak over his arm , exposing a badly worn sleeve .

        <p>Yes , dear . I was so young ... I thought I could help you ... and so I let you marry me . I did not know . I thought because I loved you so much that I could make you happy .

When the truth came I looked every way and there was no help . Then when I found I was to die , it seemed that God had pitied and helped me . For that was the only way .... O , these little women who can do nothing but love ! I wish I could take them all with me . These tears are for them , not for myself , darling . O , I am happy , but they must wait ... they can not die . How you shiver ! You must take your cloak . I am warm now . Indeed , I am quite comfortable .... Do n't — do n't weep .

        <p>I regret that I belong to that feeble and limited variety of creation , but with the next self-diffusion of the concentrated Infinite I may be the Sun himself !</p>

        <speaker>Poe</speaker>
        <p>Think a little more and you will forget it . The heart makes the being there on the bed your daughter — my wife — but the mind makes her a part of the divine force which has chosen her shape for its visible flower . The heart is wrung by the falling of the bloom , for it is endeared to that only , but the mind rejoices in its reunited divinity . Come ....<stage>Moves a step toward the bed</stage>I can look on her now ... and be quiet . Sweet rose , I can watch your petals fall . But they fall early ... they fall early ... blasted in the May . Not by the divine breath drawing you home , but by my mortal , shattering hand ! I promised you sun and dew .... I have given you frost and shadows . O God ! O God ! let me not think ! Keep me a little , weeping child !</p>

        <speaker>Poe</speaker>
        <p>No ! I touched her like a wing of doom , and she fell blasted !<stage>She tries to soothe him</stage>No , no ! Call devils from hell to curse me !</p>

O , might such rest be mine !<stage>Turns away</stage>I 'll write .<stage>Goes to table</stage>I promised . Yes ... I 'll write . Behind the glorious chancel of the mind still swings the incense to the deathless gods !...<stage>Sits and writes</stage>No .<stage>Rising</stage>No rhymes — for Poesy must mourn to-night .<stage>Goes toward bed</stage>Too much of her is dead .<stage>Gazes at Virginia</stage>Cold ... cold . What art thou death ? Ye demons of a mind distraught , keep ye apace till I have fathomed this !... Ha ! What scene is that ?<stage>Stares as at visions</stage>A valley laid in the foundations of darkness ! The unscalable cliffs jut to heaven , and on the amethystine peaks sit angels weeping into the abyss where creatures run to and fro without escape ! Some eat , some laugh , some weep , some wonder . Now they make themselves candles whose little beams eclipse the warning stars ... and in the pallid light they dance and think it sun ! But on the revel creeps a serpent , fanned and crimson , with multitudinous folds lapping the dancing creatures in one heaving carnage ! The candles die .... The stars cannot pierce the writhing darkness .... Above on the immortal headlands sit the angels , looking down no more , for the dismal heap no longer throbs .... I must write this ! Now ! While I see it ! That moaning flood ebbing to silence ... those rosy promontories lit with angel wings ... and over all as large and still as heaven , the cold , unweeping eyes of God !...<stage>Writes .... A tapping at the door . He does not hear . Another tapping . He looks up</stage>Who 's there ?... This is my vigil . Nor devil nor angel shall share it !...<stage>Listens . Tapping . He goes to door and throws it open</stage>Nothing ... nothing ... but darkness .<stage>Stands peering , and whispers</stage>Lenore !...<stage>Closes door , bolts it , returns to table and writes silently . Utter stillness , then a rattling at the window . Poe leaps up</stage>What 's that ?<stage>The shutter is blown open . Poe stands watching .

After a moment rises and reads</stage>Out — out are the lights — out all ! And over each quivering form , The curtain , a funeral pall , Comes down with the rush of a storm — And the angels all pallid and wan , Uprising , unveiling affirm That the play is the tragedy ‘ Man ! ’ And its hero the Conqueror Worm ! Ah ! the thought pales from these lines like light from dying cinders . Poetry is but ashes telling that a fire has passed .<stage>Sits gloomily . Suddenly remembers the raven , turns and stares at it</stage>You bird of damnation , leave me in peace with my dead !... O , dreaming fool , ‘ tis nothing .... My mind 's a chaos that surges up this fancy .<stage>Tries to write , stops , goes on , trembles , and looks up</stage>Can I know fear ? I , the very nursling of dreams ? Who have lived in a world more tenanted with ghosts than men ? I can not be afraid ....<stage>Tries to write . Drops pen . Shudders , looking with furtive fear at the raven</stage>I am ... I am afraid .... Virginia !<stage>Creeps toward bed</stage>Stay with me , little bride . My little rose-bride !<stage>Fingers along coverlet , looking at raven</stage>Do not leave me . Quick , little love ! Give me life in a kiss !<stage>Touches her hand , shrinks , and springs up</stage>Dead !...<stage>Leans against foot of bed , wildly facing the raven</stage>Speak , fiend ! From what dim region of unbodied souls hast come ? What hell ungorged thee for her messenger ? What sentence have the devils passed upon me ? To what foul residence in some blasted star am I condemned ? Speak ! By every sigh that poisons happy breath !— by every misery that in me rocks and genders her swart young !— by yonder life that now in golden ruin lies !— I charge thee speak ! How long shall I wander without rest ? How long whirl in the breath of unforgiving winds ? Or burn in the refining forges of the sun ? When will the Universe gather me to her heart and give me of her still , unthrobbing peace ? Speak ! When — O when will this driven spirit be at home ?</p>

I do n't mind sayin ’ it , Mr. Poe , a nice lookin ’ man always did take my eye , an ’ you 'll be a pretty figure when you 're plumped out a bit , indeed you will , but your addresses of this offer is somewhat unusual , an ’ if you 'll give me time —</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>Poe</speaker>
        <p>The weather , madam , will admit of no delay . Since you are so determined , I must give up hope and seek shelter under Jove 's great canopy .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>Mrs</speaker>
        <p>S. O , do n't go there , Mr. Poe — it 's a bad place , that Canpy house , an ’ I 've heard Jove talked about for a vile barkeep ! I guess since you 're so impetus I 'll say yes to these addresses of marriage , Mr. Poe .</p>

        <p>I know this place . It is the poet 's house of dream that all my life I 've sought to reach . I am dying now , and they let me in , because I have been true to them . The master will read it in my face . I have not eaten of the flesh-pots ! I have beggared my body , but I have not beggared my soul !</p>

        <p>Yonder is the master , arrayed all in white and gold and sapphire . Those angels that attend him are poets wrapped in fires of love . They talk about me now , and ask if I am worthy to come in . O , I have loved ye well , immortal dead ! Through noons that burnt the world I 've tracked your dewy shadows ! No day died in my eyes but ye were whispering priests ! And midnight stars have learned your names of me !</p>
