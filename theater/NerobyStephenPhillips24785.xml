     <stage>SCENE .— The scene is in the Great Hall in the Palace of the Caesars . At the back are steps leading to a platform with balustrade opening on the air , and beyond , a view of the city .</stage>
    </stage>
    <stage>On the right of the stage is a cedarn couch on which CLAUDIUS is uneasily sleeping . On the right is a door communicating with the inner apartments . On the left a door communicating with the outer halls .</stage>
    <stage>XENOPHON is standing by the couch of CLAUDIUS . AGRIPPINA is sitting with face turned to an ASTROLOGER , who stands at the top of the steps watching the stars .</stage>
    <stage>LOCUSTA is crouching beside a pillar , right . A meteor strikes across the sky . The ASTROLOGER , pointing upwards , comes down the steps slowly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ASTROLOGER</speaker>
     <p>These meteors flame the dazzling doom of kings .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>AGRIPPINA rises apprehensively .</stage>

     <speaker>XENOPHON</speaker>
     <p>Caesar is dead !</p>

<stage>To LOCUSTA , who steals forward . Locusta , take your price and steal away ! Sound on the trumpet . Go ! your part is done .</stage>      <l>The drug hath found his heart .</l>
<stage>Exit LOCUSTA . [ Trumpet is sounded .</stage>      <l>That gives the sign to the Praetorians</l>
      <l>Upon the instant of the Emperor 's death .</l>
<stage>Answering trumpets are heard .</stage>      <l>Hark ! trumpets answering through all the city .</l>
      <l>Xenophon , you and I are in this death</l>
      <l>Eternally bound . This husband have I slain</l>
      <l>To lift unto the windy chair of the world</l>
      <l>Nero , my son . Your silence I will buy</l>
      <l>With endless riches ; but a hint divulged ——</l>

     <speaker>AGRIPPINA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Meantime his child , his heir , Britannicus ,</l>
      <l>Must not be seen lest he be clamoured for .</l>
      <l>So till the sad Chaldean give the sign</l>
      <l>Of that so yearned for , favourable hour ,</l>
      <l>When with good omens may my son succeed ,</l>
      <l>The sudden death of Claudius must be hid !</l>
      <l>Then on the instant Nero be proclaimed</l>
      <l>And Rome awake on an accomplished deed .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>XENOPHON</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Then summon Claudius ’ musicians in</l>
      <l>To play unto the dead as though he breathed .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AGRIPPINA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Call them ! A lulling music let them bring .</l>
<stage>Exit XENOPHON . [ She turns to ASTROLOGER .</stage>      <l>O thou who readest all the scroll of the sky ,</l>
      <l>Stands it so sure Nero my son shall reign ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ASTROLOGER</speaker>
     <p>Nero shall reign .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AGRIPPINA</speaker>
     <p>What lurks behind these words ? There is a ‘ but ’ still hovering in the stars .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ASTROLOGER</speaker>
     <p>Nero shall reign .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AGRIPPINA</speaker>
     <p>The half ! I 'll know the rest .</p>

     <p>Peer not for peril !</p>

     <p>Peril ! His or mine ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ASTROLOGER</speaker>
     <p>Thine then .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AGRIPPINA</speaker>
     <p>I will know all , however dark . Finish what did so splendidly begin .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ASTROLOGER</speaker>
     <p>Nero shall reign , but he shall kill his mother .</p>

     <p>Kill me , but reign !</p>

    <stage>Enter SENECA</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SENECA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>The trumpet summoned me ,</l>
      <l>And I am here .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AGRIPPINA</speaker>
     <p>Seneca ! Speak it low ! Caesar is dead ! Nero shall climb the throne .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SENECA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I will not ask the manner of his death .</l>
      <l>In studious ease I have protested much</l>
      <l>Against the violent taking of a life .</l>
      <l>But lost in action I perceive at last</l>
      <l>That they who stand so high can falter not ,</l>
      <l>But live beyond the reaches of our blame ;</l>
      <l>That public good excuses private guile .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AGRIPPINA</speaker>
     <p>You , Xenophon and Burrus , stand with me .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Enter BURRUS , right . He salutes the corse of CLAUDIUS</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BURRUS</speaker>
     <p>Obedient to the trumpet-call I come .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AGRIPPINA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Say , Burrus , quickly say , how stands our cause</l>
      <l>With the Praetorians who unmake and make Emperors ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BURRUS</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>The Praetorians are staunch ,</l>
      <l>And they are marching now upon the Palace .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AGRIPPINA</speaker>
     <p>Will they have Nero ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BURRUS</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Yes , and double pay .</l>
      <l>There is a murmuring minority</l>
      <l>Who toss about the name Britannicus .</l>
      <l>These may be feared ; let Nero scatter gold</l>
      <l>There where dissension rises — it will cease .</l>
      <l>Their signal when they shall surround the Palace ,</l>
      <l>The gleam of my unsheathed sword to the dawn .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AGRIPPINA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Stand there until I have from him the sign ,</l>
      <l>Then let thy sword gleam upward to the dawn .</l>
      <stage>Turning and pointing to body of CLAUDIUS . That is my work ! Also , I must betroth Nero unto the young Octavia , And with the dead man 's daughter mate my son . This marriage sets him firmer on the throne , And foils the party of Britannicus . [ To BURRUS .</stage>
      <l>You for the army answerable stand .</l>
      <stage>To SENECA .</stage>
      <l>And , Seneca , I have entrusted Nero 's mind</l>
      <l>To you , to point an eaglet to the sun .</l>
      <l>Nero ? What does he ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SENECA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Nero knows not yet</l>
      <l>That Claudius is dead . Rome hath not slept ,</l>
      <l>But to the torch-lit circus all have run</l>
      <l>To see him victor in a chariot race ,</l>
      <l>Whence he is now returning . A night race</l>
      <l>By burning torches is his newest whim .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AGRIPPINA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>A torch-lit race ! And yet why not ? My child</l>
      <l>Should climb all virgin to the throne of the earth ,</l>
      <l>Not conscious of spilt blood : and I meantime</l>
      <l>Will sway the deep heart of the mighty world .</l>
      <l>The peril is Britannicus : for Nero ,</l>
      <l>Careless of empire , strings but verse to verse .</l>
      <l>How shall this dove attain the eagle cry ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SENECA</speaker>
     <p>Be not so sure of Nero 's harmlessness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AGRIPPINA</speaker>
     <p>What do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SENECA</speaker>
     <lg>
<stage>Steps heard without . The dead man 's children startled from their sleep ! Britannicus , Octavia , wondering .</stage>      <l>By me he has been taught ,</l>
      <l>And I have watched him . True , the harp , the song ,</l>
      <l>The theatre , delight this dreamer : true ,</l>
      <l>He lives but in imaginations : yet</l>
      <l>Suppose this aesthete made omnipotent ,</l>
      <l>Feeling there is no bar he cannot break ,</l>
      <l>Knowing there is no bound he cannot pass ;</l>
      <l>Might he not then despise the written page ,</l>
      <l>A petty music , and a puny scene ?</l>
      <l>Conceive a spectacle not witnessed yet ,</l>
      <l>When he , an artist in omnipotence ,</l>
      <l>Uses for colour this red blood of ours ,</l>
      <l>Composes music out of dreadful cries ,</l>
      <l>His orchestra our human agonies ,</l>
      <l>His rhythms lamentations of the ruined ,</l>
      <l>His poet 's fire not circumscribed by words ,</l>
      <l>But now translated into burning cities ,</l>
      <l>His scenes the lives of men , their deaths a drama ,</l>
      <l>His dream the desolation of mankind ,</l>
      <l>And all this pulsing world his theatre .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AGRIPPINA</speaker>
     <p>Till the auspicious hour he is not dead . OCTAVIA and BRITANNICUS enter</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OCTAVIA</speaker>
     <p>We could not sleep : father is very sick . We fancied every moment that he called us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BRITANNICUS</speaker>
     <p>And then these meteors full of coming woe ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OCTAVIA</speaker>
     <p>So brilliant and so silent ! O , I fear them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BRITANNICUS</speaker>
     <p>Is father yet awake ? We want to ask him ——</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>THEY approach the couch . AGRIPPINA interposes .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AGRIPPINA</speaker>
     <p>Do not disturb your father for this night .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OCTAVIA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>We will not speak , nor make the smallest sound</l>
      <l>To wake him . We must kiss him ere we sleep .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AGRIPPINA</speaker>
     <p>Children , he is in need of some long rest . Go back to bed : your father sleepeth sound .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BRITANNICUS</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I will go in to him , I will — and you</l>
      <l>Are not our mother . By what privilege</l>
      <l>Do you thus interpose yourself between</l>
      <l>A father and his children ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AGRIPPINA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Would you then</l>
      <l>Trouble him , when to sleep is all he asks ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OCTAVIA</speaker>
     <p>Only a moment ! But to see him !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AGRIPPINA</speaker>
     <lg>
<stage>OCTAVIA holds her face to be kissed . To-night I think I will not kiss you , child . Good-night , good-night .</stage>      <l>No !</l>
      <l>Come softly back to bed ! no — no — this way !</l>
      <l>Britannicus , with the first peer of light</l>
      <l>You shall behold your father ; but not now .</l>
      <l>So the physician , Xenophon , enjoined me .</l>
      <l>Now take Octavia 's hand — so , both of you .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <stage>Exit OCTAVIA and BRITANNICUS .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SENECA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>How often have I taught</l>
      <l>And written , ‘ Children shall not be beguiled</l>
      <l>Even for good ends . ’ And yet , the single lie</l>
      <l>Must , for the general good , be spoken ; yet ——</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <stage>MUSICIANS meanwhile have entered , and are playing dreamy music . AGRIPPINA turns to ASTROLOGER , holding out her arms .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AGRIPPINA</speaker>
     <p>How long till Rome shall greet her Emperor ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ASTROLOGER</speaker>
     <p>Behold the heavens ! The moment !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Exit ASTROLOGER .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AGRIPPINA</speaker>
     <p>Give the sign !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Sounds of acclamation and cries of ‘ Nero . ’ BURRUS draws his sword .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BURRUS</speaker>
     <p>See the Praetorians !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SENECA</speaker>
     <p>Nero returns .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Enter a HERALD gorgeously dressed , bearing a silver wreath</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MESSENGER</speaker>
     <p>From Nero unto Agrippina greeting ! He comes a victor from the chariot race .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Sounds of acclamation grow louder , the crowd of NERO 'S friends and satellites pours in : last comes NERO dressed as a charioteer .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>AGRIPPINA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Touching CLAUDIUS ’ body .</stage>
<stage>NERO pauses wondering . Claudius is dead . Reign thou . Ave Caesar !</stage>      <l>That music be a dirge : Caesar is dead .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <stage>BURRUS leads NERO to back of platform , and addresses the soldiers at back .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BURRUS</speaker>
     <p>Caesar is dead ! Behold Caesar !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>A great shout of ‘ NERO ! ’ ‘ CAESAR ! ’ Meanwhile AGRIPPINA and SENECA are listening close together . Discordant cries are heard of ‘ BRITANNICUS ! ’ A slave or attendant on NERO scatters gold in the direction of these discordant cries , which gradually subside , and are lost in one long shout of ‘ Nero , Imperator . ’ NERO motions for silence .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NERO</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Turning to Court .</stage>
      <l>Behold this forest of uprisen spears ,</l>
      <l>Symbol of might ! But I upon that might</l>
      <l>Would not rely . You hail me Emperor —</l>
      <l>Then hail me as an Emperor of peace .</l>
      <l>First , I declare divinest clemency .</l>
      <l>No deaths have I to avenge , no wrath to bribe ,</l>
      <l>No desperate followers clamouring for spoil ;</l>
      <l>Pardon from me may beautifully fall .</l>
      <l>Next , I bestow full liberty of speech ;</l>

     <p>O , all the earth to-night into these hands Committed ! I bow down beneath the load , Empurpled in a lone omnipotence . My softest whisper thunders in the sky , And in my frown the temples sway and reel , And the utmost isles are anguished . I but raise An eyelid , and a continent shall cower ; My finger makes the city a solitude , The murmuring metropolis a silence , And kingdoms pine in my dispeopling nod . I can dispearl the sea , a province wear Upon my little finger ; all the winds Are busy blowing odours in mine eyes , And I am wrapt in glory by the sun , And I am lit by splendours of the moon , And diadem 'd by glittering midnight . O wine of the world , the odour and gold of it ! There is no thirst which I may not assuage ; There is no hunger which I may not sate ; Nought is forbidden me under heaven !<stage>With a cry .</stage>I shall go mad ! I shall go mad !<stage>ACTE steals in noiselessly , and waits till he turns , then comes down to him .</stage>My Acte !</p>

      <l>Lonely at last ; your friends all fallen away</l>
      <l>From you ; the laurel upon other brows</l>

     <p>O Caesar , the Augusta had not left The palace ; and now , o'erjoyous at thy words , She will be present at the supper-board , Bringing with her the prince Britannicus .<stage>Servants enter with various dishes and arrange the tables and couches for the guests , and supper begins .</stage><stage>They all recline amid a low hum of conversation . Dreamy music is heard , which might be a continuation of the music played before .</stage>NERO reclines at the head of the central table between AGRIPPINA and OCTAVIA . POPPAEA is a prominent figure . BRITANNICUS , with other youths , lies at a side table . SENECA , BURRUS , and TIGELLINUS present with other members of the Court . At a sign from NERO dancing girls enter and perform a strange , wild measure , after which the hum of conversation is resumed . Again , at a sign from NERO , odours are spurted over the guests amid cries of delight .</p>

    <stage>At a sign from NERO , flowers descend from the ceiling . At first lilies , then of deeper and deeper colour . At last a tempest of roses which gradually slackens .</stage>

      <l>Britannicus , I voice a general wish .</l>
      <l>Sweet is it , early and thus easily</l>
      <l>To have garnered fame : the crown is for the few ,</l>
      <l>And these are tasked to reach it ere they die .</l>
      <l>Oftener the laurel on grey hairs is laid ,</l>
      <l>Or on the combed tresses of the dead .</l>

     <speaker>BRITANNICUS</speaker>
     <lg>
<stage>Cold snow is put in and he drinks . He then recites . Beside the melancholy surge I roam — A sad exile , a stranger , sick for home : A prince I was in my far native land Who wander to and fro this alien sand : Riches I had , and steeds , a glimmering crown ; Never had known a harshness or a frown . Now must I limp and beg from door to door , Wet with the storm , or in the sun footsore : I , by a brother 's cunning dispossessed , Crave for these languid limbs a place of rest . Pity me , robbed of all !</stage>      <l>This is too hot : some snow to cool it : so —</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <stage>He gives a cry and falls headlong . His limbs quiver a moment and then are still . Meanwhile the shower of roses has slackened . There is a dead silence , and in the silence slowly all the guests turn and look at NERO , who rises , with the emerald in his eye .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NERO</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Lift up the prince and bear him to his room .</l>
      <l>I do entreat that none of you will stir</l>
      <l>Or rise perturbed : my brother , since his birth ,</l>
      <l>Was ever thus : the fit will pass from him .</l>
      <l>Refill the cups : proceed we with the feast !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <stage>There is an attempt to renew the feasting , but soon a scene of uproar and confusion arises , and the guests leave the tables in alarm .</stage>

       <l>Who , from their smouldering homes , curse thee aloud .</l>

<stage>The flame flashes upward . Rage ! Rage on ! See , see ! How beautiful ! Like a rose magnificently burning ! [ The flame flashes up . Rage on ! Thou art that which poets use , Or which consumes them . Thou art in me ! Thou dreadful womb of mighty spirits , And crimson sepulchre of them ! [ The flame flashes up . Blaze ! Blaze ! How it eats and eats ! How it drinks ! What hunger is like unto the hunger of fire ? What thirst is like unto the thirst of flame ? [ The flame flashes up . O fury superb ! O incurable lust of ruin ! O panting perdition ! O splendid devastation ! I , I , too , have felt it ! To destroy — to destroy ! To leave behind me ashes , ashes . [ The flame flashes up . Rage ! Rage on ! Or art thou passion , art thou desire ? Ah ! terrible kiss ! [ The flame flashes up . Now hear it , hear it ! A hiss as from mighty serpents , The dry , licking , wicked tongues ! Wouldst thou sting the earth to death ? What a career ! To clasp and devour and kill ! To dance over the world as a frenzied dancer With whirling skirts of world-wide flame ! [ The flame flashes up . Blaze ! Blaze ! Or art thou madness visible , Insanity seizing the rolling heavens . [ He points up . Thou , Thou , didst create the world In the stars innumerably smiling . Thou art life , thou art God , thou art I ! [ The flame flashes up . Mother ! Mother ! This is thy deed . Hist ! Hist ! can you not see her Stealing with lighted torch ? She makes no sound , she hath a spirit 's tread . Hast thou sated thy vengeance yet ? Art thou appeased ? [ The flame flashes up . Be satisfied with nothing but the world , The world alone is fuel for thee . Mother ! [ The flame flashes up . And I ! See what a fire I have given thee , Rome for a funeral couch ! Had Achilles a pyre like to this Or had Patroclus ? Had they mourners such as I give to thee , Bereaved mothers and babes ? Now let the wailing cease from thy tomb , Here is a mightier wail ! Now let the haunting trumpet be dumb !</stage>       <l>This fire is not the act of mortal mind ,</l>
       <l>But is the huge conception of a spirit</l>
       <l>Dreaming beyond the tomb a mighty thought .</l>
       <l>She would express herself in burning fire :</l>
       <l>This is the awful vengeance of the dead ;</l>
       <l>This is my mother Agrippina 's deed .</l>
       <l>I will not baulk the fury of her spirit .</l>
       <l>No ! Let her glut her anger on the city ,</l>
       <l>For only Rome in ashes can appease her ,</l>
       <l>Let the fire rage and purge me of her blood !</l>
