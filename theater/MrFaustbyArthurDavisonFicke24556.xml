    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">Through all the work of Arthur Davison Ficke runs a note of bigness that compels attention even when one feels that he is still groping both for form and thought . In “ Mr. Faust ” this note has assumed commanding proportions , while at the same time the uncertainty manifest in some of the earlier work has almost wholly disappeared . Intellectually as well as artistically , this play shows a surprising maturity . It impresses me , for one , as the expression of a well-rounded and very profound philosophy of life — and this philosophy stands in logical and sympathetic relationship to what the western world to-day regards as its most advanced thought . The evolutionary conception of life is the foundation of that philosophy , which , however , has little or nothing in common with the materialistic and dogmatic evolutionism of the last century . The work sprung from that philosophy is full of the new sense of mystery , which makes the men of to-day realize that the one attitude leading nowhere is that of denial . Faith and doubt walk hand in hand , each one being to the other check and goad alike . And with this new freedom to believe as well as to question , man becomes once more the centre of his known universe . But there he stands , humbly proud , not as the arrogant master of a “ dead ” world , but merely as the foremost servant of a life-principle which asserts itself in the grain of sand as in the brain of man .</p>
    <p n="2">Yet “ Mr. Faust ” is by no means a philosophical or moral tract . It is , first of all and throughout , a living , breathing work of art , instinct with beauty and faithful in its every line to the principle laid down by its author in the preface to one of his earlier volumes : “ Poetical imagination must fail altogether if it descends from its natural sphere and assumes work which is properly that of economic or political experience . Nor can it usefully urge its own peculiar intuitions as things of practical validity . ”</p>
    <p n="3">Mr. Ficke was born in 1883 at Davenport , Iowa , and there he is still living , although I understand that he has since then been wandering in so many other regions , physical and spiritual , that he can hardly call it his home . He graduated from Harvard in 1904 and spent the next travelling in all sorts of strange and poetic places — Japan , India , the Greek mountains , the Aegean Islands . Returning to the United States , he studied law and was admitted to the Bar in 1908 . While studying , he taught English for a year at the University of Iowa , lecturing on the history of the Arthurian Legends .</p>
    <p n="4">He was a mere boy when he began to write , turning from the first to the metrical form of expression and remaining faithful to it in most of his subsequent efforts . His poems and essays have been printed in almost all the leading magazines . So far he has published five volumes of verse : “ From the Isles , ” a series of lyrics of the Aegean Sea ; “ The Happy Princess , ” a romantic narrative poem ; “ The Earth Passion , ” a series of poems which may be characterized as the effort of a star-gazer to find satisfaction in the things of the earth ; “ The Breaking of Bonds , ” a Shelleyan drama of social unrest , where he has tried to formulate a hope for our final emergence from the maelstrom of class-conflict ; and “ Twelve Japanese Painters , ” a group of poems expressive of the peculiar and alluring charm of the great Japanese painters and their world of remote beauty .</p>

      <stage type="setting">
       <stage>The scene is the library of John Faust , a large handsome room panelled in dark oak and lined with rows of books in open book-shelves . On the right is a carved white stone fireplace , with deep chairs before it . In the far left corner of the room , on a pedestal , stands a stiff bust of George Washington . Near it hangs a wonderful Titian portrait , a thing of another world . The furniture looks as if it were , and probably is , plunder from the palace of some prince of the Renaissance .</stage>
       <stage>A fire is burning in the fireplace ; it , and several shaded lights , make a subdued brilliancy in the room . Before the fire sits John Faust . Brander and Oldham , both in evening dress , lounge comfortably in chairs near Faust . All three are smoking , and tall highball glasses stand within their reach .</stage>

        <l>You are a thorn to me , a thorn in the flesh .</l>
        <l>Contagiously you bring to me mistrust</l>
        <l>Of all my landmarks , when , as here to-night ,</l>
        <l>Out of the midst of every pleasant gift</l>
        <l>The world can offer you , you raise your voice</l>
        <l>In scoffing irony against each face ,</l>
        <l>Form , action , motive , that together make</l>
        <l>Your life , and ours .</l>

        <l>Your attitude to-night ; you always seem</l>

        <l>Dear Brander ! Is it true</l>
        <l>I am as bad as that ? Well , though I were ,</l>
        <l>Why should it trouble you ? If you find sport</l>
        <l>In this strange game , this fevered interplay ,</l>
        <l>This hodge-podge crazy-quilt which we are pleased</l>
        <l>To call our life — why , like it ! And say : Damned</l>

        <l>Faust , might I presume so far</l>
        <l>As to suggest that I should like a drink</l>
        <l>Before you two start breaking furniture</l>
        <l>Over this matter ?</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>FAUST</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Certainly ; I beg</l>
        <l>Your pardon ; I neglected you .</l>

      <stage>He busies himself with the glasses</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>No , no ,</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>We wo n't wage combat over this . You 're right ,</l>
        <l>Doubtless , as usual , Brander . I have not</l>
        <l>Your fortunate placidity of mind ,</l>
        <l>And I get grumpy .</l>
        <l>Come , fill up your glass ;</l>
        <l>And let us drink to the glories of the world .</l>
        <l>Down with the cynic !</l>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRANDER</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Down with him , indeed !</l>
        <l>And may he cease to trouble you . The world</l>
        <l>Is pretty glorious when a man is young ,</l>
        <l>As we are , and so many splendid choices</l>
        <l>Lie all around him . There have never been</l>
        <l>Such opportunities as now are spread</l>
        <l>Before us . Men are doing mighty things</l>
        <l>To-day . A critic tells me that last night</l>
        <l>Wullf at the opera sang “ La ci darem ”</l>
        <l>With an artistic brilliancy of tone</l>
        <l>That never has been heard on any stage</l>
        <l>Anywhere in the world . You moped at home ,</l>
        <l>Doubtless ; but it was wonderful , on my word .</l>
       </lg>

      <sp>

       <p>Whom did you go with ?</p>

       <p>Midge .</p>
      </sp>

       <speaker>OLDHAM</speaker>
       <p>Ah , Midge again ! I thought so ....</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRANDER</speaker>
       <p>Well , I do n't know why I should n't .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLDHAM</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Those rosy-toned remarks gave you away .</l>
        <l>Perhaps ‘ twas not “ Don Juan ” that last night</l>
        <l>Was at its best , but Midge . Where did you sit ?</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRANDER</speaker>
       <p>Up in the gallery .</p>

       <p>The top one ?</p>
      </sp>

       <speaker>BRANDER</speaker>
       <p>Yes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLDHAM</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Once more , I thought so . You and Midge would look</l>
        <l>Nice in a box ! Yes , I will pay for one</l>
        <l>If you will take it .</l>
       </lg>

       <p>Who is this “ Midge ” you speak of ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLDHAM</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Midge , dear Faust ,</l>
        <l>Is short for Margaret ; which , you may guess ,</l>
        <l>Describes a lady of the female sex ;</l>
        <l>Said person being serviceably employed</l>
        <l>As maid-of-all-work for some ancient dame</l>
        <l>In Brander 's own apartment house . She has ,</l>
        <l>Beside what other virtues I know not ,</l>
        <l>A most bewitching ankle and a taste</l>
        <l>For opera . And dear Brander 's kindly heart</l>
        <l>Is so moved by the sight of these combined ,</l>
        <l>He sometimes sneaks , by lonely alley-ways ,</l>
        <l>With his fair Midge , and in the gallery</l>
        <l>High out of sight of all of us enjoys</l>
        <l>Her and the opera .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>FAUST</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>I did not know</l>
        <l>You had a lady-love .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRANDER</speaker>
       <p>It 's hardly that ! But she 's a mighty jolly little thing .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>FAUST</speaker>
       <p>What sort of girl is she ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRANDER</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>A mighty nice one !</l>
        <l>Full of all kinds of happiness ; but shy .</l>
        <l>I 'd like to see some rounder try to speak</l>
        <l>To her on Broadway . She looks like a lady !</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>FAUST</speaker>
       <p>That is too bad .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>BRANDER</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Oh , pshaw ! Do n't lecture me ;</l>
        <l>I 'm not a saint ; in fact , few of us are .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>FAUST</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Unfortunately not . I least of all .</l>
        <l>And yet I wonder if .... However , I</l>
        <l>Do not presume to lecture you . Remember</l>
        <l>One thing , though , as my friend . Your Midge has deeps</l>
        <l>Not pleasant under her if you let go .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>BRANDER</speaker>
       <p>Oh , I will not let go !... Not yet , at least .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLDHAM</speaker>
       <p>Faust really means it , strange as it may seem . Of late he has turned moralist .</p>

       <speaker>FAUST</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Not quite :</l>
        <l>But just a little tired of pursuits</l>
        <l>That end regretfully .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>OLDHAM</speaker>
       <p>Well , do n't pursue ....</p>

        <stage>Goes to the window and raises the shade</stage>
        <l>See , what a night it is ! The stars are out</l>
        <l>As if a bucketful of them had spilled</l>
        <l>Across the sky . And here we sit like owls ,</l>
        <l>Blinking and staring at a little fire</l>
        <l>When heaven is burning ! I 'm afraid it 's time</l>
        <l>For me to leave this owlish parliament ;</l>
        <l>And I shall probably knock holes in half</l>
        <l>The windows of the town as I walk home</l>
        <l>Star-gazingly . And here it 's after twelve !</l>
        <l>I might have guessed it from the fatal fact</l>
        <l>That we 'd begun to talk philosophy :</l>
        <l>No sane man ever does , except in hours</l>
        <l>When by all rights he should be sound asleep .</l>
        <l>Good night to both of you . And do n't stay up</l>

        <l>I am revolving in my brain</l>
        <l>This serious question : whether ‘ tis not best</l>
        <l>That one turn humorist . The mind that seeks</l>
        <l>Holiness , finds it seldom ; who pursues</l>
        <l>Beauty perhaps shall in a lengthened life</l>
        <l>Find it perfected only once or twice .</l>
        <l>But if one 's quest were humor — what rich stores ,</l>
        <l>What tropic jungles of it , lie to hand</l>
        <l>At every moment , everywhere one turns —</l>
        <l>What luscious meadows for the humorist !</l>

       <speaker>OLDHAM</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>No — for the satirist ! There is no humor</l>
        <l>In what you see and I see when we look</l>
        <l>On this crude world wherein our lives are spent —</l>
        <l>This sordid sphere where we are but spectators —</l>
        <l>This crass grim modern spectacle of lives</l>
        <l>Torn with consuming lust of one desire —</l>
        <l>Gold , gold , forever gold — Or do you find</l>

        <l>There 's no joke in it !</l>
        <l>It is the waste , the pitiful waste of life !</l>
        <l>Men — slaves to gather gold — become then slaves</l>
        <l>Beneath its gathered weight . For this one hope ,</l>
        <l>All finer longings perish at their birth .</l>
        <l>Men 's eyes to-day envy no sage or seer</l>
        <l>Or conqueror except his triumphs be</l>
        <l>In this base sphere of commerce . The stars go out</l>
        <l>In factory smoke ; the spirit wanes and pales</l>
        <l>In poisoned air of greed . It is an age</l>
        <l>Of traders and of tricksters ; all the high</l>
        <l>And hounded malefactors of great wealth</l>
        <l>Differ from the masses , in their wealth , indeed ;</l>
        <l>But in their malefaction , not at all .</l>
        <l>Your grocer and my butcher have at heart</l>
        <l>The selfsame aims as he to whom we pay</l>
        <l>Tribute for every pound of coal we burn .</l>
        <l>Their scope is narrower , but their act the same</l>
        <l>As his — against whose millions all the tongues</l>

        <l>Angelo , Leonardo , Botticelli —</l>

        <l>Your Renaissance , despite its few bright gleams ,</l>

        <l>Of slaughtered cities and corrupted thrones —</l>
        <l>Yes , even the Papal throne — draw me not back</l>
        <l>With longing toward it . Rich that time might be</l>
        <l>If one were Michael Angelo ; but how</l>
        <l>If one were peasant , or meek householder ,</l>
        <l>When the Free Captains ravaged to and fro ,</l>
        <l>And peoples were the merest pawns of kings</l>
        <l>Enslaved by mistresses ? The more I look ,</l>
        <l>The more evaporates that golden haze</l>
        <l>Which cloaks the past ; the more I doubt if men</l>
        <l>Had ever in their breasts more lofty souls</l>

        <l>In Argolis , a woman , somewhat vain ,</l>
        <l>Preferred a fop to her own rightful lord</l>

        <l>The might of Hellas on the Trojan plain</l>
        <l>Grappled in conflict such as had been mete</l>
        <l>To guard Olympus , and Scamander ran</l>
        <l>Red with heroic blood-drops . And they got</l>

        <l>That was your Golden Age . I hope you like it .</l>
        <l>Foolishness !... Once a mariner set forth ,</l>

        <l>And godlike courage on his brow , to find</l>
        <l>New worlds beyond the unknown wastes of sea .</l>
        <l>He sailed ; he found ; he died in rusty chains :</l>
        <l>So that , to-day , the vermin of all climes</l>

        <l>I pay you my respects ; you are a light</l>

        <l>Unsceptical of bricks , but such as lay</l>

        <l>At prescient thought of how your edifice</l>
        <l>Might be turned pest-house some day . Undismayed</l>
        <l>By doubt , you rose , and in heroic mould</l>
        <l>Led — dauntless , patient , incorruptible —</l>
        <l>A riot over taxes . Not a star</l>
        <l>In all the vaults of heaven could trouble you</l>
        <l>With whisperings of more transcendent goals .</l>

      <stage>The bust of Washington and its pedestal move slightly ; gradually they change and shape themselves into the figure of a well-dressed man , rather short and stocky , with a sociable , commonplace face . His head , however , is very peculiarly modelled ; it reminds one , indescribably and faintly , of the fact that men sprang from beasts . The high position of the ears help this impression , as does also the astonishing animal brilliance of the eyes . Faust , passing his hand over his forehead , turns away .</stage>

       <speaker>FAUST</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Nicholas Satan ! Quite a name . Perhaps</l>
        <l>Some relative of the illustrious one ?</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
       <p>Himself .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>FAUST</speaker>
       <p>Stop this cheap foolishness ! Who are you ? Or shall I ring for the police ?</p>

       <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>I am</l>
        <l>Satan . If I appeared with colored fire</l>
        <l>And lightnings round me , you would doubt no more .</l>
        <l>But like your narrow and near-sighted age ,</l>
        <l>You know me not in my own natural shape .</l>
        <l>Now let this end ! Here is my proof . You once</l>
        <l>Summoned me to your aid , and , when I came ,</l>
        <l>Weakly rejected me . You were a boy</l>
        <l>In college , and a woman blackmailed you —</l>
        <l>A low , crude matter . I had settled it</l>
        <l>Swiftly , if you had let me . We alone ,</l>
        <l>We three , on Harvard Bridge — night — and beneath ,</l>
        <l>A practicable river : ah , it was</l>
        <l>A child 's task ! But you faltered .... You recall ,</l>
        <l>Possibly .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>FAUST</speaker>
       <p>I recall .... So you are he . I did not know you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
       <p>Let 's forget the past . We meet now under happier auspices .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>FAUST</speaker>
       <p>Incredible .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>No , quite an honest fact</l>
        <l>Am I .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>FAUST</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>I hardly can persuade myself</l>
        <l>Whether to laugh or pull a solemn face</l>
        <l>At seeing you . It is preposterous !</l>
        <l>I thought that you were dead — a myth — a wraith .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
       <p>Dead ? That is rich !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>FAUST</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Well ... do n't you think yourself</l>
        <l>A slight anachronism ?</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>My young friend ,</l>
        <l>I am no laughing matter . With the times</l>
        <l>I , too , have changed , and am as up-to-date</l>
        <l>As the Ritz-Carlton .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>FAUST</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>But your horns and tail</l>
        <l>And pitchfork ? Not a vestige do I see</l>
        <l>Of your famed look ! You have no frightful glance ;</l>
        <l>I cannot even so far flatter you</l>
        <l>As to say special badness makes your face</l>
        <l>Great and distinguished . If you 're Prince of Hell ,</l>
        <l>How villanously have the poets lied !</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>They have lied , always , horribly , of me !</l>
        <l>I am not half so black as they allege .</l>
        <l>You know , exaggeration is to them</l>
        <l>What whiskey is to most men . But time bursts</l>
        <l>Their bubbles — or at least we come to take</l>
        <l>Their work as merely art . Thus their description</l>
        <l>As art is not so bad ; but if you seek</l>
        <l>For truth , it 's outright libel .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>FAUST</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>I admit</l>
        <l>It has a certain perfectness of evil</l>
        <l>Lacking in you .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Surely to-day we know</l>
        <l>That nothing is so wholly good or bad</l>
        <l>As our forefathers thought : not black and white ,</l>
        <l>But gray , predominates . Well , I am gray ,</l>
        <l>Possibly . I was never black ; and age</l>
        <l>Has made me stouter , and with gentle warmth</l>
        <l>Ripened my virtues ; and , even though I say it ,</l>
        <l>You will not find me a bad sort to meet</l>
        <l>If you will but be fair , and put aside</l>
        <l>Your ancient and poetic prejudice .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>FAUST</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Well spoken ! And well met ! Come , have a drink .</l>
        <l>You are the most diverting visitor</l>
        <l>I 've had in many a day . Bourbon or Scotch ?</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>A very little Scotch . That 's plenty , thanks .</l>
        <l>It 's very seldom those who summon me</l>
        <l>Would give , not take . And did you send for me</l>
        <l>Only to have a drink ?</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>FAUST</speaker>
       <p>I sent for you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
       <p>Did you not summon me ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>FAUST</speaker>
       <p>Why , no —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
       <p>Ah , well ! It 's my mistake ; wires get crossed sometimes . I hope I 've not intruded .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>FAUST</speaker>
       <p>Not at all . Delighted to have met you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>I regret</l>
        <l>That I have bothered you . I have enjoyed ,</l>
        <l>However , your kind hospitality .</l>
        <l>To make amends to you , before I go ,</l>
        <l>I should be glad to do you any service</l>
        <l>Within my power .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>FAUST</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>I thank you ; but I think</l>
        <l>That there is nothing in your special line</l>
        <l>That I have need of .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Are you really , then ,</l>
        <l>A man contented ?</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>FAUST</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>I would hardly go</l>
        <l>As far as that !... I only meant to say</l>
        <l>My needs , my troubles , are not of such kind</l>
        <l>As you could remedy .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Now , there again</l>
        <l>You take the poets ’ word for me — those low</l>
        <l>And scurvy fellows who lump all their spleen</l>
        <l>And call the mess my portrait ! But in fact ,</l>
        <l>I am more versatile , more broad , more kind</l>
        <l>Than they conceive . I venture to believe</l>
        <l>That I could aid you .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>FAUST</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>All the fiends in Hell</l>
        <l>Lack devilry enough .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>If you would speak</l>
        <l>The symptoms of your trouble , I at least</l>
        <l>Could give you friendly counsel for your needs ....</l>
        <l>Oh , I am deeply learned !</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>FAUST</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>And besides ,</l>
        <l>A most accomplished mocker !... My complaint</l>
        <l>Is quite beyond your counsel . Why , I tell you ,</l>
        <l>I have examined , tried , experienced</l>
        <l>The passions and the aims of mortal life</l>
        <l>With the grave thoroughness and good intent</l>
        <l>That mark a doctor of philosophy</l>
        <l>Writing his thesis . And my careful search</l>
        <l>Of life has brought me one great verity :</l>
        <l>I do not like it ! No , I do not like</l>
        <l>Anything in it : birth , death , all that lies</l>
        <l>Between — I find inadequate , incomplete ,</l>
        <l>Offensive . So you see me sitting here ,</l>
        <l>Instead of talking politics in the streets ,</l>
        <l>Or weeping at the opera , or agog</l>
        <l>At a cotillon . For the savor 's gone</l>
        <l>From these , as parts of an unsavored whole .</l>
        <l>I simply have , with reason and sound thought ,</l>
        <l>Convinced myself that only fools attain</l>
        <l>Their hope on earth — in a fools ’ paradise</l>
        <l>That does not interest me .... Now , could you treat</l>
        <l>This case , good Mr. Satan ?</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>In my day ,</l>
        <l>I have relieved far sicker men than you ,</l>
        <l>My dear friend Faust . And yet I would not say</l>
        <l>Even for a moment that your case is not</l>
        <l>A grave one : not so much the case itself ,</l>
        <l>As what might spring from it . In such a mood ,</l>
        <l>Men sometimes have done mad and foolish things</l>
        <l>With consequences sad to view . Some minds ,</l>
        <l>Reaching your state , and finding life a bane ,</l>
        <l>Decide within themselves that naught can be</l>
        <l>Worse than the present world , and then set out</l>
        <l>To revolutionize , rend , whirl , uproot</l>
        <l>The world 's foundations . And the mess they make</l>
        <l>Is pitiful to contemplate ! Such sweet</l>
        <l>And beautiful souls as I have seen go wrong</l>
        <l>Along this path : Shelley — he had your eyes ;</l>
        <l>And Christ — but I 'll not talk theology .</l>
        <l>Besides , his churches almost have made good</l>
        <l>His personal havoc ....</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>FAUST</speaker>
       <p>That is not my line .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>No , no , you keep your head ! Now let me see ....</l>
        <l>A temporary sedative you require</l>
        <l>To bridge the dangerous moment . I suggest</l>
        <l>A little course that old Saint Anthony ,</l>
        <l>Epicure though he was , would grant as rare</l>
        <l>And finely chosen : careless days and nights —</l>
        <l>Delicious gayeties — the Bacchic bowl —</l>
        <l>Exquisite company from whom some two</l>
        <l>Or three , with golden or with auburn hair ,</l>
        <l>A man of taste might choose to solace him</l>
        <l>In sunlight or in starlight — while the lure</l>
        <l>Of subtle secrets in those yielding breasts</l>
        <l>Spice the preceding revelries ....</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>FAUST</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Go tell</l>
        <l>That tale to college boys , whose lonely dreams</l>
        <l>Have shaped Iseult of Ireland , Helen of Troy ,</l>
        <l>As end of heart 's desire — and , lacking these ,</l>
        <l>Clasp chorus-Aphrodites . But I know</l>
        <l>That from the topmost peak of ecstasy</l>
        <l>Falls a straight precipice ; half-times the foot</l>
        <l>Misses the peak — but never mortal step</l>
        <l>Has missed the gulf beyond it . And I see</l>
        <l>Where , in night 's gorgeous dome , to-morrow waits</l>
        <l>With cold insistence . Me you cannot lure</l>
        <l>With this poor opiate . And I beg of you</l>
        <l>Not needlessly to tax your mental powers</l>
        <l>By now suggesting the delights of drink :</l>
        <l>I know them ; and they give me headaches .</l>
       </lg>

      <sp>
       <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Ah ,</l>
        <l>How crude you think me !</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>FAUST</speaker>
       <p>No , I think you human . We all are that sometimes .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>You have not grasped</l>
        <l>All that I meant . I know the calfish joys</l>
        <l>Of the young freshman , suddenly let loose</l>
        <l>With chorus-girls for nursemaids , are not yours .</l>
        <l>I mean far subtler things : I mean the play</l>
        <l>Of the wise soul that sees the abyss of life —</l>
        <l>Sees the grim measure of the mortal doom —</l>
        <l>And over that dark gulf in reckless mirth</l>
        <l>Dances on rainbows , with delightful arms</l>
        <l>And bosoms close to his . That is a mood</l>
        <l>That always thrills me with a sense of large</l>
        <l>And splendid courage . If I did not think</l>
        <l>That it would bore you , I should like to make</l>
        <l>My meaning clear by reading a few lines</l>
        <l>That I once wrote when I myself was in</l>
        <l>Your very mood — Or would you care to hear</l>
        <l>My little poem ?</l>

      <sp>
       <speaker>FAUST</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>What ! Is even the Devil</l>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
       <p>Indeed he is : And not a bad one . Once I would have scorned The poets ; but we moderns so surpass The ancients here that I am proud to write Some verses now and then . For we have learned That poetry , like all the other arts , Is pure technique : the mere ideas are nothing , The form is everything . That ennobles us And makes us artists . And as artist , I Am not contemptible , as you may see From this slight sample . With your leave , I 'll read .<stage>Satan produces an enormous scrap-book of magazine-clippings , turns over the pages and at last begins to read</stage>A WATTEAU MELODY Oh , let me take your lily hand , And where the secret star-beams shine Draw near , to see and understand Pierrot and Columbine . Around the fountains , in the dew , Where afternoon melts into night , With gracious mirth their gracious crew Entice the shy birds of delight . Of motley dress and maskèd face , Of sparkling unrevealing eyes , They track in gentle aimless chase The moment as it flies . Their delicate beribboned rout , Gallant and fair , of light intent , Weaves through the shadows in and out With infinite artful merriment . Dear lady of the lily hand — Do then our stars so clearly shine That we , who do not understand , May mock Pierrot and Columbine ? Beyond this garden-grove I see The wise , the noble , and the brave In ultimate futility Go down into the grave . And all they dreamed and all they sought , Crumbled and ashen grown , departs ; And is as if they had not wrought These works with blood from out their hearts . The nations fall , the faiths decay , The great philosophies go by — And life lies bare , some bitter day , A charnel that affronts the sky . The wise , the noble , and the brave — They saw and solved — as we must see And solve — the universal grave , The ultimate futility . Look — where beside the garden-pool A Venus rises in the grove , More suave , more debonair , more cool Than ever burned with Paphian love . ‘ Twas here the delicate ribboned rout Of gallants and the fair ones went Among the shadows in and out With infinite artful merriment . Then let me take your lily hand , And let us tread , where star-beams shine , A dance ; and be , and understand Pierrot and Columbine .</p>

        <l>Well , as art</l>
        <l>I think it splendid ; as philosophy ,</l>
        <l>I hardly praise it . ‘ Tis a mood that comes</l>

        <l>Yes , irresistibly . But past the hour</l>
        <l>Wait graver judges . I decline to be ,</l>
        <l>As you suggest delightfully , a fly</l>
        <l>On the spoiled beer of life . Nor do I lean</l>

        <l>Do not jest . I offer you</l>
        <l>The one sole reservoir where power to-day</l>
        <l>Lies stored in sleeping cataracts . At noon</l>
        <l>Come with me into Wall Street ; take your stand ;</l>
        <l>Buy , sell , as I direct you ; and one hour</l>
        <l>Shall make you richer than you ever dreamed</l>
        <l>In madness of desire . For three days more</l>
        <l>Come there each noon again ; at end of these ,</l>
        <l>If you have done my bidding , you shall be</l>
        <l>Master of the finances of the world ,</l>
        <l>Despot of nations , unto whom the kings</l>
        <l>And captains of the earth shall kneel to crave</l>
        <l>Crumbs from the table . Then let pen and sword</l>
        <l>Forget their quarrel for supremacy ;</l>
        <l>Since you can buy them both , or starve them both ,</l>
        <l>Or cast them to the wilderness ! Such power</l>
        <l>I offer as would make the pulses beat</l>
        <l>Even of a skeleton !</l>

        <l>But not a soul</l>
        <l>Grown sceptical of life . Power ? Power ? For what ?</l>
        <l>And over what ? And toward what ? Not a power</l>
        <l>Over myself or pain or loneliness</l>
        <l>Or ignorance or evil ; not a strength</l>
        <l>To bid the near-world cease , and in its place</l>
        <l>Instate my visions beautiful and pale ,</l>
        <l>Nearer the heart 's desire . No , you would give</l>
        <l>Power to direct the miseries of men ,</l>
        <l>But not to stay them : power to hold the world</l>
        <l>As some cold robber-baron from his rocks</l>
        <l>Once held his little valley : power to sit</l>
        <l>In ultimate seclusion , and look down</l>
        <l>On streets and mines and workshops with the sense</l>
        <l>That I was fountain of the miseries</l>
        <l>Dark in them all . I thank you ; but I think</l>
        <l>I should derive small sport from such a game .</l>

        <l>Well , you are</l>
        <l>A subtle one , a shrewd one ! On my word ,</l>
        <l>I hardly had suspected you so deep .</l>
        <l>What time I have been wasting ! Mr. Faust ,</l>
        <l>At last I know you for a prince of men —</l>
        <l>A brilliant mind , a high intelligence ,</l>
        <l>A spirit incorruptible . The trash ,</l>
        <l>Baubles and claptrap which the foolish herd</l>
        <l>Snatch at , you scoff — and rightly . I will not</l>
        <l>With one more word of it insult your mind</l>
        <l>That admirably penetrates to deeps</l>
        <l>Where I , too , love to dwell . I put aside</l>
        <l>All trivialities , and frankly say</l>
        <l>That I can offer you one ultimate gift</l>
        <l>Fit even for you — a subtle paradise</l>
        <l>Such as not Hercules mid Western Isles</l>
        <l>Found in the Garden of Hesperides .</l>
        <l>It is a paradise of secret peace ,</l>
        <l>A glorious land of amaranthine bloom ;</l>
        <l>Where happiness , having fled the world , now dwells</l>
        <l>In shining gladness . Guarded , deep , sublime</l>
        <l>With lights and shadows , lies it : there have hearts</l>
        <l>The weariest and the greatest of mankind</l>
        <l>Found perfect refuge and abiding-place</l>
        <l>For time and for eternity . To few</l>
        <l>Its gates are open : it I promise you</l>
        <l>If you but trust me !</l>

       <speaker>FAUST</speaker>

        <l>But why should I trust you ?</l>
        <l>If history speaks true , you have deceived</l>
        <l>All who , since Eve , have put their faith in you .</l>
        <l>Further , your paradise could hardly have</l>
        <l>Joys in it worth the grasping , to my taste .</l>

        <l>You doubt me still .</l>
        <l>But I will prove my utter honesty</l>
        <l>Beyond contention . In my deepest soul ,</l>
        <l>I know this paradise will serve your need ;</l>
        <l>And to make plain to you my fair intent ,</l>
        <l>I offer you a bargain whose clear terms</l>
        <l>Must drive your doubts away . I am prepared</l>
        <l>To pledge myself to be your abject slave</l>
        <l>And servant for all time if you yourself</l>
        <l>Do not acknowledge that my paradise</l>
        <l>Delights you wholly !</l>

       <lg>
        <l>What could be fairer ? You yourself shall judge ;</l>
        <l>And you risk nothing . Ah , your look still doubts !</l>
        <l>You have in mind those libellous poets ’ tales</l>
        <l>Of bonds inscribed in blood which I exact</l>
        <l>In payment , and destroy men 's souls ! My friend ,</l>
        <l>Have I yet asked you for a bond of blood ?</l>
        <l>And if I ever do , I give you leave</l>
        <l>To wring my neck unceremoniously .</l>

       <lg>
        <l>Well , for the life of me , I cannot read you !</l>
        <l>Yet let me ask : why such an eager will</l>
        <l>To serve a man into whose rooms you came</l>
        <l>By chance to-night ? Why give yourself such pains</l>
        <l>To furnish him a paradise ?</l>
       </lg>

       <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>There is</l>

        <l>You to myself .</l>
       </lg>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>FAUST</speaker>

       <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>You fail</l>

        <l>As promise of you .</l>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>FAUST</speaker>

        <l>What , then , do you mean ?</l>
        <l>What do you count on ? Whence do you expect</l>
        <l>Pay for your trouble and your risk — a risk</l>
        <l>Not trivial , I warn you ?</l>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>Let me make</l>
        <l>The matter clear to you . I know quite well</l>
        <l>The risk is nothing , since my paradise</l>
        <l>Will utterly delight you . Granting this ,</l>
        <l>You see my profit : you will stay with me</l>
        <l>Willingly there forever , to my ends</l>
        <l>An interested assistant . I will serve</l>
        <l>Forth on my tables such delicious fare</l>
        <l>That you will freely choose to be my guest</l>
        <l>Through time and through eternity . I say :</l>
        <l>Fie for a bond written in scrawly blood !</l>
        <l>A bond of choice is better . Could a saint</l>
        <l>Speak fairer to you ? I risk everything ,</l>
        <l>And you risk nothing but a little time ;</l>
        <l>And time , as you are placed , seems not so dear</l>
        <l>That you need hoard it .</l>

        <l>I accept .</l>
        <l>Your game is to my taste . For thirty years</l>

        <l>The realms of learning , and the tangled groves</l>
        <l>Of fancy , for some region which my soul</l>
        <l>Might with entire approval view ; but none</l>
        <l>Has been vouchsafed me . If the Devil can</l>
        <l>In this surpass the world 's established powers ,</l>
        <l>Then I am his disciple willingly ....</l>
        <l>But if you fail , friend Satan !— I shall tie</l>
        <l>You to a cart 's tail and exhibit you</l>
        <l>Like a dead whale throughout the country — or</l>
        <l>Make you curator of an orphanage !</l>

       <stage>The scene is the stone-paved courtyard of a ruined temple . In the centre lies a square pool , with wide rows of steps leading down to the water , now overgrown with lotus plants . Around the court rise long colonnades of pillars with grotesquely carven bases and capitals of luxuriant design . Beyond these appear green masses of dense tropical foliage , in which an occasional brilliant flower shines .</stage>
       <stage>Faust , Satan and Oldham , all wearing white tropical dress and sun-helmets , are seated on fragments of fallen columns in front of the pool . Luncheon is spread before them . Oldham is lighting a cigarette ; Faust is just finishing his meal ; Satan is leaning back , contemplating the surrounding jungle . Two dark-skinned servants , wearing white robes and turbans , are beginning to bear away the repast .</stage>

        <l>And the white foam along the glassy waves</l>
        <l>Played in the evening light — I half believe</l>

        <l>Recompense ? I am sceptical of it !</l>
        <l>But we deserve this . None but idiots</l>
        <l>Would have come with you to this boiling land</l>
        <l>On a wild-goose chase ; on each step of which</l>
        <l>One gets a fleeting panoramic view</l>
        <l>Of kinds of misery one did not guess</l>
        <l>Existed in the world . Those lepers , beggars ,</l>
        <l>Cripples , fanatics , reptiles — all the swarms</l>
        <l>Of loathsome creatures we have passed — will haunt</l>
        <l>My dreams forever with new vivid masks</l>
        <l>Of nightmare . Recompense ? There is n't any !</l>

        <l>Through our long journey , secretive and close</l>
        <l>Of all your purposes — from day to day</l>
        <l>Giving no hint of your to-morrow 's plan</l>
        <l>Nor of our destination . Now , I think ,</l>
        <l>Silence is not a virtue . Have we come</l>

        <l>Built in forgotten times to unknown gods ,</l>
        <l>And now in timeless solitude enfolded ,</l>
        <l>Has long been known to me . Here , in retreat</l>
        <l>From the world 's noises , dwells a holy man ,</l>
        <l>A wonder-worker of unfathomed power ,</l>
        <l>Now long forgotten by the troubled world</l>
        <l>Except me only . ‘ Tis his aged hand</l>

        <l>You must know that in my youth</l>
        <l>I was a lusty noble of the realm</l>
        <l>Of Jeypore ; and the falcon and the sword</l>
        <l>And the nautch-dancers and the palace-girls</l>
        <l>Were mine to love and master like a lord .</l>
        <l>Lordlike I lived ; the caskets of the day</l>
        <l>And of the night I crowded with bright jewels</l>
        <l>Of love and joy and laughter . No desire</l>
        <l>Panted unslaked an instant at my doors —</l>
        <l>Nay , feasts were spread for it . And poor men gazed</l>
        <l>On me with envy , muttering from their dust :</l>
        <l>“ Behold , the Heavens ’ darling . ” ...</l>

        <l>One night , alone in mine own garden walls ,</l>
        <l>Beneath the piercing stars , I gathered my life</l>
        <l>Into my hands , and looked at it , and far</l>
        <l>Beyond it at all other mortal lives ;</l>
        <l>And dust fell from mine eyelids ....</l>
       </lg>

        <l>Recurrent yearning that is never stilled ,</l>
        <l>Agony , death , rebirth in other forms ,</l>
        <l>And agony , and desire , and agony .</l>
        <l>But nowhere saw I happiness or peace</l>
        <l>Or rest from cravings that like vultures tear</l>
        <l>The fibres of the heart .</l>
        <l>Then wandered I</l>
        <l>Forth from my palaces in utter pain ,</l>
        <l>Seeing the world as dust and vanity ,</l>
        <l>A desert of despair , a raging sea</l>

        <l>I am refreshed ....</l>
        <l>Thus long ago , in my most desolate hour ,</l>
        <l>I was refreshed by draughts from the deep springs</l>
        <l>Of light . Beneath a pipal tree I sat</l>
        <l>In lost despair ; and thither to me came</l>
        <l>A pilgrim ; and he glanced into mine eyes</l>
        <l>With sight that read the sickness of my soul ,</l>
        <l>And sat beside me , and in measured words</l>
        <l>Like far-off song told me this parable :</l>
        <l>The Buddha came to where the sea</l>
        <l>Curled silver-white upon the land ,</l>
        <l>And murmurs of infinity</l>
        <l>Breathed on the sand .</l>
        <l>And there lay shells like rosy foam</l>
        <l>Borne from the caverns of the deep ,</l>
        <l>Frail playthings drifted from the home</l>
        <l>Of timeless , tideless sleep .</l>
        <l>And on the sand a Fisher stood ,</l>
        <l>Drying his nets that late had seen</l>
        <l>The silent caverns of the flood</l>
        <l>And all the wastes between .</l>
        <l>The Fisher lingered in his place</l>
        <l>With countenance of mild surprise ,</l>
        <l>And looked upon the Buddha 's face</l>
        <l>With dumb , uncomprehending eyes .</l>
        <l>And Buddha spake : “ Thy nets are drawn ,</l>
        <l>Thy boat rocks idle on the sea ,</l>
        <l>Thy day turns westward , and is gone ....</l>
        <l>Come thou with me . ”</l>
        <l>The Fisher marvelled : “ I must toil</l>
        <l>With nets and shells among the caves ,</l>
        <l>To win the sea 's unwilling spoil</l>
        <l>From the harsh waves . ”</l>
        <l>And Buddha answered : “ Cast no more</l>
        <l>Thy nets upon the troubled sea ,</l>
        <l>Nor gather shells along the shore .</l>
        <l>Come thou with me .</l>
        <l>“ Thou drawest shells and curious flowers</l>
        <l>From out the blue untrodden caves .</l>
        <l>Thou seest the passing of the hours .</l>
        <l>Thou hearest the clamor of the waves .</l>
        <l>“ Thou openest the shell where lies</l>
        <l>The pearl more white than driven spray —</l>
        <l>And trackless past thy vision flies</l>
        <l>Each passing day .</l>
        <l>“ But I will teach thee not to stir</l>
        <l>The shell nor flower in its sleep .</l>
        <l>For thou shalt roam the sepulchre</l>
        <l>That chasms all their native deep .</l>
        <l>“ And vain desire , like terror grown</l>
        <l>Deep in the chambers of thy breast ,</l>

        <l>Utterly moulded . Like your heart itself ,</l>

        <l>Give me the leave , and I will lead you there</l>
        <l>For one supreme and ultimate trial of choice</l>
        <l>That has no doubtful outcome . And my pledge</l>
        <l>Shall still be valid ! If this refuge gives</l>
        <l>Not all that you desire , you still may claim</l>
        <l>My service as your slave . Thus do you risk</l>
        <l>No atom , but have gain of one last chance</l>

        <l>Well , if this hope is vain</l>
        <l>To urge you , let despair serve in its stead</l>
        <l>As roweled spur . For see where now you stand :</l>
        <l>The mock of destiny — the man who lost</l>
        <l>All joys of the bright many that the world</l>
        <l>Cherishes ! Aye , and even lost his friend ,</l>
        <l>His one deep lasting friend — and stood thereafter</l>
        <l>Fixed like a donkey .... Though I led you on</l>
        <l>From paradise to paradise , and none</l>
        <l>Sufficed you — that were surely better sport —</l>
        <l>Testing and trying with sublime contempt —</l>
        <l>Than finger-twirling ! But not thus I lead .</l>
        <l>For now you shall , you shall have paradise !</l>

        <l>And ignorant of paradise .... Where lies it ?</l>

        <l>Rising above the palm-trees , with the look</l>

        <l>And that I cannot ever be your friend</l>
        <l>As Mr. Brander is . I know so little —</l>

       <lg>
        <l>You have looked</l>
        <l>Askance at me these many days , perplexed</l>
        <l>To reconcile the fountains of my will</l>
        <l>With my strange acts , and with the dark report</l>
        <l>That you have heard concerning me . Dear friend ,</l>
        <l>Be you not angry , now I say to you</l>
        <l>In full confession , that from day to day</l>
        <l>I have deceived you : I have hid my face</l>
        <l>Even from my friend : I have with doubtful mask</l>
        <l>In alien guises tempted you , to try</l>
        <l>Your metal . But the hour of trial is past ;</l>
        <l>The event is sure ; and now I ope my heart</l>
        <l>And show to you what few of living men</l>
        <l>Have guessed — my final secret .</l>

       <lg>
        <l>Listen , and be truth 's judge . I am not such</l>
        <l>As men esteem me ; and my spirit 's springs</l>
        <l>Rise not from buried and infernal realms ,</l>
        <l>But like your own , out of the fount of God</l>
        <l>They have their being . I , though lowliest far ,</l>
        <l>Yet am a servant of the House of God —</l>
        <l>Deputed to mine office by His hand ,</l>
        <l>And on His mission .</l>

       <speaker>SATAN</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>God is infinite ,</l>
        <l>Likewise His wisdom . His omniscience wills</l>
        <l>That I go forth among the haunts of men</l>
        <l>And offer evil to their touch . Thereby ,</l>
        <l>Some spurn me — and the force whereby they spurn</l>
        <l>Lifts them up nearer to His arms . Some take</l>
        <l>The sin I offer , fall from grace , go down —</l>
        <l>And lost in fathomless gulfs of wickedness ,</l>
        <l>Cry out with utter yearning to His love</l>
        <l>That it may save them , and repentant turn</l>
        <l>Their prodigal faces toward His doors again ,</l>
        <l>Never to wander more . But some few souls ,</l>
        <l>Who neither spurn temptation nor repent</l>
        <l>After their fall — these unregenerate</l>
        <l>It is mine office wholly to destroy</l>
        <l>And cleanse the universe for the praise of God .</l>
        <l>Thus does all evil serve His mighty throne ,</l>
        <l>And all return to Him .</l>

      <sp>

       <lg>
        <l>I would tell you all</l>
        <l>And show to you at last your destiny .</l>
        <l>The vanities of the world , the woes and sins ,</l>
        <l>Are but the acid by whose fiery touch</l>
        <l>I sort the gold from out the transient brass</l>
        <l>And purify and fine it that it be</l>
        <l>Worthy God 's altar . My belovèd friend ,</l>
        <l>Such was your trial ; thus have I tempted you</l>
        <l>With things averse to God , with forms and faiths</l>
        <l>Outcast and separate from Him . You have seen</l>
        <l>The whole world 's vanities ; you have come to know</l>
        <l>That in this world 's illusion is no power</l>
        <l>Whose love is refuge : even the living death</l>
        <l>Of cold Nirvana frights you . Thus at last ,</l>
        <l>Knowing that you are powerless , and the world</l>
        <l>Bare of salvation for your feebleness ,</l>
        <l>You stand on this great threshold ; and your eyes</l>
        <l>That see despair and loneliness shall raise</l>
        <l>Their sight to heaven ; and peace shall fold you round ;</l>
        <l>And God , who is our Father , shall be yours .</l>

        <l>This is not truth ! My fevered eyes are weak</l>
        <l>To look into this glowing maze of fire</l>
        <l>With vision . All the ramparts of the world</l>
        <l>Reel round me . I have scoffed God all my days ,</l>
        <l>Believing pain — your province of the world —</l>
        <l>Proof of His non-existence . And you come</l>
        <l>Crying His glory , testifying His faith ,</l>
        <l>Exhorting me to seek Him .... I am lost</l>
        <l>Where naught is known to me .</l>

So have all souls — The holy and the pure — from age to age , Learned , homesick for His home . Their frustrate hopes , Their burdens heavier than by mortal strength Can be sustained , their impotence , bow down Each spirit : and it cries : “ O God , support My helplessness ; unto Thy perfect will Do I resign my vain and evil hopes , My burdens ; and Thy Will Be Done Forever . ” Thus , with arms folded on despairing breast , With head bowed to the inscrutable decree , They seek Him : and a sudden glory fills The humbled bosom ; all His stars and thrones Shine down upon it ; all His majesty Enters that lowly door , lifts up , sustains The sundered soul ; and His beneficence With more than father-love enfolds the heart Joined to His own forever . From His light Reflected radiance pours ; to the dark sight Comes glimpse of the high justice of God 's will ; And all roads lead to Heaven , and all hearts lie Within His love , and all 's well with the world .<stage>Deep organ music begins to roll through the arches of the cathedral . Candles are lighted one by one on the High Altar . Worshippers begin to enter the nave : they pass down the long central aisle and gather in groups at the far end , near the Altar . Faust stands leaning against a pillar , silent and lost in meditation .</stage>Brander enters among the worshippers . He passes the spot where Faust is standing , glances at him and stops , astonished .</p>

        <l>Betraying lightly with a careless kiss</l>
        <l>A mortal body and immortal soul ;</l>
        <l>I saw no thing in all my days to claim</l>
        <l>A sane man 's approbation ; one by one</l>
        <l>Each glittering bauble that I late had loved</l>
        <l>Crumbled to dust beneath the parching fire</l>

        <l>Thank God for it ! That night I saw my joys</l>
        <l>Like some rank thicket of bright vanities</l>
        <l>Masking a precipice . A sense of sin</l>
        <l>And loathing overcame me , and the power</l>
        <l>Of utter terror filled me . I beheld</l>
        <l>The evil riot of gross earthy things</l>
        <l>That had o'ergrown me . Like a burden lay</l>
        <l>That sense upon me , and it pressed me down</l>
        <l>To a despondence deep beyond all words ,</l>
        <l>Beyond all thought . And no escape I saw</l>
        <l>Except the bullet ....</l>

        <l>Thus the doubtful days</l>
        <l>Passed like a nightmare . Till , one Sabbath morn ,</l>
        <l>As restlessly I paced , some random mood</l>
        <l>Led me to enter this cathedral 's doors</l>
        <l>At hour of service . As I knelt , with lips</l>
        <l>Unknown to prayer , the mighty music rolled</l>
        <l>Over my heart like an all-purging flood ,</l>
        <l>And a voice chanted : “ He that loveth life</l>
        <l>Shall lose it ; he that hateth this world 's life</l>
        <l>Shall keep the life eternal . ” And a voice</l>
        <l>Shortly thereafter sang , in angel tones :</l>
        <l>“ Come , let our feet return unto the Lord ;</l>
        <l>For He hath torn , and He will heal us . ” And</l>
        <l>My soul cried : “ Yield thy burdens to the Lord ,</l>
        <l>Upon His love cast thine unworthy self ,</l>
        <l>And bid His Will Be Done . ”</l>
        <l>And then my soul</l>
        <l>Melted as in the warmth of His embrace .</l>
        <l>My guilt was gone like night before the sun :</l>
        <l>Light blinded me ; an infinite love and joy</l>
        <l>Lifted me up , a child again , from earth</l>
        <l>Into such regions as my mortal speech</l>
        <l>Can never utter . And from that hour forth ,</l>
        <l>God has been with me .... Now you know my tale .</l>

        <l>About the Devil ; and if this Mr. Faust</l>
        <l>Has really made some new discovery</l>
        <l>About him , it seems well that even the young</l>

        <l>The real importance of his talk to-day .</l>
        <l>I 've been informed , on good authority ,</l>
        <l>That he will have the Devil on the platform</l>
        <l>And publicly enchain him to a cart</l>

        <l>Of strikes and lock-outs . Without any doubt ,</l>
        <l>If he goes trying to harness up the Devil ,</l>
        <l>It will precipitate a teamsters ’ strike .</l>

       <lg>
        <l>I have beheld the toil and pain of life ,</l>
        <l>Its emptiness and defeat ; I have beheld</l>
        <l>Hearts , weary with recurrence of the days</l>
        <l>That held no sweetness , turn in trust to where</l>
        <l>In high aërial spaces far from earth</l>
        <l>God in his heaven to all the weary ones</l>
        <l>Offers a refuge . And in such a mood</l>
        <l>Was I , too , led toward heaven by one whom now</l>
        <l>I know my foe — Satan . Toward God I turned ,</l>
        <l>Seeking in Him fulfilment of all hopes</l>
        <l>That earth had thwarted . Then , in the hour of prayer</l>
        <l>And revelation , from my deepest breast</l>
        <l>Flashed lightnings . And I saw the Lord of Hosts</l>
        <l>High on a mountain , inaccessible</l>
        <l>To yearning men , who , mastered by a dream ,</l>
        <l>Turn skyward from our dark and struggling earth .</l>
        <l>I saw the crafty Satan urging on</l>
        <l>The heavenward-yearning myriads , while the world</l>
        <l>Lay like a stagnant quagmire , to his sway</l>
        <l>Wholly abandoned , and man 's mortal house</l>
        <l>Burned in fierce conflagration of corruption .</l>
        <l>And lo ! the lightnings from my heart smote forth</l>
        <l>Across the heavens ; and God dissolved like cloud ,</l>
        <l>And through the cloud peered Satan 's sinister face .</l>
        <l>Friends : God is dead ; your God and mine is dead .</l>
        <l>And Satan in his place — Satan who is</l>
        <l>The father of the gods — lures on your hearts</l>
        <l>Unto an idol in the untrodden skies ,</l>
        <l>That , while ye dream oblivious in the void ,</l>
        <l>The earth may crumble . Or if God there be ,</l>
        <l>He is the God of dying hearts and spent —</l>
        <l>A deity of chaos , for whose ends</l>
        <l>One thing alone is mete — ruin of life ,</l>
        <l>Of loathings and of longings that on earth</l>
        <l>Restlessly grapple with the powers of Hell .</l>
        <l>I know not if in regions yet unguessed</l>
        <l>Some gods may dwell , of nature fit to guide</l>
        <l>Us , the adventurers of an earthly fight .</l>
        <l>But I have seen with eyes that cannot lie</l>
        <l>That they reside not in this Devil 's net —</l>

        <l>For slaves , not men . With bitter hand , destroy</l>
        <l>This idol of destruction ! Smite all haunts</l>
        <l>Of faith and resignation and defeat</l>
        <l>And rest and peace and comfort . Heaven and earth</l>
        <l>Alike are poisoned : somnolence in heaven ,</l>
        <l>Decay on earth is regnant . Every faith</l>
        <l>And law and nation must in wreck go down</l>
        <l>For us who see the death that taints their halls ;</l>
        <l>And ruin shall walk reckless through the world ,</l>
        <l>Destroying tombs where life is daily slain !</l>

       <speaker>BRANDER</speaker>
       <p><stage>rises suddenly from his place in the audience</stage>My friends , I came to listen , not to speak . But when such words as these from impious lips Fall lightly , I must rise here to refute Their poisonous message . Three days since , I stood With this man in the sacred halls of God , And witnessed in his heart the glory grow Of God 's bright hope . Then suddenly from Hell , Or from his own deep , labyrinthine heart , Sprang fiends to snatch him back from heaven 's clear gate And God 's deliverance . And his bitter lips , By thirst so nearly quenched made bitterer yet , Cried blasphemies against the powers of heaven And all bright starry hopes that light our days With faith and glory . And the hand of God , Inscrutably withheld , smote him not dumb , But suffered him to go . Now in our sight He rises to proclaim his searing doubt , His hot destroying passion , and tears down Our fairest altars . I , who was his friend , Hereby renounce him ; and in sober words Counsel all men to flee the company Of one who hates the great hopes of the world !</p>

        <l>The Devil who sought to lead you to resign</l>
        <l>Your will to his . Perhaps it was not well</l>

        <l>And your old wager is a laughing-stock ,</l>
        <l>So valueless your will , so vain your power</l>

        <l>Your utter nakedness . But I have brought</l>

        <l>The common joys , the peace of nescience ,</l>
        <l>The trust in some far Will , the hope to flame</l>
        <l>A beacon in the darkness of men 's dreams :</l>
        <l>Driven forth from these , one citadel still lifts</l>
        <l>Heaven-fronting : there I stand , delivered , free ,</l>
        <l>Master again — that citadel , my soul .</l>
        <l>I have escaped from all the bondages ;</l>
        <l>And now bow down to nothing . Joy or pain ,</l>
        <l>Defeat or conquest , good or evil , now</l>
        <l>Lure me no more . I will put hope in nothing</l>
        <l>Save in that whole strange glistening mortal life</l>
        <l>That past me streams unto an end sublime</l>
        <l>Whereof you know not . All our ends are folly ,</l>
        <l>And win not what they seek ; yet there is joy</l>
        <l>In seeking ; and one end there is that shows</l>
        <l>A brighter glow . I am the watcher set</l>
        <l>Upon the heights . In my impassioned sight</l>
        <l>All life is holy that strives unto life :</l>
        <l>Death only is damnation . I will be</l>
        <l>More happy than the happiest man , more strong</l>
        <l>Than is the strongest ! I will climb on the neck</l>
        <l>Of this great monster , Life , and guide its course —</l>
        <l>For I am master — toward that end I see</l>
        <l>Hidden afar off .</l>

        <l>Here to posterity I bequeath my soul —</l>
        <l>Worthless , perhaps , as heritage , but the all</l>
        <l>I have to give to them I love so much .</l>
        <l>These pages shall cry kinship to the few</l>

        <l>Satan recedes ; but thou who seemest near —</l>
        <l>O unborn man , whose soul is of my soul ,</l>
        <l>Whose glory is of my glory — all my love</l>
        <l>Floods out like light from the down-going sun</l>
        <l>Toward thee , the nursling of a lofty line .</l>
        <l>Thou art my faith — man the divine to come —</l>
        <l>Man whom I loathe for that which he is not —</l>
        <l>Man , even now half divine because of all</l>
        <l>That shall spring from him in the days to be .</l>
        <l>Thou , too , shalt fight with Satan , as I fought ,</l>
        <l>Yea , in eternal battles till the end .</l>
        <l>Thou shalt go with him past the lure of lust ,</l>
        <l>The lure of power , the lure of that great sleep</l>
        <l>Nirvana ; past the yet more luring sleep</l>
        <l>Where dreams assuage the soul to be a dream .</l>
        <l>Thou shalt go with him , yet apart from him</l>
        <l>And all his works . He has no part in thee .</l>
        <l>He is the chaos seething at earth 's core —</l>
        <l>Remnant of times when out of chaos sprang</l>
        <l>Life 's upward impulse . He is the darkness spread</l>
        <l>Ere yet was light — the matter ere was form —</l>
        <l>The vast inertia that on motion 's heels</l>
        <l>Clings viper-like . Of life and form and growth</l>
        <l>He is negator ; and his ceaseless joy</l>
        <l>Is to impede and drag to chaos back</l>
        <l>The shoot that toward the light triumphant springs .</l>
        <l>But vain his victories , though he lingers yet</l>
        <l>With slowly narrowing frontiers . Past his will ,</l>
        <l>Slowly the sons of light transcend , remould</l>
        <l>Their day and destiny ; slowly there is born</l>
        <l>Order from chaos , flowers from formless mud ,</l>
        <l>Light from the darkness , Faust 's from Satan 's soul .</l>
        <l>With laughing and with wonder and with triumph</l>
        <l>I take that life and clasp it to my breast —</l>
        <l>I , part of all , and all a part of me —</l>
        <l>Streaming a river flashing in the sun .</l>
        <l>I am drunk with the glory of that which tramps me down</l>
        <l>And passes and transcends me — and is mine !</l>

        <l>Thy harvest — when the passion of the years</l>
        <l>Turns earthward , and in mastered order sets</l>
        <l>The house that is our dwelling . And therein ,</l>
        <l>In the gold light of summer afternoons ,</l>
        <l>With thee I too , careless and laughing , play</l>
        <l>Mid dreams and wonders that our will has made —</l>
        <l>Bathe in the beauty that our eyes have poured</l>
        <l>Upon the hills — and drink in thirsty draughts</l>
        <l>The happiness we have rained upon the earth .</l>
        <l>I see , with ultimate unshaken vision !</l>

        <l>Our children 's children rise ; and all my love</l>
        <l>Draws toward them and the light upon their brows .</l>

        <l>When here I stood that memorable night ,</l>

        <l>Pierces it . And this broken frame of mine</l>
        <l>Cannot annul that much of victory —</l>
        <l>The solace born of passion to destroy</l>
        <l>That shall survive me if indeed I die .</l>
        <l>Alone my life was lived ; if now I go ,</l>
        <l>It is alone into a quiet grave</l>
        <l>Above whose mound the fairer future days</l>
        <l>Shall pass , and I not know them . Yet my night</l>
        <l>Takes foregleam from the vision of that dawn</l>
        <l>And I am solaced . And I leave my solace</l>
        <l>As heritage to the ever widening few</l>

For in my halls Lights kindle , and the music sobs and sings In ecstasy of other guests than thee ....<stage>He takes up his pen and turns to the end of the manuscript , as if to write</stage>Can this poor strength suffice me to complete These final words ? Nay , better to leave unsaid The few last lines my vanity desires To tell and justify my end and fall Like flourish of bright trumpets . Let them sleep Unuttered ; for the burden of my song Is voiced already in these labored leaves ; And it is well , unfinished and unclosed Should stop this record , whose concluding words Of fairer hope , of sheerer miracle , Some greater hand than mine shall some day write And seal the chronicle — nay , never seal it !</p>

        <l>My lips are sealed ,</l>
        <l>Though I would fain prepare you for that first</l>
        <l>And awful moment when , beyond death 's gates ,</l>
        <l>You see and know — for now you do not know —</l>
        <l>What there awaits you . You have seen the grave ;</l>
        <l>You know the dissolution and decay</l>
        <l>That folds the body as it mouldering lies</l>
        <l>After the racking of those final hours</l>
        <l>Where soul and body part . But have you guessed</l>
        <l>That — as the body rots without the soul —</l>
        <l>So the soul crumbles in a vile decay</l>
        <l>You cannot picture , when the body dies ?</l>
        <l>Then falls the spirit limb from reeking limb .</l>
        <l>An agony beyond all mortal thought</l>
        <l>Shakes every atom of the spiritual frame —</l>
        <l>The throes of dissolution . Death , indeed ,</l>
        <l>All men can bear ; but this last spiritual death ,</l>
        <l>This torture of the disembodied soul</l>
        <l>To force dissolving — ah , prepare yourself !</l>
        <l>It shall appall you !</l>

        <l>And those to whom I give shall after death</l>
        <l>Slumber unconscious while the awful change</l>
        <l>Attacks them ; and oblivion shall be theirs</l>

        <l>Its curtains round my body . You have sought</l>

        <l>Moves onward in its self-ordainèd sway —</l>
        <l>Life everlasting . Through my veins it sweeps ,</l>
        <l>Bearing me onward ; and as I am borne ,</l>
        <l>I onward urge , till my short day be done</l>
        <l>And I fall spent ; and over me the wave</l>
        <l>Sweeps on its way immortal ; and my soul</l>

        <l>Ah , what a ghastly dream !</l>

        <l>Nay , what have I to do with yearning thoughts</l>
        <l>Of immortality ? I am young with life !</l>
        <l>I shall not die ! Hope and the eager years</l>
        <l>Of labor rise before me as I press</l>
        <l>Clear of these shadows . I have dreamed dark dreams —</l>
        <l>One very dark of late — but now my blood</l>
        <l>Resurges in a not less passionate fire</l>
        <l>Than when , less wise , I stretched my hands to life ,</l>
        <l>And all my hopes were winged . But that is past ;</l>
        <l>And dreams are past : the day of deed is come .</l>
        <l>Aye , in the cities , on the hills of the world ,</l>
        <l>I shall uplift the banner of high wars —</l>
        <l>I shall make mock of this strange dizziness —</l>
