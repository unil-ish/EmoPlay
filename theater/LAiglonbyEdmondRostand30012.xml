    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>At Baden , near Vienna , in 1830 .</stage>
     <stage>The drawing-room of the villa occupied by MARIA LOUISA . The walls are painted al fresco in bright colors . The frieze is decorated with a design of sphinxes .</stage>
     <stage>At the back , between two other windows , a window reaching to the ground and forming the entrance from the garden . Beyond , the balustrade of the terrace leading into the garden ; a glimpse of lindens and pine-trees . A magnificent day in the beginning of September . Empire furniture of lemonwood decorated with bronze . A large china stove in the centre of the wall on the left . In front of it a door . On the right , two doors . The first leads to the apartments of MARIA LOUISA . In front of the window on the left at the back an Erard piano of the period , and a harp . A big table on the right , and against the right wall a small table with shelves filled with books . On the left , facing the audience , a Récamier couch , and a large stand for candlesticks . A great many flowers in vases . Framed engravings on the walls representing the members of the Imperial Family of Austria . A portrait of the Emperor Francis .</stage>
     <stage>At the rise of the curtain a group of elegant ladies is discovered at the further end of the room . Two of them are seated at the piano , with their backs to the audience , playing a duet . Another is at the harp . They are playing at sight , amid much laughter and many interruptions . A lackey ushers in a modestly dressed young girl who is accompanied by an officer of the Austrian Cavalry . Seeing that no one notices their entrance , these two remain standing a moment in a corner . The COUNT DE BOMBELLES comes in from the door on the right and goes toward the piano . He sees the young girl , and stops , with a smile .</stage>

    <sp>
     <speaker>THERESA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Why , it would mean</l>
      <l>I 'd never thought or read , and was not French ,</l>
      <l>Nor born in recent years , if I could stand</l>
      <l>Unmoved so near them . Is she lovely ?</l>

    <sp>
     <speaker>THERESA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>She 's sad</l>
      <l>And that itself is beauty .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BOMBELLES</speaker>
     <p>But I 'm puzzled . Surely you 've seen her ?</p>

     <speaker>THERESA</speaker>
     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TIBURTIUS</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>We feared we might disturb these ladies</l>
      <l>Whose laughter sings new gamuts to the piano .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THERESA</speaker>
     <p>Here in my corner I await her notice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BOMBELLES</speaker>
     <p>What ? Why , it 's she who 's playing bass this moment !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>TIBURTIUS</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>The Austrian uniform is to my taste ;</l>

     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIA LOUISA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>To THERESA .</stage>
      <l>So that 's the rascal whose extravagance</l>
      <l>Eats up your little fortune ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THERESA</speaker>
     <p>Oh !— my brother —</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIA LOUISA</speaker>
     <p>The wretch has ruined you , but you forgive him !

     <speaker>THERESA</speaker>
     <p>I am grieved beyond the power of words .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIA LOUISA</speaker>
     <p>Yes , to be sure . It was a grievous loss . That lovely soul was little known !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THERESA</speaker>
     <p>Oh , surely !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIA LOUISA</speaker>

     <speaker>MARIA LOUISA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>One cannot know at first all one has lost ;</l>

      <l>The newness off artistically . Worn</l>
      <l>With salt and pepper trousers , what a picture !</l>
      <l>We 'll throw aside this heavy yellow stuff —</l>
      <l>Can Hamlet wear the clumsy clouts of Falstaff ?—</l>
      <l>We 'll pass to mantles , Prince . A splendid plaid ,</l>
      <l>Demi-collar with simili-sleeves behind .</l>
      <l>Eccentric ? Granted .— This , called the Roulière :</l>
      <l>Sober , a large , Hidalgo-like effect ;</l>
      <l>The very thing to woo a Doña Sol in .</l>
      <l>Excellent workmanship ; a silver chain ; the collar</l>
      <l>Of finest sable ; made in our own workshops ;</l>
      <l>Simple , but what a cut ! The cut is everything .</l>

      <l>And all that seems to you mere vulgar chatter ,</l>

     <speaker>THE TAILOR</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I ? A nameless atom .</l>
      <l>Weary of life in mean and paltry times ,</l>
      <l>Of smoking pipes and dreaming of ideals .</l>
      <l>Who am I ? How do I know ? That 's my trouble .</l>
      <l>Am I at all ?— It 's very hard to “ be . ”</l>
      <l>I study Victor Hugo ; spout his odes —</l>
      <l>I tell you this , because this sort of thing</l>
      <l>Is all contemporary youth . I spend</l>
      <l>Extravagant fortunes in acquiring boredom .</l>
      <l>I am an artist , Highness , and Young France .</l>
      <l>Also I 'm carbonaro at your service .</l>
      <l>And as I 'm always bored I wear red waistcoats ,</l>
      <l>And that amuses me . At tying neck-cloths</l>
      <l>I once was very good indeed . That 's why</l>
      <l>They sent me here to-day to play the tailor .</l>
      <l>I 'll add , to make the picture quite complete ,</l>
      <l>That I 'm a liberal and a king-devourer .</l>
      <l>My life and dagger are at your command .</l>

     <lg>
      <l>Every day a book .</l>
      <l>Locked safe all night I read it . I was drunk !</l>
      <l>When it was finished , to conceal my crime ,</l>
      <l>I tossed it on the tester 's canopy ,</l>
      <l>And there the heap grew , hidden in the darkness ;</l>
      <l>I slept beneath a dome of history .</l>
      <l>All day the heap lay quiet , but at night ,</l>
      <l>When I was sleeping , it began to stir ,</l>
      <l>And from the pages clamorous with battles .</l>
      <l>The battles issued , stretching torpid wings ;</l>
      <l>And laurels showered upon my slumbering eyes .</l>
      <l>Austerlitz gleamed among my curtains , Jena</l>
      <l>Glowed in the gilded tassels holding them</l>
      <l>And on a sudden lapsed into my dream .</l>
      <l>Till once , when Metternich was gravely telling</l>
      <l>His version of my father 's history ,</l>
      <l>Down comes my canopy crushed by the glory ;</l>
      <l>A hundred volumes with their fluttering pages</l>
      <l>Shouting one name !</l>

     <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Yes ; but it 's French and blinded by its hate .</l>
      <l>It says they 're poisoning me ; hints at Locusta</l>
      <l>Who poisoned Claudius . If thy Prince is dying ,</l>
      <l>Wherefore , O France , belittle his disease ?</l>
      <l>It is no poisoned cup of melodrama</l>

      <l>Clashes and thunders , ceaselessly reproaches</l>
      <l>Against my languor with its bells and guns !</l>
      <l>Silence your tocsins and your salvos ! Poison ?</l>
      <l>What need of poison in the prison-house ?</l>
      <l>I yearn to broaden history !— I am</l>
      <l>A pallid visage watching at a window .</l>
      <l>If I could only rid myself of doubt !</l>
      <l>You know me well ! what do you think of me ?</l>
      <l>Suppose I were what people say we are</l>
      <l>And what we often are , we great men 's sons !</l>
      <l>Metternich feeds this doubt with frequent hints :</l>
      <l>He 's right ; it is his duty as an Austrian .</l>
      <l>I shiver when he opes the bonbonnière</l>
      <l>They call his wit , to find some honeyed venom .</l>
      <l>You ! tell me honestly what is my worth ?</l>
      <l>You know me ; can I be an Emperor ?</l>

     <p>We perfectly agree in our conclusions .</p>

     <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>

     <lg>
      <l>You , traitor of Essonnes ,</l>
      <l>The mob has found new uses for your name</l>

     <speaker>MARMONT</speaker>
     <lg>

     <p>Sir !</p>

      <l>These fifteen years . I do so still ; ‘ tis true .</l>
      <l>Can you not guess I seek to excuse myself ?</l>
      <l>I never saw your Father after Elba —</l>
      <l>If I had seen him I should have returned .</l>
      <l>Others betrayed him , thinking to save France ;</l>
      <l>But these beheld his face again , and fell</l>
      <l>Under the spell , as I have fallen to-night .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>

     <p>How ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARMONT</speaker>

      <l>In that frown , and in that haughty gesture ;</l>
      <l>The sparkling eye ! Insult me . I remain .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Almost you have atoned if that be true ,</l>
      <l>Saved me from self-distrust which these exploit .</l>
      <l>What ? With my gloomy brow and narrow chest —?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARMONT</speaker>
     <p>I have beheld him !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MARMONT</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>We were weary .</l>
      <l>Can you not understand ? No peace in Europe .</l>
      <l>It 's well to conquer , but one wants to live !</l>
      <l>Berlin , Vienna , never , never Paris !</l>
      <l>Beginning and beginning and beginning ,</l>
      <l>Again , and yet again as in a nightmare ;</l>

      <l>Too simple and too ignorant to covet</l>
      <l>The famous marshal 's baton in our knapsacks ?</l>
      <l>What about us , who marched through every weather ,</l>
      <l>Sweating but fearless , shivering without trembling ,</l>
      <l>Kept on our feel by trumpet-calls , by fever ,</l>
      <l>And by the songs we sang through conquered countries ?</l>
      <l>Us upon whom for seventeen years — just think !—</l>
      <l>The knapsack , sabre , turn-screw , flint , and gun ,</l>
      <l>Beside the burden of an empty belly ,</l>
      <l>Made the sweet weight of five and fifty pounds ?</l>
      <l>Us , who wore bearskins in the burning tropics</l>
      <l>And marched bareheaded through the snows of Russia ,</l>
      <l>Who trotted casually from Spain to Austria ?</l>
      <l>Us who , to free our travel-weary legs ,</l>
      <l>Like carrots from the slough of miry roads ,</l>
      <l>Often with both hands had to lug them out ?</l>
      <l>Us , who , not having jujubes for our coughs ,</l>
      <l>Took day-long foot-baths in the freezing Danube ?</l>
      <l>Who just had leisure when some officer</l>
      <l>Came riding up , and gayly cried “ To arms !</l>
      <l>The enemy is on us ! Drive him back ! ”</l>
      <l>To eat a slice of rook — and raw at that ,</l>
      <l>Or quickly mix a delicate ice-cream</l>
      <l>With melted snow and a dead horse 's blood ?</l>
      <l>Us , who —</l>

      <l>You are the titles and you catch the eye ;</l>

      <l>That goes to make a page of history .</l>
      <l>Oh , my brave Flambeau , painter of my soldiers ,</l>
      <l>To think while you were near me all this month ,</l>
      <l>I only looked upon you as a spy .</l>

     <p>Oh , our acquaintance dates much further back !</p>

     <speaker>FLAMBEAU</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>One Thursday in the garden of Saint Cloud</l>
      <l>Marshal Duroc stood with a maid-in-waiting ,</l>
      <l>Watching your Highness at his nurse 's breast —</l>
      <l>Its whiteness , I remember , startled me .</l>
      <l>Marshal Duroc exclaimed , “ Come here ! ” I came .</l>
      <l>But there were lots of things to make me nervous :</l>
      <l>The Imperial child , the gorgeous rosy sleeves</l>
      <l>The Maid of honor wore , Duroc , the breast —</l>
      <l>In short , the tuft was shivering on my bearskin ;</l>
      <l>So much so that your Highness noticed it .</l>
      <l>You gazed upon it pensively : what was it ?</l>
      <l>And while you hailed it with a milky laugh</l>
      <l>You seemed uncertain which to admire the more</l>
      <l>About this moving scarlet miracle :</l>
      <l>Its motion , or the fact that it was scarlet .</l>
      <l>Suddenly , while I stooped , your little hands</l>
      <l>Began lo pull the precious tuft about .</l>
      <l>Seeing my plight , the Marshal cried severely ,</l>
      <l>“ Do n't interfere ” — I did n't interfere ;</l>
      <l>But having sunk upon my knees I heard</l>
      <l>The nurse , the marshal , and the lady laughing .</l>
      <l>And when I rose the grass was strewn with red :</l>
      <l>As for my tuft , that was a beardless wire .</l>
      <l>“ I 'll sign an order , ” said Duroc , “ for two . ”</l>
      <l>Back to my quarters then I strutted radiant ;</l>
      <l>“ You there ! hulloa ! ” exclaimed the Adjutant ,</l>
      <l>“ Who 's plucked you ? ” And I cried : “ The King of Rome ! ”</l>
      <l>And that is how one Thursday morn I met</l>
      <l>Your Majesty . Your Highness has developed .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
     <p>No , not developed : that is why I grieve . My “ Majesty ” has shrivelled to my “ Highness . ”</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MARMONT</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>To FLAMBEAU .</stage>
      <l>But since the Empire fell , what have you done ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FLAMBEAU</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I think I 've acted like a decent beggar .</l>
      <l>I know Fournier and Solignac . In May</l>
      <l>Eighteen-sixteen Didier and Sarlovèze</l>
      <l>Conspire and fail . I see the child Miard</l>
      <l>Perish , and David the old man , and weep ;</l>
      <l>They 'd have beheaded me , but I am missing .</l>
      <l>Good . I come back to Paris with an alias ;</l>
      <l>I smash a footstool on a royal guard</l>
      <l>Because he 'd trodden on my favorite corn .</l>
      <l>I take the chair at noisy drinking bouts ,</l>
      <l>Spend thirty pence a month . I nurse a hope</l>
      <l>That in the Var that Other still may land .</l>
      <l>I swagger in a Bonapartist hat</l>
      <l>And call whoever stares at me a vampire .</l>
      <l>I fight some thirty duels . I conspire</l>
      <l>At Béziers ; fail . They 'd have beheaded me ,</l>
      <l>But I am missing . Good . I join at once</l>
      <l>The plot at Lyons . All are seized . I fly .</l>
      <l>They 'd have beheaded me , but I am missing .</l>
      <l>So I come back to Paris , where , by chance ,</l>
      <l>I find myself mixed up in the Bazaar plot .</l>
      <l>Lefèvre-Desnouettes is in America .</l>
      <l>I join him there . “ What 's up , my General ? ”</l>
      <l>Says I . Says he , “ Come back . ” We start ; we 're wrecked .</l>
      <l>My General 's drowned , but I know how to swim ;</l>
      <l>And so I swim , bewailing Desnouettes .</l>
      <l>Good . Very good . Sun — azure waves — and sea-mews .</l>
      <l>A ship . They fish me up . I land in time</l>
      <l>To be among the plotters of Saumur .</l>
      <l>We fail again . They 'd have beheaded me ,</l>
      <l>But I am missing . So I make for Greece ,</l>
      <l>To rub the rust off , thrashing dirty Turks .</l>
      <l>One morning in July I 'm back in France .</l>
      <l>I see them heaping paving stones . I help .</l>
      <l>I fight . At night the tricolor is hoisted .</l>
      <l>Instead of the while banner of the King ,</l>
      <l>But as I think there still is something lacking</l>
      <l>To crown the point of that disloyal staff ;</l>
      <l>You know — the golden thing that beats its wings .</l>
      <l>I leave , to plot in the Romagna . Fail .</l>
      <l>A relative of yours —</l>

      <l>Next there 's a post of danger vacant here ;</l>
      <l>They give me forged credentials ; here I am .</l>
      <l>I 'm here ; but every day I see the Countess ,</l>
      <l>For I have found the cave your Highness dug</l>
      <l>With your preceptor Colin in the garden</l>
      <l>To play at little Robinson . All right !</l>
      <l>I hide in it . I find it has two openings :</l>
      <l>This in an ant-heap ; that , a bed of nettles .</l>
      <l>I wait . Your cousin brings her sketch-book , and</l>
      <l>There in the shadow of the Roman thingummies ,</l>
      <l>She on her camp-stool , I amid the mud ,</l>
      <l>She looking like an English tourist sketching ,</l>
      <l>I whispering from my cavern like a prompter ,</l>

     <speaker>MARMONT</speaker>
     <p>Clumsy thing to say !</p>

     <p>Well , in a French Prince that 's but half a fault .</p>

      <l>They try to imitate us here ; but , Lord !</l>
      <l>They 've got a curious kind of Louis-Quinze !</l>
      <l>I 'm not an expert , but I 've got an eye .</l>
      <stage>He lifts up a chair .</stage>
      <l>Just look how finnicking this wood-work is .</l>
      <stage>He puts it down and looks at it .</stage>
      <l>But then the tapestry ! What taste ! what mystery !</l>
      <l>It sings . It laughs . It crushes all the room .</l>
      <l>Why ? Do n't you know ? Why , these are Gobelins !</l>
      <l>How plain it is that cunning craftsmen made them .</l>
      <l>This taste , this elegance swears with the rest —</l>
      <l>And you my Lord , were also made in France !</l>

      <l>My Lord , it must be seen upon a breast .</l>

      <l>Which fell , and falling turned to burnished gold</l>
      <l>And to enamel with an edge of green ;</l>
      <l>‘ Twas like a jewel pouring from a wound .</l>

     <p>One had to do far greater deeds to win it .</p>

      <l>That Duke of Reichstadt who with helpless grief</l>
      <l>Can only wander under Austrian trees ,</l>
      <l>Carving an N upon their mossy trunks ,</l>
      <l>Wayfarer , only noticed when I cough ;</l>
      <l>Who have no longer even the little piece</l>
      <l>Of watered silk so scarlet in my cradle ;</l>
      <l>I , on whose woes they vainly lavish stars ,</l>
      <l>Who only wear two crosses , not the One !</l>
      <l>I , exiled , prisoner , sick , who may not ride</l>
      <l>Along the front of pompous regiments</l>
      <l>Scattering stars among my heroes ; yet</l>
      <l>I hope — I think — the son of such a father —</l>
      <l>Into whose hands a firmament was given —</l>
      <l>I think , in spite of shadows and dead days ,</l>
      <l>A little of the star clings to my fingers :—</l>
      <l>John Seraph Peter Flambeau , I adorn you !</l>

     <speaker>FLAMBEAU</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Yes ;</l>

     <speaker>MARMONT</speaker>
     <p>Very imprudent .</p>

     <speaker>FLAMBEAU</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>True , but then my failing</l>

     <p>What , weeping ? Take this handkerchief And dry your eyes upon the King of Rome !<stage>He kneels by the DUKE 'S side and wipes his eyes with the handkerchief .</stage>I bid you strike the iron while it 's hot : You 've got the people and you 've got the Marshals , The King , the King himself , is only King On one condition : that he 's Bonapartist . Vainly the Gallic cockerel spreads his wings That , from a distance , he may seem an eagle . We Frenchmen cannot breathe inglorious air ; The crown must slip from off a pear-shaped head . The youth of France will rally to your side Merrily shouting songs of Béranger — The street has shuddered and the pavement trembled , And Schönbrunn 's not so pretty as Versailles !</p>

You 'll never hear of it . ‘ Tis for myself . A private luxury . I must be mad to do a thing like this For no one 's eye , but just to say “ By Jove , That 's rather good ! ” At Schönbrunn !

      <l>No , from thy little sable pyramid</l>
      <l>Twelve years of splendor gaze on me in vain ,</l>

      <l>The leathern tag</l>
      <l>With which he constantly could take thee off ,</l>
      <l>And so win cheers yet leave thy shape unharmed .</l>
      <l>With thee he fanned himself after each victory ;</l>
      <l>Thou couldst not fall from his unheeding fingers ,</l>

      <l>To-day , my friend , thou art a reach-me-down ,</l>

     <p>The famous little hat — how very ugly ! They called it little — is it really little ? No ; it is big ; enormous ; it 's the hat A little man puts on to increase his inches . For ‘ twas a hatter set the legend going : The real Napoleon , after all , was Poupart . Ah , never think my hatred of thee slumbers ! ‘ Twas for thy shape 's sake first I hated thee , Thou vampire-bat of bloody battle-fields , Hat that seemed fashioned out of raven 's wings . I hated thee for pitilessly soaring Above the fields which witnessed our defeats , Half-circle , seeming on the ruddy sky The orb half-risen of some sable sun ! And for thy crown wherein the devil lurks , Thou juggler 's hat , laid with a sudden hand Upon a throne , an army , or a nation — When thou wert lifted all had disappeared . I hated thee for the salutes I gave thee , For thy simplicity — mere affectation — Thy insolent joy , thou piece of common beaver Amid the glittering diadems of gold ; For staying firmly on his haughty head When I sought flattering epithets to please thee . Conqueror , new , acclaimed , I hated thee ! I hate thee now , old , conquered and betrayed ! I hate thee for thy haughty shadow , cast Forever on the wall of history ; I hate thee for thy Jacobin cockade , Staring upon me like a bloodshot eye ; For all the murmurs sounding in thy shell , That huge black shell the waves have left behind Wherein the shuddering listener may hear The rumor of a nation on the march . I hate thee for the pride of France , whose bounds Thou hast enlarged until she scorns the world ; For Béranger I hate thee , and Raffet , For all the songs and all the pasquinades , And for the halo of Saint Helena . I hate thee , hate thee . I shall not be happy Until thy clumsy triangle of cloth , Despoiled of its traditions , is again What it should ne'er have ceased to be in France — The headgear of a village constable . I hate — but suddenly — how strange !— the present Sometimes with impish glee will ape the past !— Seeing thy well-known shape before me thus Carries my mind back to a distant day , For it was here he always put thee down When twenty years ago he sojourned here . This room was then the ante-chamber ; here , Waiting till graciously he showed himself , Dukes , Princes , Magyars , huddling in a corner , Fixed from afar their humbled eyes upon thee , Like lions , dreading with a helpless fury The tamer 's hat forgotten in the cage . ‘ Twas thus he placed thee , and here lay , as now , Weapons and papers . One might say ‘ twas he Had tossed thee carelessly upon the map , That this were still his home , this Bonaparte ! And that by turning , on the threshold — there — I should behold the Grenadier on —<stage>He starts on seeing FLAMBEAU standing rigid before the DUKE 'S door ; he rubs his eyes .</stage>Ha ! No ! no ! I 'm feverish ; my tête-à-tête With the old hat plays havoc with my nerves !<stage>He looks and draws near . FLAMBEAU does not move .</stage>Or have the moonbeams conjured up a spectre ? What is it , then ? Let 's see — let 's see — let 's see !<stage>He strides furiously toward FLAMBEAU .</stage>Who are you , fellow ?</p>

      <l>Dear friend , I 'm prouder of this little ball ,</l>
      <l>Of having mingled all these courtly perfumes</l>
      <l>With the wild odors of the midnight woods ,</l>
      <l>Than ever of the Congress of Verona .</l>
      <l>That is the vestiary and the way out</l>
      <l>So that in leaving you may find at once</l>
      <l>Your Polish mantle or your overcoat .</l>
      <l>Lastly , the theatre which I 've contrived</l>
      <l>On yonder bowling-green , near Cupid 's fountain ,</l>
      <l>Where , in a set-piece made of natural foliage ,</l>
      <l>Some princely amateurs will play “ Michel</l>
      <l>And ” — I do n't know — some dainty little piece</l>
      <l>By a French author : Eugène — what'shYpppHeNhishYpppHeNname ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>

      <l>Which ancestor will godfather my madness ?</l>
      <l>The living-dead , the alchemist , or bigot ?</l>
      <l>You see , they took their madness rather sadly ,</l>
      <l>But mingled perfumes make a novel scent ;</l>
      <l>My brain , mixed of these gloomy brains , may start</l>
      <l>Some pretty little madness of its own .</l>
      <l>Come ! What shall my peculiar madness be ?</l>
      <l>By heavens ! My instincts , conquered till to-day ,</l>
      <l>Make it quite simple : I 'll be mad with love !</l>

      <l>Snarer of hearts , astrologer of eyes ;</l>

     <speaker>THE DUKE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Why , if you think of it , dear friend ,</l>
      <l>Napoleon 's son , Don Juan , is strict logic .</l>
      <l>The soul 's the same : ever dissatisfied ;</l>
      <l>The same unceasing lust of victory .</l>
      <l>Oh splendid blood another has corrupted ,</l>
      <l>Who , striving to be Cæsar , was not able ;</l>
      <l>Thy energy is not all dead within me .</l>
      <l>A misbegotten Cæsar is Don Juan !</l>
      <l>Yes , ‘ tis another way of conquering ;</l>
      <l>Thus I shall know that fever of the heart</l>
      <l>Which Byron tells us kills whom it devours ;</l>
      <l>And ‘ tis a way of being still my father .</l>
      <l>Napoleon or Don Juan !— They 're decision ,</l>
      <l>The magic will , and the seductive grace .</l>
      <l>When to retake a great unfaithful land ,</l>
      <l>Calm and alone , sure of himself and her ,</l>
      <l>The adventurer landed in the Gulf of Juan ,</l>
      <l>He felt Don Juan 's thrill ; and when Don Juan</l>
      <l>Pricked a new conquest in his list of loves ,</l>
      <l>Did he not feel the pride of Bonaparte ?</l>
      <l>And , after all , who knows whether ‘ tis greater</l>
      <l>To conquer worlds , or be a moment loved ?</l>
      <l>So be it ? ‘ Tis well the legend closes thus ,</l>
      <l>And that this conqueror is the other 's son .</l>
      <l>I 'm the fair shadow of the dusky hero ,</l>
      <l>And , as he conquered nations , one by one ,</l>
      <l>So will I conquer women , one by one .</l>
      <l>Moonbeams shall be my sun of Austerlitz !</l>

      <l>What will you do with these ? ” — I 'll charm the ladies !</l>
      <l>It 's fine , among the people in the Prater ,</l>
      <l>To ride a horse that cost three thousand florins ,</l>
      <l>Which one can christen Jena . Austerlitz</l>

      <l>But when they beat the charge like little rabbits —</l>
      <l>Eleven drums with two-and-twenty sticks —</l>
      <l>They set our bayonets thrilling with their thunder ;</l>
      <l>The quivering zigzags seemed to cry aloud ,</l>

      <l>A brazen devil hiccoughed fire and steel</l>
      <l>And took them in the flank ; yes ! all the eleven !</l>
      <l>But , by the Lord ! you should have seen the woman !</l>

      <l>I understand . I am the expiation .</l>
      <l>All was not paid , and I complete the price .</l>
      <l>‘ Twas fated I should seek his battle-field ,</l>
      <l>And here , above the multitudinous dead ,</l>
      <l>Be the white victim , growing daily whiter ,</l>
      <l>Renouncing , praying , asking but to suffer ,</l>
      <l>Yearning toward heaven , like sacrificial incense !</l>
      <l>And while betwixt the heavens and this field</l>

      <l>He must become the high and holy signal</l>
      <l>That scares the ravens and calls back the eagles .</l>
      <l>There must be no more meanings in the field ,</l>
      <l>Nor dreadful writhings in the underwood .</l>
