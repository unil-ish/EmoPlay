   <div type="introduction">
    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">The première of “ LILIOM ” at Budapest in December , 1909 , left both playgoer and critic a bit bewildered . It was not the sort of play the Hungarian capital had been accustomed to expect of its favorite dramatist , whose THE DEVIL , after two years of unprecedented success , was still crowding the theatres of two continents .</p>
    <p n="2">One must , it was true , count on a touch of fantasy in every Molnar work . Never had he been wholly content with everyday reality , not in his stories , or in his sketches or in his earlier plays ; and least of all in THE DEVIL wherein the natural and supernatural were most whimsically blended . But in LILIOM , it seemed , he had carried fantasy to quite unintelligible lengths . Budapest was frankly puzzled .</p>
    <p n="3">What did he mean by killing his hero in the fifth scene , taking him into Heaven in the sixth and bringing him back to earth in the seventh ? Was this prosaic Heaven of his seriously or satirically intended ? Was Liliom a saint or a common tough ? And was his abortive redemption a symbol or merely a jibe ? These were some of the questions Budapest debated while the play languished through thirty or forty performances and was withdrawn .</p>
    <p n="4">Almost ten years passed before it was revived . This time it was an immediate and overwhelming triumph . Perhaps the wide circulation of the play in printed form had made its beauty and significance clearer . Perhaps the tragedy of the war had made Molnar 's public more sensitive to spiritual values . Whatever the reason , Budapest now accepted ecstatically what it had previously rejected , and Molnar was more of a popular hero than ever . From which it may be gleaned that Hungary takes its drama and dramatists more seriously , disapproves them more passionately and praises them more affectionately than we Americans can conceive . In Paris I once saw an audience rise en masse , because the sculptor Rodin had entered the auditorium , and remain on its feet cheering until he had taken his seat . Something of the kind greets Molnar whenever he appears in public , and nothing is more certain than that he is the hero , the oracle , the spoiled darling of club , salon and coffee house in which artistic Hungary foregathers .</p>
    <p n="5">But the years immediately following the first production of LILIOM were for him a period of eclipse . It was the first time that even the threat of failure had cast its shadow across his career . He became timid , wary of failure , too anxious to please his public . His subsequent plays were less original , less daring , more faithful to routine . Never again did he touch the heights of LILIOM ; and some of his best friends aver that he never will again until he has banished the dread of failure that obsesses him .</p>
    <p n="6">An odd situation , truly , and in some aspects a tragic one . Genius lacking the courage to spread its wings and soar . A potential immortal bidding fearfully for the praise of a coffee-house clique . Is it vanity ? Is it abnormal sensitiveness ? Biographical data cast little light on the enigma .</p>
    <p n="7">Franz Molnar was born in Budapest on January 12 , 1878 , the son of a wealthy Jewish merchant . He graduated from the Universities of Geneva and Budapest . His literary career was begun as a journalist at the age of eighteen . He wrote short sketches and humorous dialogues of such beauty and charm that he became a national figure almost at once , and the circulation of his newspaper increased until it was foremost in Budapest . Then he married Margaret Vaszi , the daughter of his editor , herself a journalist of note . Two years later he was divorced from her , and subsequently he married an actress who had played rôles in his own plays .</p>
    <p n="8">For a portrait of him as he is today you have to think of Oscar Wilde at the height of his glory . A big pudgy face , immobile , pink , smooth-shaven , its child-like expressionlessness accentuated by the monocle he always wears , though rather belied by the gleam of humor in his dark alert eyes . His hair is iron-gray , his figure stocky and of about medium height . A mordant wit , an inimitable raconteur , he loves life and gayety and all the luxuries of life . Nothing can persuade him out of his complacent and comfortable routine . He will not leave Budapest , even to attend the première of one of his plays in nearby Vienna . The post-war political upheaval which has rent all Hungary into two voluble and bitter factions left him quite unperturbed and neutral . His pen is not for politics .</p>
    <p n="9">Yet it is a singularly prolific pen . His novels and short stories are among the finest in Hungarian literature . He has written nine long plays and numerous short ones . A chronology of his more important dramatic works is as follows :</p>
    <p n="10">1902 A DOKTOR UR ( The Doctor ) .</p>
    <p n="11">1904 JOZSI .</p>
    <p n="12">1907 AZ ÖRDÖG ( The Devil ) .</p>
    <p n="13">1909 LILIOM .</p>
    <p n="14">1911 TESTÖR ( Played in this country as “ Where Ignorance is Bliss ” ) .</p>
    <p n="15">1913 A FARKAS ( Played in this country as “ The Phantom Rival ” ) .</p>
    <p n="16">1914 URIDIVAT ( Attorney for Defence ) .</p>
    <p n="17">1919 A HATTYU ( The Swan ) .</p>
    <p n="18">1920 SZINHAZ ( Theatre : Three One-Act Plays ) .</p>
    <p n="19">Undoubtedly the greatest of these is LILIOM . Indeed , I know of no play written in our own time which matches the amazing virtuosity of LILIOM , its imaginative daring , its uncanny blending of naturalism and fantasy , humor and pathos , tenderness and tragedy into a solid dramatic structure . At first reading it may seem a mere improvization in many moods , but closer study must reveal how the moods are as inevitably related to each other as pearls on a string .</p>
    <p n="20">And where in modern dramatic literature can such pearls be matched — Julie incoherently confessing to her dead lover the love she had always been ashamed to tell ; Liliom crying out to the distant carousel the glad news that he is to be a father ; the two thieves gambling for the spoils of their prospective robbery ; Marie and Wolf posing for their portrait while the broken-hearted Julie stands looking after the vanishing Liliom , the thieves ’ song ringing in her ears ; the two policemen grousing about pay and pensions while Liliom lies bleeding to death ; Liliom furtively proffering his daughter the star he has stolen for her in heaven . . . . The temptation to count the whole scintillating string is difficult to resist .</p>
    <p n="21">What is the moral of LILIOM ? Nothing you can reduce to a creed . Molnar is not a preacher or a propagandist for any theory of life . You will look in vain in his plays for moral or dogma . His philosophy — if philosophy you can call it — is always implicit . And nothing is plainer than that his picture of a courtroom in the beyond is neither devoutly nor satirically intended . Liliom 's Heaven is the Heaven of his own imagining . And what is more natural than that it should be an irrational jumble of priest 's purgatory , police magistrate 's justice and his own limited conception of good deeds and evil ?</p>
    <p n="22">For those who hold that every fine dramatic architecture must have its spire of meaning , that by the very selection of character and incident the dramatist writes his commentary on life , there is still an explanation possible . Perhaps Molnar was at the old , old task of revaluing our ideas of good and evil . Perhaps he has only shown how the difference between a bully , a wife-beater and a criminal on the one hand and a saint on the other can be very slight . If one must tag LILIOM with a moral , I prefer to read mine in Liliom 's dying speech to Julie wherein he says : “ Nobody 's right . . . but they all think they are right . . . . A lot they know . ”</p>

     <role>An amusement park on the outskirts of Budapest on a late afternoon in Spring . Barkers stand before the booths of the sideshows haranguing the passing crowd . The strident music of a calliope is heard ; laughter , shouts , the scuffle of feet , the signal bells of merry-go-round</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>The merry-go-round is at Center . LILIOM stands at the entrance , a cigarette in his mouth , coaxing the people in . The girls regard him with idolizing glances and screech with pleasure as he playfully pushes them through entrance . Now and then some girl 's escort resents the familiarity , whereupon LILIOM 'S demeanor becomes ugly and menacing , and the cowed escort slinks through the entrance behind his girl or contents himself with a muttered resentful comment</role>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>One girl hands LILIOM a red carnation ; he rewards her with a bow and a smile . When the soldier who accompanies her protests</role>
     <roleDesc>LILIOM cows him with a fierce glance and a threatening gesture . MARIE and JULIE come out of the crowd and LILIOM favors them with particular notice as they pass into the merry-go-round</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>MRS. MUSKAT</role>
     <roleDesc>comes out of the merry-go-round , bringing LILIOM coffee and rolls . LILIOM mounts the barker 's stand at the entrance , where he is elevated over everyone on the stage . Here he begins his harangue . Everybody turns toward him . The other booths are gradually deserted . The tumult makes it impossible for the audience to hear what he is saying , but every now and then some witticism of his provokes a storm of laughter which is audible above the din . Many people enter the merry-go-round . Here and there one catches a phrase “ Room for one more on the zebra 's back , ” “ Which of you ladies ? ” “ Ten heller for adults , five for children , ” “ Step right up ” ——</roleDesc>
    </castItem>
    <castItem>
     <role>It is growing darker . A lamplighter crosses the stage , and begins unperturbedly lighting the colored gas-lamps . The whistle of a distant locomotive is heard . Suddenly the tumult ceases , the lights go out , and the curtain falls in darkness</role>

Do n't let me catch you in my carousel again . I stand for a whole lot , I have to in my business . It makes no difference to me whether my customers are ladies or the likes of you — as long as they pay their money . But when a girl misbehaves herself on my carousel — out she goes .

     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Are you talking to me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>Yes , you ! You — chamber-maid , you ! In my carousel ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Who did anything in your old carousel ? I paid my fare and took my seat and never said a word , except to my friend here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>No , she never opened her mouth . Liliom came over to her of his own accord .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>It 's all the same . I 'm not going to get in trouble with the police , and lose my license on account of you — you shabby kitchen maid !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Shabby yourself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>You stay out of my carousel ! Letting my barker fool with you ! Are n't you ashamed of yourself ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>What ? What did you say ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>I suppose you think I have no eyes in my head . I see everything that goes on in my carousel . During the whole ride she let Liliom fool with her — the shameless hussy !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>He did not fool with me ! I do n't let any man fool with me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>He leaned against you all through the ride !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>He leaned against the panther . He always leans against something , does n't he ? Everybody leans where he wants . I could n't tell him not to lean , if he always leans , could I ? But he did n't lay a hand on me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>Oh , did n't he ? And I suppose he did n't put his hand around your waist , either ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>And if he did ? What of it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>You hold your tongue ! No one 's asking you — just you keep out of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>He put his arm around my waist — just the same as he does to all the girls . He always does that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>I 'll teach him not to do it any more , my dear . No carryings on in my carousel ! If you are looking for that sort of thing , you 'd better go to the circus ! You 'll find lots of soldiers there to carry on with !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>You keep your soldiers for yourself !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Soldiers ! As if we wanted soldiers !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>Well , I only want to tell you this , my dear , so that we understand each other perfectly . If you ever stick your nose in my carousel again , you 'll wish you had n't ! I 'm not going to lose my license on account of the likes of you ! People who do n't know how to behave , have got to stay out !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>You 're wasting your breath . If I feel like riding on your carousel I 'll pay my ten heller and I 'll ride . I 'd like to see anyone try to stop me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>Just come and try it , my dear — just come and try it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>We 'll see what 'll happen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>Yes , you will see something happen that never happened before in this park .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps you think you could throw me out !</p>

     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>I 'd think twice before I 'd dirty my hands on a common servant girl . I 'll have Liliom throw you out . He knows how to handle your kind .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>You think Liliom would throw me out .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>Yes , my dear , so fast that you wo n't know what happened to you !</p>

     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Will you get out of here ?<stage>Makes a threatening gesture — the four servant girls exit in voluble but fearful haste .</stage></p>

     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>What have you been doing now ?</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>What has she done ? She 's been impudent to me . Just as impudent as she could be ! I put her out of the carousel . Take a good look at this innocent thing , Liliom . She 's never to be allowed in my carousel again !</p>

     <p>If she ever comes again , you 're not to let her in . And if she gets in before you see her , throw her out . Understand ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>What has she done , anyhow ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Agitated and very earnest .</stage>Mister Liliom — tell me please — honest and truly — if I come into the carousel , will you throw me out ?</p>

     <p>Tell me straight to my face , Mister Liliom , would you throw me out ?<stage>They face each other . There is a brief pause .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Yes , little girl , if there was a reason — but if there was no reason , why should I throw you out ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>To MRS. MUSKAT .</stage>There , you see !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Thank you , Mister Liliom .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>And I tell you again , if this little slut dares to set her foot in my carousel , she 's to be thrown out ! I 'll stand for no indecency in my establishment .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>What do you mean — indecency ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>I saw it all . There 's no use denying it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>She says you put your arm around my waist .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>Yes , you ! I saw you . Do n't play the innocent .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Here 's something new ! I 'm not to put my arm around a girl 's waist any more ! I suppose I 'm to ask your permission before I touch another girl !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>You can touch as many girls as you want and as often as you want — for my part you can go as far as you like with any of them — but not this one — I permit no indecency in my carousel .<stage>There is a long pause .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p><stage>To MRS. MUSKAT .</stage>And now I 'll ask you please to shut your mouth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>What ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Shut your mouth quick , and go back to your carousel .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>What ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>What did she do to you , anyhow ? Tryin ’ to start a fight with a little pigeon like that . . . just because I touched her ?— You come to the carousel as often as you want to , little girl . Come every afternoon , and sit on the panther 's back , and if you have n't got the price , Liliom will pay for you . And if anyone dares to bother you , you come and tell me .</p>
    </sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>You seem to think that I can n't throw you out , too . What 's the reason I can n't ? Because you are the best barker in the park ? Well , you are very much mistaken . In fact , you can consider yourself thrown out already . You 're discharged !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Very good .</p>

     <p>Playing the high and mighty , are you ? Conceited pig ! Good-for-nothing !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>You said you 'd throw me out , did n't you ? Well , that suits me ; I 'm thrown out .</p>

     <p>Do you want to ruin my business ?</p>

     <p>Keep away from her !</p>

     <p>A-ha !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>Apologize ? To who ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>To this little pigeon . Well — are you going to do it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>If you give me this whole park on a silver plate , and all the gold of the Rothschilds on top of it — I 'd — I 'd —— Let her dare to come into my carousel again and she 'll get thrown out so hard that she 'll see stars in daylight !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>In that case , dear lady<stage>takes off his cap with a flourish</stage>, you are respectfully requested to get out o ’ here as fast as your legs will carry you — I never beat up a woman yet — except that Holzer woman who I sent to the hospital for three weeks — but — if you do n't get out o ’ here this minute , and let this little squab be , I 'll give you the prettiest slap in the jaw you ever had in your life .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>Very good , my son . Now you can go to the devil . Good-bye . You 're discharged , and you need n't try to come back , either .<stage>She exits . It is beginning to grow dark .</stage></p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>You 're a liar , you are pitying me . I can see it in your face . You 're thinking , now that Madame Muskat has thrown him out , Liliom will have to go begging . Huh ! Look at me . I 'm big enough to get along without a Madame Muskat . I have been thrown out of better jobs than hers .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>What will you do now , Mister Liliom ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Now ? First of all , I 'll go and get myself — a glass of beer . You see , when something happens to annoy me , I always drink a glass of beer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Then you are annoyed about losing your job .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>No , only about where I 'm going to get the beer .</p>

     <p><stage>Bashfully .</stage>Eight heller .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>And you ?<stage>MARIE casts down her eyes and does not reply . LILIOM continues sternly .</stage>I asked you how much you 've got ?<stage>MARIE begins to weep softly .</stage>I understand . Well , you need n't cry about it . You girls stay here , while I go back to the carousel and get my clothes and things . And when I come back , we 'll go to the Hungarian beer-garden . It 's all right , I 'll pay . Keep your money .<stage>He exits . MARIE and JULIE stand silent , watching him until he has gone .</stage></p>

     <p>Are you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>Yes , a little . Why are you looking after him in that funny way ?</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a touch of pride .</stage>It was on our account he lost his job . Because he 's fallen in love with you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>He has n't at all .</p>

     <p>No , it 's true — my heart 's true love ——</p>

     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Who ? Who is he ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>A soldier .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>What kind of a soldier ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know . Just a soldier . Are there different kinds ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Many different kinds . There are hussars , artillerymen , engineers , infantry — that 's the kind that walks — and ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>How can you tell which is which ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>By their uniforms .</p>

     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>After trying to puzzle it out .</stage>The conductors on the street cars — are they soldiers ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Certainly not . They 're conductors .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Well , they have uniforms .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>But they do n't carry swords or guns .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh !<stage>Thinks it over again ; then .</stage>Well , policemen — are they ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a touch of exasperation .</stage>Are they what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Soldiers .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Certainly not . They 're just policemen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Triumphantly .</stage>But they have uniforms — and they carry weapons , too .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>You 're just as dumb as you can be . You do n't go by their uniforms .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>But you said ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>No , I did n't . A letter-carrier wears a uniform , too , but that does n't make him a soldier .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>But if he carried a gun or a sword , would he be ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>No , he 'd still be a letter-carrier . You can n't go by guns or swords , either .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Well , if you do n't go by the uniforms or the weapons , what do you go by ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>By ——<stage>Tries to put it into words ; fails ; then breaks off suddenly .</stage>Oh , you 'll get to know when you 've lived in the city long enough . You 're nothing but a country girl . When you 've lived in the city a year , like I have , you 'll know all about it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Half angrily .</stage>Well , how do you know when you see a real soldier ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>By one thing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>What ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>One thing ——<stage>She pauses . MARIE starts to cry .</stage>Oh , what are you crying about ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Because you 're making fun of me . . . . You 're a city girl , and I 'm just fresh from the country . . . and how am I expected to know a soldier when I see one ? . . . You , you ought to tell me , instead of making fun of me ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>All right . Listen then , cry-baby . There 's only one way to tell a soldier : by his salute ! That 's the only way .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>He salutes me . . . . And if his name is Wolf , that does n't prove he ai n't a soldier — he salutes , and he wears a red cap and he stands on guard all day long outside a big building ——</p>

Meantime it has grown quite dark . During the following scene the gas-lamps far in the distance are lighted one by one . LILIOM and JULIE sit on the bench . From afar , very faintly , comes the music of a calliope . But the music is intermittently heard ; now it breaks off , now it resumes again , as if it came down on a fitful wind . Blending with it are the sounds of human voices , now loud , now soft ; the blare of a toy trumpet ; the confused noises of the show-booths . It grows progressively darker until the end of the scene . There is no moonlight . The spring irridescence glows in the deep blue sky .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Now we 're both discharged .<stage>She does not answer . From now on they speak gradually lower and lower until the end of the scene , which is played almost in whispers . Whistles softly , then .</stage>Have you had your supper ?</p>

     <p>No , I do n't , Mister Liliom .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>I suppose you 'll tell me you do n't know why you 're sitting here — like this , in the dark , alone with me — You would n't ‘ a ’ stayed so quick , if you had n't done it before — with some soldier , maybe . This is n't the first time . You would n't have been so ready to stay if it was — what did you stay for , anyhow ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>So you would n't be left alone .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Alone ! God , you 're dumb ! I do n't need to be alone . I can have all the girls I want . Not only servant girls like you , but cooks and governesses , even French girls . I could have twenty of them if I wanted to .</p>

     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>You were beginning to tell me a story .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , about a sweetheart . You said , one night , just as they were putting out the lights of the carousel —— That 's as far as you got .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Oh , yes , yes , just as the lights were going out , someone came along — a little girl with a big shawl — you know —— She came — eh — from —— Say — tell me — ai n't you — that is , ai n't you at all — afraid of me ? The officer told you what kind of a fellow I am — and that I 'd take your money away from you ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>You could n't take it away — I have n't got any . But if I had — I 'd — I 'd give it to you — I 'd give it all to you .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>You would ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>If you asked me for it .</p>

     <p>A soldier ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>He came from the same village I did .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>That 's what all the soldiers say . Where do you come from , anyway ?</p>

     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Were you in love with him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Why do you keep asking me that all the time , Mister Liliom ? I was n't in love with him . We only went walking together .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Where did you walk ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>In the park .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>And your virtue ? Where did you lose that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>I have n't got any virtue .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Well , you had once .</p>

     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>No , I never had . I 'm a respectable girl .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Yes , but you gave the soldier something .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Why do you question me like that , Mister Liliom ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Did you give him something ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>You have to . But I did n't love him .</p>

     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Do you love me ?</p>
    </sp>

     <p>No , Mister Liliom .</p>

     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Then why do you stay here with me ?</p>

     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Um — nothing .<stage>There is a pause . The music from afar is plainly heard .</stage></p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Want to dance ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>No . I have to be very careful .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Of what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>My — character .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Because I 'm never going to marry . If I was going to marry , it would be different . Then I would n't need to worry so much about my character . It does n't make any difference if you 're married . But I sha n't marry — and that 's why I 've got to take care to be a respectable girl .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Suppose I were to say to you — I 'll marry you .</p>

     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>You ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>That frightens you , does n't it ? You 're thinking of what the officer said and you 're afraid .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>No , I 'm not , Mister Liliom . I do n't pay any attention to what he said .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>But you would n't dare to marry anyone like me , would you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>I know that — that — if I loved anyone — it would n't make any difference to me what he — even if I died for it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>But you would n't marry a rough guy like me — that is ,— eh — if you loved me ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I would — if I loved you , Mister Liliom .<stage>There is a pause .</stage></p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>I think — that even a low-down good-for-nothing — can make a man of himself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Certainly .<stage>They are silent again . A lamp-lighter crosses the stage , lights the lamp over the bench , and exits .</stage></p>

    <stage>THE CURTAIN FALLS</stage>
   </div>
   <div type="scene" n="2">
    <head type="scene">SCENE TWO</head>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCENE — A photographer 's “ studio , ” operated by the HOLLUNDERS , on the</speaker>
     <p>fringe of the park . It is a dilapidated hovel . The general entrance is Back Left . Back Right there is a window with a sofa before it . The outlook is on the amusement park with perhaps a small Ferris-wheel or the scaffolding of a “ scenic-railway ” in the background . The door to the kitchen is up Left and a black-curtained entrance to the dark room is down Left . Just in front of the dark room stands the camera on its tripod . Against the back wall , between the door and window , stands the inevitable photographer 's background-screen , ready to be wheeled into place . It is forenoon . When the curtain rises , MARIE and JULIE are discovered .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>And he beat up Hollinger ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , he gave him an awful licking .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>But Hollinger is bigger than he is .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>He licked him just the same . It is n't size that counts , you know , it 's cleverness . And Liliom 's awful quick .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>And then he was arrested ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , they arrested him , but they let him go the next day . That makes twice in the two months we 've been living here that Liliom 's been arrested and let go again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Why do they let him go ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Because he is innocent .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>MOTHER HOLLUNDER , a very old woman , sharp-tongued , but in reality quite warm-hearted beneath her formidable exterior , enters at back carrying a few sticks of firewood , and scolding , half to herself .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MOTHER HOLLUNDER</speaker>
     <p>Always wanting something , but never willing to work for it . He wo n't work , and he wo n't steal , but he 'll use up a poor old widow 's last bit of firewood . He 'll do that cheerfully enough ! A big , strong lout like that lying around all day resting his lazy bones ! He ought to be ashamed to look decent people in the face .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sorry , Mother Hollunder . . . .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MOTHER HOLLUNDER</speaker>
     <p>Sorry ! Better be sorry the lazy good-for-nothing ai n't in jail where he belongs instead of in the way of honest , hard-working people .<stage>She exits into the kitchen .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Who 's that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Mrs. Hollunder — my aunt . This is her<stage>with a sweeping gesture that takes in the camera , dark room and screen</stage>studio . She lets us live here for nothing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>What 's she fetching the wood for ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>She brings us everything we need . If it were n't for her I do n't know what would become of us . She 's a good-hearted soul even if her tongue is sharp .<stage>There is a pause .</stage></p>

     <p><stage>Shyly .</stage>Do you know — I 've found out . He 's not a soldier .</p>

     <p>Oh , yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Often ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Very often . He 's asked me ——</p>

     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>To marry you ?</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Abashed , yet a bit boastfully .</stage>Do you know what I 'm doing — I 'm flirting with him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Flirting ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes . He asks me to go to the park — and I say I can n't go . Then he coaxes me , and promises me a new scarf for my head if I go . But I do n't go — even then . . . . So then he walks all the way home with me — and I bid him good-night at the door .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Is that what you call flirting ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Um-hm ! It 's sinful , but it 's so thrilling .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Do you ever quarrel ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Grandly .</stage>Only when our Passionate Love surges up .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Your passionate love ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes . . . . He takes my hand and we walk along together . Then he wants to swing hands , but I wo n't let him . I say : “ Do n't swing my hand ” ; and he says , “ Do n't be so stubborn . ” And then he tries to swing my hand again , but still I do n't let him . And for a long time I do n't let him — until in the end I let him . Then we walk along swinging hands — up and down , up and down — just like this . That is Passionate Love . It 's sinful , but it 's awfully thrilling .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>You 're happy , are n't you ?</p>
    </sp>

      <l>Happier than — anything —— But the most beautiful thing on earth is</l>
      <l>Ideal Love .</l>
     </lg>

    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>What kind is that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Daylight comes about three in the morning this time of the year . When we 've been up that long we 're all through with flirting and Passionate Love — and then our Ideal Love comes to the surface . It comes like this : I 'll be sitting on the bench and Wolf , he holds my hand tight — and he puts his cheek against my cheek and we do n't talk . . . we just sit there very quiet . . . . And after a while he gets sleepy , and his head sinks down , and he falls asleep . . . but even in his sleep he holds tight to my hand . And I — I sit perfectly still just looking around me and taking long , deep breaths — for by that time it 's morning and the trees and flowers are fresh with dew . But Wolf does n't smell anything because he 's so fast asleep . And I get awfully sleepy myself , but I do n't sleep . And we sit like that for a long time . That is Ideal Love ——<stage>There is a long pause .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Regretfully ; uneasily .</stage>He went out last night and he has n't come home yet .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Here are sixteen Kreuzer . It was supposed to be carfare to take my young lady to the conservatory — eight there and eight back — but I made her walk . Here — save it with the rest .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>This makes three gulden , forty-six .</p>

     <p>He wo n't work at all .</p>

     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Too lazy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>No . He never learned a trade , you see , and he can n't just go and be a day-laborer — so he just does nothing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>That ai n't right .</p>

     <p>They 've had three since you left . You know , Wolf 's going to take a new job . He 's going to work for the city . He 'll get rent free , too .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>He wo n't go back to work at the carousel either . I ask him why , but he wo n't tell me —— Last Monday he hit me .</p>

     <speaker>MOTHER HOLLUNDER</speaker>
     <p>He wants to take her out of this and marry her . This is the fifth time he 's been here . He has two children , but ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Please do n't bother , Aunt Hollunder , I 'll get the water myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MOTHER HOLLUNDER</speaker>
     <p>He 's waiting outside now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Send him away .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MOTHER HOLLUNDER</speaker>
     <p>He 'll only come back again — and first thing you know that vagabond will get jealous and there 'll be a fight .<stage>Goes out , muttering .</stage>Oh , he 's ready enough to fight , he is . Strike a poor little girl like that ! Ought to be ashamed of himself ! And the police just let him go on doing as he pleases .<stage>Still scolding , she exits at back .</stage></p>

     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>A carpenter wants to marry you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Why do n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Because ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Liliom does n't support you , and he beats you — he thinks he can do whatever he likes just because he 's Liliom . He 's a bad one .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>He 's not really bad .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>That night you sat on the bench together — he was gentle then .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , he was gentle .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>And afterwards he got wild again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Afterwards he got wild — sometimes . But that night on the bench . . . he was gentle . He 's gentle now , sometimes , very gentle . After supper , when he stands there and listens to the music of the carousel , something comes over him — and he is gentle .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Does he say anything ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>He does n't say anything . He gets thoughtful and very quiet , and his big eyes stare straight ahead of him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Into your eyes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Not exactly . He 's unhappy because he is n't working . That 's really why he hit me on Monday .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>That 's a fine reason for hitting you ! Beats his wife because he is n't working , the ruffian !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>It preys on his mind ——</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Did he hurt you ?</p>

     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>Gone out ?</p>

     <p>You 've got a lot of gall — to come here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>Are you the lady of the house , my dear ? Better look out or you 'll get a slap in the mouth .</p>

     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>How dare you set foot in Julie 's house ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p><stage>To JULIE .</stage>Pay no attention to her , my child . You know what brings me here . That vagabond , that good-for-nothing , I 've come to give him his bread and butter back .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>He 's not dependent on you for his bread .</p>

     <p>Yes , sixty-six .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Good-bye .<stage>She exits . JULIE starts to go toward the kitchen .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>I paid him a krone a day , and on Sunday a gulden . And he got all the beer and cigars he wanted from the customers .<stage>JULIE pauses on the threshold , but does not answer .</stage>And he 'd rather starve than beg my pardon . Well , I do n't insist on that . I 'll take him back without it .<stage>JULIE does not answer .</stage>The fact is the people ask for him — and , you see , I 've got to consider business first . It 's nothing to me if he starves . I would n't be here at all , if it was n't for business ——<stage>She pauses , for LILIOM and FICSUR have entered .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Mrs. Muskat is here .</p>

     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>I see she is .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>You might say good-morning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>What for ? And what do you want , anyhow ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>I do n't want anything .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Then keep your mouth shut . Next thing you 'll be starting to nag again about my being out all night and out of work and living on your relations ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>I 'm not saying anything .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>But it 's all on the tip of your tongue — I know you — now do n't start or you 'll get another .<stage>He paces angrily up and down . They are all a bit afraid of him , and shrink and look away as he passes them . FICSUR shambles from place to place , his eyes cast down as if he were searching for something on the floor .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p><stage>Suddenly , to FICSUR .</stage>You 're always dragging him out to play cards and drink with you . I 'll have you locked up , I will .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>I do n't want to talk to you . You 're too common .<stage>He goes out by the door at back and lingers there in plain view . There is a pause .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Mrs. Muskat is here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Well , why does n't she open her mouth , if she has anything to say ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>Why do you go around with this man Ficsur ? He 'll get you mixed up in one of his robberies first thing you know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>What 's it to you who I go with ? I do what I please . What do you want ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>You know what I want .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>No , I do n't .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>What do you suppose I want ? Think I 've come just to pay a social call ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Do I owe you anything ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>Yes , you do — but that 's not what I came for . You 're a fine one to come to for money ! You earn so much these days ! You know very well what I 'm here for .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>You 've got Hollinger at the carousel , have n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>Sure I have .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Well , what else do you want ? He 's as good as I am .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>You 're quite right , my boy . He 's every bit as good as you are . I 'd not dream of letting him go . But one is n't enough any more . There 's work enough for two ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>One was enough when I was there .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>Well , I might let Hollinger go ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Why let him go , if he 's so good ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p><stage>Shrugs her shoulders .</stage>Yes , he 's good .<stage>Not once until now has she looked at LILIOM .</stage></p>

     <p><stage>To JULIE .</stage>Ask your aunt if I can have a cup of coffee .<stage>JULIE exits into the kitchen .</stage>So Hollinger is good , is he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p><stage>Crosses to him and looks him , in the face .</stage>Why do n't you stay home and sleep at night ? You 're a sight to look at .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>He 's good , is he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>Push your hair back from your forehead .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Let my hair be . It 's nothing to you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>All right . But if I 'd told you to let it hang down over your eyes you 'd have pushed it back — I hear you 've been beating her , this — this ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>None of your business .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>You 're a fine fellow ! Beating a skinny little thing like that ! If you 're tired of her , leave her , but there 's no use beating the poor ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Leave her , eh ? You 'd like that , would n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>Do n't flatter yourself .<stage>Quite embarrassed .</stage>Serves me right , too . If I had any sense I would n't have run after you —— My God , the things one must do for the sake of business ! If I could only sell the carousel I would n't be sitting here . . . . Come , Liliom , if you have any sense , you 'll come back . I 'll pay you well .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>The carousel is crowded just the same . . . without me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>Crowded , yes — but it 's not the same .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Then you admit that you do miss me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>Miss you ? Not I . But the silly girls miss you . They 're always asking for you . Well , are you going to be sensible and come back ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>And leave — her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>You beat her , do n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>No , I do n't beat her . What 's all this damn fool talk about beating her ? I hit her once — that was all — and now the whole city seems to be talking about it . You do n't call that beating her , do you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>All right , all right . I take it back . I do n't want to get mixed up in it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Beating her ! As if I 'd beat her ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>I can n't make out why you 're so concerned about her . You 've been married to her two months — it 's plain to see that you 're sick of it — and out there is the carousel — and the show booths — and money — and you 'd throw it all away . For what ? Heavens , how can anyone be such a fool ?<stage>Looks at him appraisingly .</stage>Where have you been all night ? You look awful .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>It 's no business of yours .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>You never used to look like that . This life is telling on you .<stage>Pauses .</stage>Do you know — I 've got a new organ .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Softly .</stage>I know .</p>

     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>How did you know ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>You can hear it — from here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>It 's a good one , eh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Wistfully .</stage>Very good . Fine . It roars and snorts — so fine .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>You should hear it close by — it 's heavenly . Even the carousel seems to know . . . it goes quicker . I got rid of those two horses — you know , the ones with the broken ears ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>What have you put in their place ?</p>

     <p>Zebras ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>No — an automobile .</p>

     <p><stage>Transported .</stage>An automobile ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>Yes . If you 've got any sense you 'll come back . What good are you doing here ? Out there is your art , the only thing you 're fit for . You are an artist , not a respectable married man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Leave her — this little ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>She 'll be better off . She 'll go back and be a servant girl again . As for you — you 're an artist and you belong among artists . All the beer you want , cigars , a krone a day and a gulden on Sunday , and the girls , Liliom , the girls — I 've always treated you right , have n't I ? I bought you a watch , and ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>She 's not that kind . She 'd never be a servant girl again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>I suppose you think she 'd kill herself . Do n't worry . Heavens , if every girl was to commit suicide just because her ——<stage>Finishes with a gesture .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Stares at her a moment , considering , then with sudden , smiling animation .</stage>So the people do n't like Hollinger ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>You know very well they do n't , you rascal .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Well ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>You 've always been happy at the carousel . It 's a great life — pretty girls and beer and cigars and music — a great life and an easy one . I 'll tell you what — come back and I 'll give you a ring that used to belong to my dear departed husband . Well , will you come ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>She 's not that kind . She 'd never be a servant girl again . But — but — for my part — if I decide — that need n't make any difference . I can go on living with her even if I do go back to my art ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>My God !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>What 's the matter ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. MUSKAT</speaker>
     <p>Who ever heard of a married man — I suppose you think all girls would be pleased to know that you were running home to your wife every night . It 's ridiculous ! When the people found out they 'd laugh themselves sick ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>

     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>You can hit me again if you like — do n't look at me like that . I 'm not afraid of you . . . . I 'm not afraid of anyone . I told you I had something to tell you .</p>

     <p>Yes ——</p>

     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Did I ? I guess I meant the carpenter .</p>

     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>I 've been — what ? The carpenter ? No . It 's something entirely different — it 's awful hard to tell — but you 'll have to know sooner or later — I 'm not a bit — scared — because it 's a perfectly natural thing ——</p>

     <p>How much ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>More than you ever had in your life before . You leave it to an old hand like me .</p>

     <speaker>MOTHER HOLLUNDER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Enters from the kitchen .</stage>In the morning he must have his coffee , and at noon his soup , and in the evening coffee again — and plenty of firewood — and I 'm expected to furnish it all . Give me back my cup and saucer .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>The show booths of the amusement-park have opened for business . The familiar noises begin to sound ; clear above them all , but far in the distance , sounds the organ of the carousel .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Now , Aunt Hollunder .<stage>From now until the fall of the curtain it is apparent that the sound of the organ makes him more and more uneasy .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MOTHER HOLLUNDER</speaker>
     <p>And you , you vagabond , get out of here this minute or I 'll call my son ——</p>

     <p>This scheme — about the cashier of the leather factory — there 's money in it ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>Lots of money — but — it takes two to pull it off .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Meditatively .</stage>Yes .<stage>Uneasily .</stage>All right , Ficsur . Go away — and come back later .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>FICSUR vanishes . The organ in the distant carousel drones incessantly . LILIOM listens a while , then goes to the door and calls .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Aunt Hollunder !<stage>With naïve joy .</stage>Julie 's going to have a baby .<stage>Then he goes to the window , jumps on the sofa , looks out . Suddenly , in a voice that overtops the droning of the organ , he shouts as if addressing the far-off carousel .</stage>I 'm going to be a father .</p>

     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coming down from the sofa .</stage>Nothing .<stage>Throws himself on the sofa , buries his face in the cushion . JULIE watches him a moment , comes over to him and covers him with a shawl . Then she goes on tip-toe to the door at back and remains standing in the doorway , looking out and listening to the droning of the organ .</stage></p>

    <stage>JULIE , troubled and uneasy , looks from one to the other , then exits into the kitchen .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p><stage>When she has gone , comes quickly over to LILIOM and speaks furtively .</stage>As you go down Franzen Street you come to the railroad embankment . Beyond that — all the way to the leather factory — there 's not a thing in sight , not even a watchman 's hut .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>And does he always come that way ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>Yes . Not along the embankment , but down below along the path across the fields . Since last year he 's been going alone . Before that he always used to have someone with him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Every Saturday ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>Every Saturday .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>And the money ? Where does he keep it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>In a leather bag . The whole week 's pay for the workmen at the factory .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Much ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>Sixteen thousand kronen . Quite a haul , what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>What 's his name ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>Linzman . He 's a Jew .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>The cashier ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>Yes — but when he gets a knife between his ribs — or if I smash his skull for him — he wo n't be a cashier any more .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Does he have to be killed ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>No , he does n't have to be . He can give up the money without being killed — but most of these cashiers are peculiar — they 'd rather be killed .</p>

    <stage>JULIE reënters , pretends to get something on the other side of the room , then exits at back . During the ensuing dialogue she keeps coming in and out in the same way , showing plainly that she is suspicious and anxious . She attempts to overhear what they are saying and , in spite of their caution , does catch a word here and there , which adds to her disquiet . FICSUR , catching sight of her , abruptly changes the conversation .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>And the next verse is :</l>

     <p>What then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>We bury the money for six months . That 's the usual time . And after the sixth month we dig it up again .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>And then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>Then you go on living just as usual for six months more — you do n't touch a heller of the money .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>In six months the baby will be born .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>Then we 'll take the baby with us , too . Three months before the time you 'll go to work so as to be able to say you saved up your wages to get to America .</p>

     <p>Which of us goes up and talks to him ?</p>

     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Outside . . . like the rattle of swords .<stage>FICSUR listens . After a pause , LILIOM continues .</stage>What do I say to him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>And then what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>

      <l>By that time I 'll have stuck him — and then you take your knife ——</l>

     <p>Yes , full length .<stage>MOTHER HOLLUNDER pushes out the camera while her son poses the POLICEMAN , runs from him to the camera and back again , now altering the pose , now ducking under the black cloth and pushing the camera nearer . Meanwhile MOTHER HOLLUNDER has fetched a plate from the dark room and thrust it in the camera . While this is going on , LILIOM and FICSUR , their heads together , speak in very low tones .</stage></p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>

     <speaker>WOLF</speaker>
     <p>We 've rented two rooms for ourselves to start with — and if things go well ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Then we 'll buy a house in the country .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WOLF</speaker>
     <p>If one only tends to business and keeps honest . Of course , in the country we 'll miss the city life , but if the good Lord sends us children — it 's much healthier for children in the country .<stage>There is a brief pause .</stage></p>

     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Wolf 's nice looking , is n't he ?</p>

     <p>Yes .</p>

     <p>The only thing is — he 's a Jew .</p>

     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , well , you can get used to that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Well , are n't you going to wish us luck ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Of course I do .<stage>She embraces MARIE .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>And are n't you going to kiss Wolf , too ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Him , too .<stage>She embraces WOLF , remains quite still a moment , her head resting on his shoulder .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WOLF</speaker>
     <p>Why are you crying , my dear Mrs .——<stage>He looks questioningly at MARIE over JULIE 'S shoulder .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Because she has such a good heart .<stage>She becomes sentimental , too .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WOLF</speaker>
     <p><stage>Touched .</stage>We thank you for your heartfelt sympathy ——<stage>He cannot restrain his own tears . There is a pause before MOTHER HOLLUNDER and her son enter . YOUNG HOLLUNDER immediately busies himself with the camera .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MOTHER HOLLUNDER</speaker>
     <p>Now if you do n't mind , we 'll do it right away , before it gets too dark .<stage>She leads MARIE and WOLF into position before the background-screen . Here they immediately fall into an awkward pose , smiling mechanically .</stage>Full length ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Please . Both figures full length .</p>

     <p>Yes .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MOTHER HOLLUNDER , YOUNG HOLLUNDER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Speak in unison , in loud professionally-expressionless tones .</stage>The lady looks at the gentleman and the gentleman looks straight into the camera .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MOTHER HOLLUNDER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Poses first MARIE , then WOLF .</stage>Now , if you please .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>YOUNG HOLLUNDER</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Who has crept under the black cloth , calls in muffled tones .</stage>
      <l>That 's good — that 's very good !</l>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Stonily rigid , but very happy , trying to speak without altering her expression .</stage>Julie , dear , do we look all right ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>YOUNG HOLLUNDER</speaker>
     <p>Now , if you please , hold still . I 'll count up to three , and then you must hold perfectly still .<stage>Grasps the cover of the lens and calls threateningly .</stage>One — two — three !<stage>He removes the cover ; there is utter silence . But as he speaks the word “ one ” there is heard , very faintly in the distance , the refrain of the thieves ’ song which FICSUR and LILIOM have been singing . The refrain continues until the fall of the curtain . As he speaks the word “ three ” everybody is perfectly rigid save JULIE , who lets her head sink slowly to the table . The distant refrain dies out .</stage></p>

    <head type="scene">SCENE FOUR</head>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCENE — In the fields on the outskirts of the city . At back a railroad</speaker>
     <p>embankment crosses the stage obliquely . At Center of the embankment stands a red and white signal flag , and near it a little red signal lamp which is not yet lighted . Here also a wooden stairway leads up to the embankment . At the foot of the embankment to the right is a pile of used railroad ties . In the background a telegraph pole , beyond it a view of trees , fences and fields ; still further back a factory building and a cluster of little dwellings . It is six o'clock of the same afternoon . Dusk has begun to fall .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM and FICSUR are discovered on the stairway looking after the</speaker>
     <p>train which has just passed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Can you still hear it snort ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>Listen !<stage>They watch the vanishing train .</stage></p>

      <l>If you put your ear on the tracks you can hear it go all the way to</l>

     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>Huh !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>The one that just puffed past us — it goes all the way to Vienna .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>No further ?</p>

     <p>Yes — further , too .<stage>There is a pause .</stage></p>

     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>It must be near six .<stage>As LILIOM ascends the steps .</stage>Where are you going ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Do n't be afraid . I 'm not giving you the slip .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>Why should you give me the slip ? That cashier has sixteen thousand kronen on him . Just be patient till he comes , then you can talk to him , nice and polite .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>I say , “ Good evening — excuse me , sir ; what time is it ? ”</p>

     <p>Then he tells you what time it is .</p>

     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Suppose he do n't come ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coming down the steps .</stage>Nonsense ! He 's got to come . He pays off the workmen every Saturday . And this is Saturday , ai n't it ?<stage>LILIOM has ascended to the top of the stairway and is gazing along the tracks .</stage>What are you looking at up there ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>The tracks go on and on — there 's no end to them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>What 's that to stare about ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Nothing — only I always look after the train . When you stand down there at night it snorts past you , and spits down .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>Spits ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Yes , the engine . It spits down . And then the whole train rattles past and away — and you stand there — spat on — but it draws your eyes along with it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>Draws your eyes along ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Yes — whether you want to or not , you 've got to look after it — as long as the tiniest bit of it is in sight .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>Swell people sit in it .</p>

     <p>Not yet .<stage>Silence again . LILIOM comes down , speaks low , confidentially .</stage>Do you hear the telegraph wires ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <lg>
      <l>Even when the wind does n't blow you can hear them humming , humming ——</l>

    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>Who ?</p>

     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Jews .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>No — they telegraph .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>They talk through them and from some other place they get answered . And it all goes through the iron strings — that 's why they hum like that — they hum-m ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>What do they hum ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>They hum ! ninety-nine , ninety-nine . Just listen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>What for ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>That sparrow 's listening , too . He 's cocked one eye and looks at me as if to say : “ I 'd like to know what they 're talking about . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>You 're looking at a bird ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>He 's looking at me , too .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>Listen , you 're sick ! There 's something the matter with you . Do you know what it is ? Money . That bird has no money , either ; that 's why he cocks his eye .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Maybe .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>Whoever has money do n't cock his eye .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>What then does he do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>He does most anything he wants . But nobody works unless he has money . We 'll soon have money ourselves .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>I say , “ Good evening . Excuse me , sir , can you tell me what time it is ! ”</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>He 's not coming yet . Got the cards ?<stage>LILIOM gives him the pack of cards .</stage>Got any money ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Takes some coins from his trousers pocket and counts .</stage>Eleven .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sits astride on the pile of ties and looks off left .</stage>All right — eleven .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sitting astride on the ties facing him .</stage>Put it up .</p>

     <p>No .</p>

     <p>Then the game 's over — unless you want to ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>What ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>You 'll trust me ?</p>

     <p>No — but — I 'll deduct it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Deduct it from what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>From your share of the money . If you win you deduct from my share .</p>
    </sp>

     <p><stage>Looks over his shoulder to see if the cashier is coming ; nervous and ashamed .</stage>All right . How much is bank ?</p>

    <sp>

     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Good .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>Me ? Do I look like a cheat ?<stage>Deals the cards again .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Glances nervously over his shoulder .</stage>A thousand .</p>

     <p><stage>Nonchalantly .</stage>Kronen ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Kronen .<stage>He gets a card .</stage>Another one .<stage>Gets another card .</stage>Over again !<stage>Like an inexperienced gambler who is losing heavily , LILIOM is very nervous . He plays dazedly , wildly , irrationally . From now on it is apparent that his only thought is to win his money back .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>That makes twelve hundred you owe .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Double or nothing .<stage>He gets a card . He is greatly excited .</stage>Another one .<stage>Gets another card .</stage>Another .<stage>Throws down three cards .</stage></p>
    </sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Now what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p><stage>Takes a card out of the deck and gives it to him .</stage>Here 's the red ace . You can play double or nothing again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Eagerly .</stage>Good .<stage>Gets another card .</stage>Enough .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p><stage>Turns up his own cards .</stage>Nineteen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>You win again .<stage>Almost imploring .</stage>Give me an ace again . Give me the green one .<stage>Takes a card .</stage>Double or nothing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>Not any more .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Why not ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>Because if you lose you wo n't be able to pay . Double would be nine thousand six hundred . And you 've only got eight thousand altogether .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Greatly excited .</stage>That — that — I call that — a dirty trick !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>Three thousand , two hundred . That 's all you can put up .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Eagerly .</stage>All right , then — three thousand , two hundred .<stage>FICSUR deals him a card .</stage>Enough .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>I 've got an ace myself . Now we 'll have to take our time and squeeze ‘ em .<stage>LILIOM pushes closer to him , as he takes up his cards and slowly , intently unfolds them .</stage>Twenty-one .<stage>He quickly puts the cards in his pocket . There is a pause .</stage></p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Now — now — I 'll tell you now — you 're a crook , a low-down ——<stage>Now LINZMAN enters at Right . He is a strong , robust , red-bearded Jew about 40 years of age . At his side he carries a leather bag slung by a strap from his shoulder . FICSUR coughs warningly , moves to the right between LINZMAN and the embankment , pauses just behind LINZMAN and follows him . LILIOM stands bewildered a few paces to the left of the railroad ties . He finds himself facing LINZMAN . Trembling in every limb .</stage>Good evening . Excuse me , sir , can you tell me the time ?<stage>FICSUR springs silently at LINZMAN , the little knife in his right hand . But LINZMAN catches FICSUR 'S right hand with his own left and forces FICSUR to his knees . Simultaneously LINZMAN thrusts his right hand into his coat pocket and produces a revolver which he points at LILIOM 'S breast . LILIOM is standing two paces away from the revolver .

     <p><stage>In a low , even voice .</stage>It is twenty-five minutes past six .<stage>Pauses , looks ironically down at FICSUR .</stage>It 's lucky I grabbed the hand with the knife instead of the other one .<stage>Pauses again , looks appraisingly from one to the other .</stage>Two fine birds !<stage>To FICSUR .</stage>I should live so — Rothschild has more luck than you .<stage>To LILIOM .</stage>I 'd advise you to keep nice and quiet . If you make one move , you 'll get two bullets in you . Just look into the barrel . You 'll see some little things in there made of lead .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>Let me go . I did n't do anything .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LINZMAN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Mockingly shakes the hand which still holds the knife .</stage>And this ? What do you call this ? Oh , yes , I know . You thought I had an apple in my pocket , and you wanted to peel it . That 's it . Forgive me for my error . I beg your pardon , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>But I — I ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LINZMAN</speaker>
     <p>Yes , my son , I know . It 's so simple . You only asked what time it is . Well , it 's twenty-five minutes after six .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>Let us go , honorable sir . We did n't do anything to you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LINZMAN</speaker>
     <p>In the first place , my son , I 'm not an honorable sir . In the second place , for the same money , you could have said Your Excellency . But in the third place you 'll find it very hard to beg off by flattering me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>But I — I really did n't do anything to you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LINZMAN</speaker>
     <p>Look behind you , my boy . Do n't be afraid . Look behind you , but do n't run away or I 'll have to shoot you down .<stage>LILIOM turns his head slowly around .</stage>Who 's coming up there ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking at LINZMAN .</stage>Policemen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LINZMAN</speaker>
     <p><stage>To FICSUR .</stage>You hold still , or ——<stage>To LILIOM teasingly .</stage>How many policemen are there ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p><stage>His eyes cast down .</stage>Two .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LINZMAN</speaker>
     <p>And what are the policemen sitting on ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Horses .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LINZMAN</speaker>
     <p>And which can run faster , a horse or a man ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>A horse .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LINZMAN</speaker>
     <p>There , you see . It would be hard to get away now .<stage>Laughs .</stage>I never saw such an unlucky pair of highway robbers . I can n't imagine worse luck . Just today I had to put a pistol in my pocket . And even if I had n't — old Linzman is a match for four like you . But even that is n't all . Did you happen to notice , you oxen , what direction I came from ? From the factory , did n't I ? When I went there I had a nice bit of money with me . Sixteen thousand crowns ! But now — not a heller .<stage>Calls off left .</stage>Hey , come quicker , will you ? This fellow is pulling pretty strong .<stage>FICSUR frees himself with a mighty wrench and darts rapidly off . As LINZMAN aims his pistol at the vanishing FICSUR , LILIOM runs up the steps to the embankment . LINZMAN hesitates , perceives that LILIOM is the better target , points the pistol at him .</stage>Stop , or I 'll shoot !<stage>Calls off left to the POLICEMEN .</stage>Why do n't you come down off your horses ?<stage>His pistol is leveled at LILIOM , who stands on the embankment , facing the audience . From the left on the embankment a POLICEMAN appears , revolver in hand .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FIRST POLICEMAN</speaker>
     <p>Stop !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LINZMAN</speaker>
     <p>Well , my boy , do you still want to know what time it is ? From ten to twelve years in prison !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>You wo n't get me !<stage>LINZMAN laughs derisively . LILIOM is now three or four paces from the POLICEMAN and equally distant from LINZMAN . His face is uplifted to the sky . He bursts into laughter , half defiant , half self-pitying , and takes the kitchen knife from under his coat .</stage>Julie ——<stage>The ring of farewell is in the word . He turns sideways , thrusts the knife deep in his breast , sways , falls and rolls down the far side of the embankment . There is a long pause . From the left up on the embankment come the TWO POLICEMEN .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LINZMAN</speaker>
     <p>What 's the matter ?<stage>The FIRST POLICEMAN comes along the embankment as far as the steps , looks down in the opposite side , then climbs down at about the spot where LILIOM disappeared . LINZMAN and the other POLICEMAN mount the embankment and look down on him .</stage>Stabbed himself ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VOICE OF FIRST POLICEMAN</speaker>
     <p>Yes — and he seems to have made a thorough job of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LINZMAN</speaker>
     <p><stage>Excitedly to the SECOND POLICEMAN .</stage>I 'll go and telephone to the hospital .<stage>He runs down the steps and exits at left .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SECOND POLICEMAN</speaker>
     <p>Go to Eisler 's grocery store and telephone to the factory from there . They 've a doctor there , too .<stage>Calling down to the other POLICEMAN .</stage>I 'm going to tie up the horses .<stage>Comes down the steps and exits at left . The stage is empty . There is a pause . The little red signal lamp is lit .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VOICE OF FIRST POLICEMAN</speaker>
     <p>Hey , Stephan !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VOICE OF SECOND POLICEMAN</speaker>
     <p>What ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VOICE OF FIRST POLICEMAN</speaker>
     <p>Shall I pull the knife out of his chest ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VOICE OF SECOND POLICEMAN</speaker>
     <p>Better not , or he may bleed to death .<stage>There is a pause .</stage></p>

     <p>Yes .</p>

     <speaker>VOICE OF FIRST POLICEMAN</speaker>
     <p>Got a cigar ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VOICE OF SECOND POLICEMAN</speaker>
     <p>No .<stage>There is a pause . The FIRST POLICEMAN appears over the opposite side of the embankment .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FIRST POLICEMAN</speaker>
     <p>A lot of good the new pay-schedule 's done us — made things worse than they used to be — we get more but we have less than we ever had . If the Government could be made to realize that . It 's a thankless job at best . You work hard year after year , you get gray in the service , and slowly you die — yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SECOND POLICEMAN</speaker>
     <p>That 's right .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Yes .<stage>In the distance is heard the bell of the signal tower .</stage></p>

     <speaker>MOTHER HOLLUNDER , her son , MARIE and WOLF stand in a group back</speaker>
     <p>right , their heads together . JULIE stands apart from them , a few paces to the left .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>YOUNG HOLLUNDER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Who has just come in , tells his story excitedly .</stage>They 're bringing him now . Two workmen from the factory are carrying him on a stretcher .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WOLF</speaker>
     <p>Where is the doctor ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>YOUNG HOLLUNDER</speaker>
     <p>A policeman telephoned to headquarters . The police-surgeon ought to be here any minute .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>Maybe they 'll pull him through after all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>YOUNG HOLLUNDER</speaker>
     <p>He stabbed himself too deep in his chest . But he 's still breathing . He can still talk , too , but very faintly . At first he lay there unconscious , but when they put him on the stretcher he came to .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WOLF</speaker>
     <p>That was from the shaking .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>
     <p>We 'd better make room .<stage>They make room . Two workmen carry in LILIOM on a stretcher which has four legs and stands about as high as a bed . They put the stretcher at left directly in front of the sofa , so that the head is at right and the foot at left . Then they unobtrusively join the group at the door . Later , they go out . JULIE is standing at the side of the stretcher , where , without moving , she can see LILIOM 'S face . The others crowd emotionally together near the door . The FIRST POLICEMAN enters .</stage></p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>FIRST POLICEMAN</speaker>
     <p>Are you his wife ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>FIRST POLICEMAN</speaker>
     <p>The doctor at the factory who bandaged him up forbade us to take him to the hospital .— Dangerous to move him that far . What he needs now is rest . Just let him be until the police-surgeon comes .<stage>To the group near the door .</stage>He 's not to be disturbed .<stage>They make way for him . He exits . There is a pause .</stage></p>

     <p><stage>To JULIE .</stage>Julie , what do you think ?<stage>JULIE looks at her without answering .</stage>Julie , can I do anything to help ?<stage>JULIE does not answer .</stage>We 'll be just outside on the bench if you want us .<stage>MOTHER HOLLUNDER and her son have gone out when first requested . Now MARIE and WOLF exit , too . JULIE sits on the edge of the stretcher and looks at LILIOM . He stretches his hand out to her . She clasps it . It is not quite dark yet .

     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Raises himself with difficulty ; speaks lightly at first , but later soberly , defiantly .</stage>Little — Julie — there 's something — I want to tell you — like when you go to a restaurant — and you 've finished eating — and it 's time — to pay — then you have to count up everything — everything you owe — well — I beat you — not because I was mad at you — no — only because I can n't bear to see anyone crying . You always cried — on my account — and , well , you see ,— I never learned a trade — what kind of a caretaker would I make ? But anyhow — I was n't going back to the carousel to fool with the girls . No , I spit on them all — understand ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>And — as for Hollinger — he 's good enough — Mrs. Muskat can get along all right with him . The jokes he tells are mine — and the people laugh when he tells them — but I do n't care .— I did n't give you anything — no home — not even the food you ate — but you do n't understand .— It 's true I 'm not much good — but I could n't be a caretaker — and so I thought maybe it would be better over there — in America — do you see ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>I 'm not asking — forgiveness — I do n't do that — I do n't . Tell the baby — if you like .</p>

     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Tell the baby — I was n't much good — but tell him — if you ever talk about me — tell him — I thought — perhaps — over in America — but that 's no affair of yours . I 'm not asking forgiveness . For my part the police can come now .— If it 's a boy — if it 's a girl .— Perhaps I 'll see the Lord God today .— Do you think I 'll see Him ?</p>

     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>I 'm not afraid — of the police Up There — if they 'll only let me come up in front of the Lord God Himself — not like down here where an officer stops you at the door . If the carpenter asks you — yes — be his wife — marry him . And the child — tell him he 's his father .— He 'll believe you — wo n't he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>When I beat you — I was right .— You must n't always think — you must n't always be right .— Liliom can be right once , too .— It 's all the same to me who was right .— It 's so dumb . Nobody 's right — but they all think they are right .— A lot they know !</p>

     <speaker>MARIE</speaker>

JULIE puts the candle on the table near LILIOM 'S head , sits on the edge of the stretcher , looks into the dead man 's face and caresses it tenderly .</stage>Sleep , Liliom , sleep — it 's no business of hers — I never even told you — but now I 'll tell you — now I 'll tell you — you bad , quick-tempered , rough , unhappy , wicked — dear boy — sleep peacefully , Liliom — they can n't understand how I feel — I can n't even explain to you — not even to you — how I feel — you 'd only laugh at me — but you can n't hear me any more .<stage>Between tender motherliness and reproach , yet with great love in her voice .</stage>It was wicked of you to beat me — on the breast and on the head and face — but you 're gone now .— You treated me badly — that was wicked of you — but sleep peacefully , Liliom — you bad , bad boy , you — I love you — I never told you before — I was ashamed — but now I 've told you — I love you , Liliom — sleep — my boy — sleep .<stage>She rises , gets a Bible , sits down near the candle and reads softly to herself , so that , not the words , but an inarticulate murmur is heard . The CARPENTER enters at back .</stage></p>

     <speaker>CARPENTER</speaker>
     <p>Do n't be offended , Miss Julie , but I 'd like to know — you see , I 'm not a young man any more — I have two children — and if I 'm to come back any more — I 'd like to know — if there 's any use ——</p>

     <speaker>CARPENTER</speaker>
     <p><stage>As he exits .</stage>God be with you .<stage>JULIE resumes her reading . FICSUR enters , slinks furtively sideways to the stretcher , looks at LILIOM , shakes his head . JULIE looks up from her reading . FICSUR takes fright , slinks away from the stretcher , sits down at right , biting his nails . JULIE rises . FICSUR rises , too , and looks at her half fearfully . With her piercing glance upon him he slinks to the doorway at back , where he pauses and speaks .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FICSUR</speaker>
     <p>The old woman asked me to tell you that coffee is ready , and you are to come in .<stage>JULIE goes to the kitchen door . FICSUR withdraws until she has closed the door behind her . Then he reappears in the doorway , stands on tiptoes , looks at LILIOM , then exits . Now the body lies alone . After a brief silence music is heard , distant at first , but gradually coming nearer . It is very much like the music of the carousel , but slower , graver , more exalted . The melody , too , is the same , yet the tempo is altered and contrapuntal measures of the thieves ’ song are intertwined in it . Two men in black , with heavy sticks , soft black hats and black gloves , appear in the doorway at back and stride slowly into the room . Their faces are beardless , marble white , grave and benign . One stops m front of the stretcher , the other a pace to the right . From above a dim violet light illuminates their faces .</stage></p>

     <speaker>THE FIRST</speaker>
     <p><stage>Softly .</stage>Come .<stage>LILIOM starts to walk ahead of them , then stops and looks at them .</stage>The end is not as abrupt as that . Your name is still spoken . Your face is still remembered . And what you said , and what you did , and what you failed to do — these are still remembered . Remembered , too , are the manner of your glance , the ring of your voice , the clasp of your hand and how your step sounded — as long as one is left who remembers you , so long is the matter unended . Before the end there is much to be undone . Until you are quite forgotten , my son , you will not be finished with the earth — even though you are dead .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>THE SECOND</speaker>
     <p><stage>Very gently .</stage><stage>The music begins again . All three exit at back , LILIOM leading , the others following . The stage is empty and quite dark save for the candle which burns by the stretcher , on which , in the shadows , the covers are so arranged that one cannot quite be sure that a body is not still lying . The music dies out in the distance as if it had followed LILIOM and the two POLICEMEN . The candle flickers and goes out . There is a brief interval of silence and total darkness before</stage>Come .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>THE MAGISTRATE</speaker>
     <p>And that the child , too , will be without food or shelter ? Do you regret that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>As long as I wo n't be there , what 's it got to do with me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE MAGISTRATE</speaker>
     <p>Do n't try to deceive us , Andreas Zavocki . We see through you as through a pane of glass .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>If you see so much , what do you want to ask me for ? Why do n't you let me rest — in peace ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE MAGISTRATE</speaker>
     <p>First you must earn your rest .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>I want — only — to sleep .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>THE MAGISTRATE</speaker>
     <p>Your obstinacy wo n't help you . Here patience is endless as time . We can wait .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Can I ask something — I 'd like to know — if Your Honor will tell me — whether the baby will be a boy or a girl .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE MAGISTRATE</speaker>
     <p>You shall see that for yourself .</p>
    </sp>

     <p><stage>Excitedly .</stage>I 'll see the baby ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE MAGISTRATE</speaker>
     <p>When you do it wo n't be a baby any more . But we have n't reached that question yet .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>I 'll see it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE MAGISTRATE</speaker>
     <p>Again I ask you : Do you not regret that you deserted your wife and child ; that you were a bad husband , a bad father ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>A bad husband ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE MAGISTRATE</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>And a bad father ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE MAGISTRATE</speaker>
     <p>That , too .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>I could n't get work — and I could n't bear to see Julie — all the time — all the time ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE MAGISTRATE</speaker>
     <p>Weeping ! Why are you ashamed to say it ? You could n't bear to see her weeping . Why are you afraid of that word ? And why are you ashamed that you loved her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Shrugs his shoulders .</stage>Who 's ashamed ? But I could n't bear to see her — and that 's why I was bad to her . You see , it would n't do to go back to the carousel — and Ficsur came along with his talk about — that other thing — and all of a sudden it happened , I do n't know how . The police and the Jew with the pistol — and there I stood — and I 'd lost the money playing cards — and I did n't want to be put in prison .<stage>Demanding justification .</stage>Maybe I was wrong not to go out and steal when there was nothing to eat in the house ? Should I have gone out to steal for Julie ?</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE MAGISTRATE</speaker>
     <p>You beat that poor , frail girl ; you beat her because she loved you . How could you do that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>We argued with each other — she said this and I said that — and because she was right I could n't answer her — and I got mad — and the anger rose up in me — until it reached here<stage>points to his throat</stage>and then I beat her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE MAGISTRATE</speaker>
     <p>Are you sorry ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Shakes his head , but cannot utter the word “ no ” ; continues softly .</stage>When I touched her slender throat — then — if you like — you might say ——<stage>Falters , looks embarrassed at THE MAGISTRATE .</stage></p>

     <p>Thirteen years .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>THE MAGISTRATE</speaker>
     <p>Officer , you went to earth with him ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>THE FIRST</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE MAGISTRATE</speaker>
     <p>Stephan Kadar , after thirteen years of purification by fire you returned to earth to give proof that your soul had been burned clean . What good deed did you perform ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE POORLY DRESSED MAN</speaker>
     <p>When I came to the village and looked in the window of our cottage I saw my poor little orphans sleeping peacefully . But it was raining and the rain beat into the room through a hole in the roof . So I went and fixed the roof so it would n't rain in any more . My hammering woke them up and they were afraid . But their mother came in to them and comforted them . She said to them : “ Do n't cry ! It 's your poor , dear father hammering up there . He 's come back from the other world to fix the roof for us . ”</p>

     <p>Officer ?</p>

     <p>That 's what happened .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE MAGISTRATE</speaker>
     <p>Stephan Kadar , you have done a good deed .

     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE MAGISTRATE</speaker>
     <p>When this man first appeared before us he was as stubborn as you . But now he has purified himself and withstood the test . He has done a good deed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>What 's he done , anyhow ? Any roofer can fix a roof . It 's much harder to be a barker in an amusement park .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE MAGISTRATE</speaker>
     <p>Liliom , you shall remain for sixteen years in the crimson fire until your child is full grown . By that time your pride and your stubbornness will have been burnt out of you . And when your daughter ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>My daughter !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>When your daughter has reached the age of sixteen you will be sent for one day back to earth .</p>

     <p>Me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE MAGISTRATE</speaker>
     <p>Yes — just as you may have read in the legends of how the dead reappear on earth for a time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>I never believed them .</p>

     <p>Now you see they are true . You will go back to earth one day to show how far the purification of your soul has progressed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
     <p>Then I must show what I can do — like when you apply for a job — as a coachman ?</p>

     <p>Yes — it is a test .</p>

     <p>How will I know , then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE MAGISTRATE</speaker>
     <p>You must decide that for yourself . That 's what you burn sixteen years for . And if you do something good , something splendid for your child , then ——</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE MAGISTRATE</speaker>
     <p>Now I 'll bid you farewell , Liliom . Sixteen years and a day shall pass before I see you again . When you have returned from earth you will come up before me again . Take heed and think well of some good deed to do for your child . On that will depend which door shall be opened to you up here . Now go , Liliom .<stage>He exits at left .

     <p><stage>Whispers .</stage>A cigarette ?<stage>The old GUARD stares at him , goes a few paces to the left , shakes his head disapprovingly . Then his expression softens . He takes a cigarette from his pocket and , crossing to LILIOM — who has gone over to the door at right — gives him the cigarette . THE FIRST throws open the door . An intense rose-colored light streams in . The glow of it is so strong that it blinds LILIOM and he takes a step backward and bows his head and covers his eyes with his hand before he steps forward into the light .</stage></p>

      <p>Nonsense ! You only imagined it , dear . The poor , hungry man has other things to think about than fooling with young girls . Sit down and eat your soup .<stage>They eat .</stage></p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOUISE</speaker>
      <p>No one knows . He went to America to work and he died there — in the hospital . Poor father , I never knew him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
      <p>He went to America ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOUISE</speaker>
      <p>Yes , before I was born .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
      <p>To America ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
      <p>Why do you ask so many questions ? Did you know him , perhaps ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
      <p><stage>Puts the plate down .</stage>Heaven knows ! I 've known so many people . Maybe I knew him , too .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
      <p>Well , if you knew him , leave him and us in peace with your questions . He went to America and died there . That 's all there is to tell .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
      <p>All right . All right . Do n't be angry with me . I did n't mean any harm .<stage>There is a pause .</stage></p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOUISE</speaker>
      <p>Did I say anything ——?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
      <p>Surely the little orphan can say that about her father .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOUISE</speaker>
      <p>My father could juggle so beautifully with three ivory balls that people used to advise him to go on the stage .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
      <p>Who told you that ?</p>

      <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
      <p>Wolf Beifeld is a long way from being all Budapest . But I do know a lot of people . Why should n't I know Wolf Beifeld ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOUISE</speaker>
      <p>He was a friend of my father .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
      <p>He was not his friend . No one was .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
      <p>You speak of your husband so sternly .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
      <p>What 's that to you ? Does n't it suit you ? I can speak of my husband any way I like . It 's nobody 's business but mine .</p>
     </sp>

      <p>Certainly , certainly — it 's your own business .<stage>Takes up his soup plate again . All three eat .</stage></p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
      <p>Ask him , if you like .</p>
     </sp>

     <sp>
      <speaker>LOUISE</speaker>
      <p>Was he really a very handsome man ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
      <p>I would n't exactly say handsome .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOUISE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Confidently .</stage>But he was an awfully good man , was n't he ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
      <p>He was n't so good , either . As far as I know he was what they called a clown , a barker in a carousel .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOUISE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Pleased .</stage>Did he tell funny jokes ?</p>

      <p>Lots of ‘ em . And he sang funny songs , too .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOUISE</speaker>
      <p>In the carousel ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
      <p>Yes — but he was something of a bully , too . He 'd fight anyone . He even hit your dear little mother .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
      <p>That 's a lie .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
      <p>It 's true .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
      <p>Are n't you ashamed to tell the child such awful things about her father ? Get out of here , you shameless liar . Eats our soup and our bread and has the impudence to slander our dead !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
      <p>I did n't mean — I ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
      <p>What right have you to tell lies to the child ? Take that plate , Louise , and let him be on his way . If he was n't such a hungry-looking beggar , I 'd put him out myself .<stage>LOUISE takes the plate out of his hand .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
      <p>So he did n't hit you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
      <p>No , never . He was always good to me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOUISE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Whispers .</stage>Did he tell funny stories , too ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
      <p>Yes , and such funny ones .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
      <p>Do n't speak to him any more . In God 's name , go .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOUISE</speaker>
      <p>In God 's name .<stage>JULIE resumes her seat at the table and eats .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

He looks furtively about him to make sure that the POLICE are not watching .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LOUISE</speaker>
      <p>What 's that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>LILIOM</speaker>
      <p>Pst ! A star !<stage>With a gesture he indicates that he has stolen it out of the sky .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>JULIE</speaker>
      <p><stage>Sternly .</stage>Do n't take anything from him . He 's probably stolen it somewhere .<stage>To LILIOM .</stage>In God 's name , be off with you .</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>LOUISE</speaker>
      <p>Yes , be off with you . Be off .<stage>She slams the gate .</stage></p>
