    <speaker>IN THE SHADOW OF THE GLEN</speaker>
    <p>A PLAY IN ONE ACT</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>SCENE</speaker>
    <p>—{ The last cottage at the head of a long glen in County Wicklow . Cottage kitchen ; turf fire on the right ; a bed near it against the wall with a body lying on it covered with a sheet . A door is at the other end of the room , with a low table near it , and stools , or wooden chairs . There are a couple of glasses on the table , and a bottle of whisky , as if for a wake , with two cups , a teapot , and a home-made cake . There is another small door near the bed . Nora Burke is moving about the room , settling a few things , and lighting candles on the table , looking now and then at the bed with an uneasy look . Some one knocks softly at the door . She takes up a stocking with money from the table and puts it in her pocket . Then she opens the door . }</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP</speaker>
    <p>{ Outside . } Good evening to you , lady of the house .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA</speaker>
    <p>Good evening , kindly stranger , it 's a wild night , God help you , to be out in the rain falling .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP I</speaker>
    <p>t is , surely , and I walking to Brittas from the Aughrim fair .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA I</speaker>
    <p>s it walking on your feet , stranger ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP O</speaker>
    <p>n my two feet , lady of the house , and when I saw the light below I thought maybe if you 'd a sup of new milk and a quiet decent corner where a man could sleep { he looks in past her and sees the dead man . } The Lord have mercy on us all !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA I</speaker>
    <p>t does n't matter anyway , stranger , come in out of the rain .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP</speaker>
    <p>{ Coming in slowly and going towards the bed . } Is it departed he is ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA I</speaker>
    <p>t is , stranger . He 's after dying on me , God forgive him , and there I am now with a hundred sheep beyond on the hills , and no turf drawn for the winter .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP</speaker>
    <p>{ Looking closely at the dead man . } It 's a queer look is on him for a man that 's dead .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA</speaker>
    <p>{ Half-humorously . } He was always queer , stranger , and I suppose them that 's queer and they living men will be queer bodies after .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP I</speaker>
    <p>s n't it a great wonder you 're letting him lie there , and he is not tidied , or laid out itself ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA</speaker>
    <p>{ Coming to the bed . } I was afeard , stranger , for he put a black curse on me this morning if I'ld touch his body the time he'ld die sudden , or let any one touch it except his sister only , and it 's ten miles away she lives in the big glen over the hill .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP</speaker>
    <p>{ Looking at her and nodding slowly . } It 's a queer story he would n't let his own wife touch him , and he dying quiet in his bed .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA H</speaker>
    <p>e was an old man , and an odd man , stranger , and it 's always up on the hills he was thinking thoughts in the dark mist . { She pulls back a bit of the sheet . } Lay your hand on him now , and tell me if it 's cold he is surely .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP I</speaker>
    <p>s it getting the curse on me you'ld be , woman of the house ? I would n't lay my hand on him for the Lough Nahanagan and it filled with gold .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA</speaker>
    <p>{ Looking uneasily at the body . } Maybe cold would be no sign of death with the like of him , for he was always cold , every day since I knew him ,— and every night , stranger ,—{ she covers up his face and comes away from the bed }; but I 'm thinking it 's dead he is surely , for he 's complaining a while back of a pain in his heart , and this morning , the time he was going off to Brittas for three days or four , he was taken with a sharp turn . Then he went into his bed and he was saying it was destroyed he was , the time the shadow was going up through the glen , and when the sun set on the bog beyond he made a great lep , and let a great cry out of him , and stiffened himself out the like of a dead sheep .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP</speaker>
    <p>{ Crosses himself . } God rest his soul .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA</speaker>
    <p>{ Pouring him out a glass of whisky . } Maybe that would do you better than the milk of the sweetest cow in County Wicklow .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP T</speaker>
    <p>he Almighty God reward you , and may it be to your good health . { He drinks . }</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA</speaker>
    <p>{ Giving him a pipe and tobacco . } I 've no pipes saving his own , stranger , but they 're sweet pipes to smoke .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP T</speaker>
    <p>hank you kindly , lady of the house .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA S</speaker>
    <p>it down now , stranger , and be taking your rest .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP</speaker>
    <p>{ Filling a pipe and looking about the room . } I 've walked a great way through the world , lady of the house , and seen great wonders , but I never seen a wake till this day with fine spirits , and good tobacco , and the best of pipes , and no one to taste them but a woman only .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA D</speaker>
    <p>id n't you hear me say it was only after dying on me he was when the sun went down , and how would I go out into the glen and tell the neighbours , and I a lone woman with no house near me ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP</speaker>
    <p>{ Drinking . } There 's no offence , lady of the house ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA N</speaker>
    <p>o offence in life , stranger . How would the like of you , passing in the dark night , know the lonesome way I was with no house near me at all ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP</speaker>
    <p>{ Sitting down . } I knew rightly . { He lights his pipe so that there is a sharp light beneath his haggard face . } And I was thinking , and I coming in through the door , that it 's many a lone woman would be afeard of the like of me in the dark night , in a place would n't be so lonesome as this place , where there are n't two living souls would see the little light you have shining from the glass .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA</speaker>
    <p>{ Slowly . } I 'm thinking many would be afeard , but I never knew what way I 'd be afeard of beggar or bishop or any man of you at all . { She looks towards the window and lowers her voice . } It 's other things than the like of you , stranger , would make a person afeard .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP</speaker>
    <p>{ Looking round with a half-shudder . } It is surely , God help us all !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA</speaker>
    <p>{ Looking at him for a moment with curiosity . } You 're saying that , stranger , as if you were easy afeard .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP</speaker>
    <p>{ Speaking mournfully . } Is it myself , lady of the house , that does be walking round in the long nights , and crossing the hills when the fog is on them , the time a little stick would seem as big as your arm , and a rabbit as big as a bay horse , and a stack of turf as big as a towering church in the city of Dublin ? If myself was easily afeard , I 'm telling you , it 's long ago I'ld have been locked into the Richmond Asylum , or maybe have run up into the back hills with nothing on me but an old shirt , and been eaten with crows the like of Patch Darcy — the Lord have mercy on him — in the year that 's gone .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA</speaker>
    <p>{ With interest . } You knew Darcy ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP W</speaker>
    <p>as n't I the last one heard his living voice in the whole world ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA T</speaker>
    <p>here were great stories of what was heard at that time , but would any one believe the things they do be saying in the glen ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP I</speaker>
    <p>t was no lie , lady of the house .... I was passing below on a dark night the like of this night , and the sheep were lying under the ditch and every one of them coughing , and choking , like an old man , with the great rain and the fog . Then I heard a thing talking — queer talk , you would n't believe at all , and you out of your dreams ,— and “ Merciful God , ” says I , “ if I begin hearing the like of that voice out of the thick mist , I 'm destroyed surely . ” Then I run , and I run , and I run , till I was below in Rathvanna . I got drunk that night , I got drunk in the morning , and drunk the day after ,— I was coming from the races beyond — and the third day they found Darcy .... Then I knew it was himself I was after hearing , and I was n't afeard any more .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA</speaker>
    <p>{ Speaking sorrowfully and slowly . } God spare Darcy , he'ld always look in here and he passing up or passing down , and it 's very lonesome I was after him a long while { she looks over at the bed and lowers her voice , speaking very clearly ,} and then I got happy again — if it 's ever happy we are , stranger ,— for I got used to being lonesome . { A short pause ; then she stands up . }</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA W</speaker>
    <p>as there any one on the last bit of the road , stranger , and you coming from Aughrim ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP T</speaker>
    <p>here was a young man with a drift of mountain ewes , and he running after them this way and that .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA</speaker>
    <p>{ With a half-smile . } Far down , stranger ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP A</speaker>
    <p>piece only . { She fills the kettle and puts it on the fire . }</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA M</speaker>
    <p>aybe , if you 're not easy afeard , you'ld stay here a short while alone with himself .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP I</speaker>
    <p>would surely . A man that 's dead can do no hurt .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA</speaker>
    <p>{ Speaking with a sort of constraint . } I 'm going a little back to the west , stranger , for himself would go there one night and another and whistle at that place , and then the young man you 're after seeing — a kind of a farmer has come up from the sea to live in a cottage beyond — would walk round to see if there was a thing we'ld have to be done , and I 'm wanting him this night , the way he can go down into the glen when the sun goes up and tell the people that himself is dead .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP</speaker>
    <p>{ Looking at the body in the sheet . } It 's myself will go for him , lady of the house , and let you not be destroying yourself with the great rain .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA Y</speaker>
    <p>ou would n't find your way , stranger , for there 's a small path only , and it running up between two sluigs where an ass and cart would be drowned . { She puts a shawl over her head . } Let you be making yourself easy , and saying a prayer for his soul , and it 's not long I 'll be coming again .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP</speaker>
    <p>{ Moving uneasily . } Maybe if you 'd a piece of a grey thread and a sharp needle — there 's great safety in a needle , lady of the house — I'ld be putting a little stitch here and there in my old coat , the time I 'll be praying for his soul , and it going up naked to the saints of God .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA</speaker>
    <p>{ Takes a needle and thread from the front of her dress and gives it to him . } There 's the needle , stranger , and I 'm thinking you wo n't be lonesome , and you used to the back hills , for is n't a dead man itself more company than to be sitting alone , and hearing the winds crying , and you not knowing on what thing your mind would stay ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP</speaker>
    <p>{ Slowly . } It 's true , surely , and the Lord have mercy on us all ! { Nora goes out . The Tramp begins stitching one of the tags in his coat , saying the “ De Profundis ” under his breath . In an instant the sheet is drawn slowly down , and Dan Burke looks out . The Tramp moves uneasily , then looks up , and springs to his feet with a movement of terror . }</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>DAN</speaker>
    <p>{ With a hoarse voice . } Do n't be afeard , stranger ; a man that 's dead can do no hurt .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP</speaker>
    <p>{ Trembling . } I meant no harm , your honour ; and wo n't you leave me easy to be saying a little prayer for your soul ? { A long whistle is heard outside . }</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>DAN</speaker>
    <p>{ Sitting up in his bed and speaking fiercely . } Ah , the devil mend her .... Do you hear that , stranger ? Did ever you hear another woman could whistle the like of that with two fingers in her mouth ? { He looks at the table hurriedly . } I 'm destroyed with the drouth , and let you bring me a drop quickly before herself will come back .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP</speaker>
    <p>{ Doubtfully . } Is it not dead you are ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>DAN H</speaker>
    <p>ow would I be dead , and I as dry as a baked bone , stranger ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP</speaker>
    <p>{ Pouring out the whisky . } What will herself say if she smells the stuff on you , for I 'm thinking it 's not for nothing you 're letting on to be dead ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>DAN I</speaker>
    <p>t is not , stranger , but she wo n't be coming near me at all , and it 's not long now I 'll be letting on , for I 've a cramp in my back , and my hip 's asleep on me , and there 's been the devil 's own fly itching my nose . It 's near dead I was wanting to sneeze , and you blathering about the rain , and Darcy { bitterly }— the devil choke him — and the towering church . { Crying out impatiently . } Give me that whisky . Would you have herself come back before I taste a drop at all ? { Tramp gives him the glass . }</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>DAN</speaker>
    <p>{ After drinking . } Go over now to that cupboard , and bring me a black stick you 'll see in the west corner by the wall .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP</speaker>
    <p>{ Taking a stick from the cupboard } Is it that ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>DAN I</speaker>
    <p>t is , stranger ; it 's a long time I 'm keeping that stick for I 've a bad wife in the house .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP</speaker>
    <p>{ With a queer look . } Is it herself , master of the house , and she a grand woman to talk ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>DAN I</speaker>
    <p>t 's herself , surely , it 's a bad wife she is — a bad wife for an old man , and I 'm getting old , God help me , though I 've an arm to me still . { He takes the stick in his hand . } Let you wait now a short while , and it 's a great sight you 'll see in this room in two hours or three . { He stops to listen . } Is that somebody above ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP</speaker>
    <p>{ Listening . } There 's a voice speaking on the path .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>DAN P</speaker>
    <p>ut that stick here in the bed and smooth the sheet the way it was lying . { He covers himself up hastily . } Be falling to sleep now and do n't let on you know anything , or I 'll be having your life . I would n't have told you at all but it 's destroyed with the drouth I was .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP</speaker>
    <p>{ Covering his head . } Have no fear , master of the house . What is it I know of the like of you that I'ld be saying a word or putting out my hand to stay you at all ? { He goes back to the fire , sits down on a stool with his back to the bed and goes on stitching his coat . }</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>DAN</speaker>
    <p>{ Under the sheet , querulously . } Stranger .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP</speaker>
    <p>{ Quickly . } Whisht , whisht . Be quiet I 'm telling you , they 're coming now at the door . { Nora comes in with Micheal Dara , a tall , innocent young man behind her . }</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA I</speaker>
    <p>was n't long at all , stranger , for I met himself on the path .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP Y</speaker>
    <p>ou were middling long , lady of the house .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA T</speaker>
    <p>here was no sign from himself ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP N</speaker>
    <p>o sign at all , lady of the house .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA</speaker>
    <p>{ To Micheal . } Go over now and pull down the sheet , and look on himself , Micheal Dara , and you 'll see it 's the truth I 'm telling you .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MICHEAL I</speaker>
    <p>will not , Nora , I do be afeard of the dead . { He sits down on a stool next the table facing the tramp . Nora puts the kettle on a lower hook of the pot hooks , and piles turf under it . }</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA</speaker>
    <p>{ Turning to Tramp . } Will you drink a sup of tea with myself and the young man , stranger , or { speaking more persuasively } will you go into the little room and stretch yourself a short while on the bed , I 'm thinking it 's destroyed you are walking the length of that way in the great rain .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP I</speaker>
    <p>s it to go away and leave you , and you having a wake , lady of the house ? I will not surely . { He takes a drink from his glass which he has beside him . } And it 's none of your tea I 'm asking either . { He goes on stitching . Nora makes the tea . }</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MICHEAL</speaker>
    <p>{ After looking at the tramp rather scornfully for a moment . } That 's a poor coat you have , God help you , and I 'm thinking it 's a poor tailor you are with it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP I</speaker>
    <p>f it 's a poor tailor I am , I 'm thinking it 's a poor herd does be running back and forward after a little handful of ewes the way I seen yourself running this day , young fellow , and you coming from the fair . { Nora comes back to the table . }</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>{ To Micheal in a low voice . } Let you not mind him at all , Micheal</l>
     <l>Dara , he has a drop taken and it 's soon he 'll be falling asleep .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MICHEAL I</speaker>
    <p>t 's no lie he 's telling , I was destroyed surely . They were that wilful they were running off into one man 's bit of oats , and another man 's bit of hay , and tumbling into the red bogs till it 's more like a pack of old goats than sheep they were . Mountain ewes is a queer breed , Nora Burke , and I 'm not used to them at all .</p>
   </sp>

    <p>{ Settling the tea things . } There 's no one can drive a mountain ewe but the men do be reared in the Glen Malure , I 've heard them say , and above by Rathvanna , and the Glen Imaal , men the like of Patch Darcy , God spare his soul , who would walk through five hundred sheep and miss one of them , and he not reckoning them at all .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MICHEAL</speaker>
    <p>{ Uneasily . } Is it the man went queer in his head the year that 's gone ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA I</speaker>
    <p>t is surely .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP</speaker>
    <p>{ Plaintively . } That was a great man , young fellow , a great man I 'm telling you . There was never a lamb from his own ewes he would n't know before it was marked , and he'ld run from this to the city of Dublin and never catch for his breath .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA</speaker>
    <p>{ Turning round quickly . } He was a great man surely , stranger , and is n't it a grand thing when you hear a living man saying a good word of a dead man , and he mad dying ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP I</speaker>
    <p>t 's the truth I 'm saying , God spare his soul . { He puts the needle under the collar of his coat , and settles himself to sleep in the chimney-corner . Nora sits down at the table ; their backs are turned to the bed . }</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MICHEAL</speaker>
    <p>{ Looking at her with a queer look . } I heard tell this day , Nora Burke , that it was on the path below Patch Darcy would be passing up and passing down , and I heard them say he'ld never past it night or morning without speaking with yourself .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA</speaker>
    <p>{ In a low voice . } It was no lie you heard , Micheal Dara .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MICHEAL I ’</speaker>
    <p>m thinking it 's a power of men you 're after knowing if it 's in a lonesome place you live itself .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA</speaker>
    <p>{ Giving him his tea . } It 's in a lonesome place you do have to be talking with some one , and looking for some one , in the evening of the day , and if it 's a power of men I 'm after knowing they were fine men , for I was a hard child to please , and a hard girl to please { she looks at him a little sternly }, and it 's a hard woman I am to please this day , Micheal Dara , and it 's no lie I 'm telling you .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MICHEAL</speaker>
    <p>{ Looking over to see that the tramp is asleep , and then pointing to the dead man . } Was it a hard woman to please you were when you took himself for your man ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA W</speaker>
    <p>hat way would I live and I an old woman if I did n't marry a man with a bit of a farm , and cows on it , and sheep on the back hills ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MICHEAL</speaker>
    <p>{ Considering . } That 's true , Nora , and maybe it 's no fool you were , for there 's good grazing on it , if it is a lonesome place , and I 'm thinking it 's a good sum he 's left behind . 28</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA</speaker>
    <p>{ Taking the stocking with money from her pocket , and putting it on the table . } I do be thinking in the long nights it was a big fool I was that time , Micheal Dara , for what good is a bit of a farm with cows on it , and sheep on the back hills , when you do be sitting looking out from a door the like of that door , and seeing nothing but the mists rolling down the bog , and the mists again , and they rolling up the bog , and hearing nothing but the wind crying out in the bits of broken trees were left from the great storm , and the streams roaring with the rain .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MICHEAL</speaker>
    <p>{ Looking at her uneasily . } What is it ails you , this night , Nora Burke ? I 've heard tell it 's the like of that talk you do hear from men , and they after being a great while on the back hills .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA</speaker>
    <p>{ Putting out the money on the table . } It 's a bad night , and a wild night , Micheal Dara , and is n't it a great while I am at the foot of the back hills , sitting up here boiling food for himself , and food for the brood sow , and baking a cake when the night falls ? { She puts up the money , listlessly , in little piles on the table . } Is n't it a long while I am sitting here in the winter and the summer , and the fine spring , with the young growing behind me and the old passing , saying to myself one time , to look on Mary Brien who was n't that height { holding out her hand }, and I a fine girl growing up , and there she is now with two children , and another coming on her in three months or four . { She pauses . }</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MICHEAL</speaker>
    <p>{ Moving over three of the piles . } That 's three pounds we have now , Nora Burke .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA</speaker>
    <p>{ Continuing in the same voice . } And saying to myself another time , to look on Peggy Cavanagh , who had the lightest hand at milking a cow that would n't be easy , or turning a cake , and there she is now walking round on the roads , or sitting in a dirty old house , with no teeth in her mouth , and no sense and no more hair than you'ld see on a bit of a hill and they after burning the furze from it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MICHEAL T</speaker>
    <p>hat 's five pounds and ten notes , a good sum , surely !... It 's not that way you 'll be talking when you marry a young man , Nora Burke , and they were saying in the fair my lambs were the best lambs , and I got a grand price , for I 'm no fool now at making a bargain when my lambs are good .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA W</speaker>
    <p>hat was it you got ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MICHEAL T</speaker>
    <p>wenty pound for the lot , Nora Burke .... We'ld do right to wait now till himself will be quiet awhile in the Seven Churches , and then you 'll marry me in the chapel of Rathvanna , and I 'll bring the sheep up on the bit of a hill you have on the back mountain , and we wo n't have anything we'ld be afeard to let our minds on when the mist is down .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA</speaker>
    <p>{ Pouring him out some whisky . } Why would I marry you , Mike Dara ? You 'll be getting old and I 'll be getting old , and in a little while I 'm telling you , you 'll be sitting up in your bed — the way himself was sitting — with a shake in your face , and your teeth falling , and the white hair sticking out round you like an old bush where sheep do be leaping a gap . { Dan Burke sits up noiselessly from under the sheet , with his hand to his face . His white hair is sticking out round his head . }</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA</speaker>
    <p>{ Goes on slowly without hearing him . } It 's a pitiful thing to be getting old , but it 's a queer thing surely . It 's a queer thing to see an old man sitting up there in his bed with no teeth in him , and a rough word in his mouth , and his chin the way it would take the bark from the edge of an oak board you'ld have building a door .... God forgive me , Micheal Dara , we 'll all be getting old , but it 's a queer thing surely .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MICHEAL I</speaker>
    <p>t 's too lonesome you are from living a long time with an old man , Nora , and you 're talking again like a herd that would be coming down from the thick mist { he puts his arm round her }, but it 's a fine life you 'll have now with a young man , a fine life surely .... { Dan sneezes violently . Micheal tries to get to the door , but before he can do so , Dan jumps out of the bed in queer white clothes , with his stick in his hand , and goes over and puts his back against it . }</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MICHEAL S</speaker>
    <p>on of God deliver us . { Crosses himself , and goes backward across the room . }</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>DAN</speaker>
    <p>{ Holding up his hand at him . } Now you 'll not marry her the time I 'm rotting below in the Seven Churches , and you 'll see the thing I 'll give you will follow you on the back mountains when the wind is high .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MICHEAL</speaker>
    <p>{ To Nora . } Get me out of it , Nora , for the love of God . He always did what you bid him , and I 'm thinking he would do it now .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA</speaker>
    <p>{ Looking at the Tramp . } Is it dead he is or living ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>DAN</speaker>
    <p>{ Turning towards her . } It 's little you care if it 's dead or living I am , but there 'll be an end now of your fine times , and all the talk you have of young men and old men , and of the mist coming up or going down . { He opens the door . } You 'll walk out now from that door , Nora Burke , and it 's not to-morrow , or the next day , or any day of your life , that you 'll put in your foot through it again .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP</speaker>
    <p>{ Standing up . } It 's a hard thing you 're saying for an old man , master of the house , and what would the like of her do if you put her out on the roads ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>DAN L</speaker>
    <p>et her walk round the like of Peggy Cavanagh below , and be begging money at the cross-road , or selling songs to the men . { To Nora . } Walk out now , Nora Burke , and it 's soon you 'll be getting old with that life , I 'm telling you ; it 's soon your teeth 'll be falling and your head 'll be the like of a bush where sheep do be leaping a gap . { He pauses : she looks round at Micheal . }</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MICHEAL</speaker>
    <p>{ Timidly . } There 's a fine Union below in Rathdrum .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>DAN T</speaker>
    <p>he like of her would never go there .... It 's lonesome roads she 'll be going and hiding herself away till the end will come , and they find her stretched like a dead sheep with the frost on her , or the big spiders , maybe , and they putting their webs on her , in the butt of a ditch .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA</speaker>
    <p>{ Angrily . } What way will yourself be that day , Daniel Burke ? What way will you be that day and you lying down a long while in your grave ? For it 's bad you are living , and it 's bad you 'll be when you 're dead . { She looks at him a moment fiercely , then half turns away and speaks plaintively again . } Yet , if it is itself , Daniel Burke , who can help it at all , and let you be getting up into your bed , and not be taking your death with the wind blowing on you , and the rain with it , and you half in your skin .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>DAN I</speaker>
    <p>t 's proud and happy you'ld be if I was getting my death the day I was shut of yourself . { Pointing to the door . } Let you walk out through that door , I 'm telling you , and let you not be passing this way if it 's hungry you are , or wanting a bed .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP</speaker>
    <p>{ Pointing to Micheal . } Maybe himself would take her .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA W</speaker>
    <p>hat would he do with me now ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP G</speaker>
    <p>ive you the half of a dry bed , and good food in your mouth .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>DAN I</speaker>
    <p>s it a fool you think him , stranger , or is it a fool you were born yourself ? Let her walk out of that door , and let you go along with her , stranger — if it 's raining itself — for it 's too much talk you have surely .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP</speaker>
    <p>{ Going over to Nora . } We 'll be going now , lady of the house — the rain is falling , but the air is kind and maybe it 'll be a grand morning by the grace of God .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA W</speaker>
    <p>hat good is a grand morning when I 'm destroyed surely , and I going out to get my death walking the roads ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP Y</speaker>
    <p>ou 'll not be getting your death with myself , lady of the house , and I knowing all the ways a man can put food in his mouth .... We 'll be going now , I 'm telling you , and the time you 'll be feeling the cold , and the frost , and the great rain , and the sun again , and the south wind blowing in the glens , you 'll not be sitting up on a wet ditch , the way you 're after sitting in the place , making yourself old with looking on each day , and it passing you by . You 'll be saying one time , “ It 's a grand evening , by the grace of God , ” and another time , “ It 's a wild night , God help us , but it 'll pass surely . ” You 'll be saying —</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>DAN</speaker>
    <p>{ Goes over to them crying out impatiently . } Go out of that door , I 'm telling you , and do your blathering below in the glen . { Nora gathers a few things into her shawl . }</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>TRAMP</speaker>
    <p>{ At the door . } Come along with me now , lady of the house , and it 's not my blather you 'll be hearing only , but you 'll be hearing the herons crying out over the black lakes , and you 'll be hearing the grouse and the owls with them , and the larks and the big thrushes when the days are warm , and it 's not from the like of them you 'll be hearing a talk of getting old like Peggy Cavanagh , and losing the hair off you , and the light of your eyes , but it 's fine songs you 'll be hearing when the sun goes up , and there 'll be no old fellow wheezing , the like of a sick sheep , close to your ear .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>NORA I ’</speaker>
    <p>m thinking it 's myself will be wheezing that time with lying down under the Heavens when the night is cold ; but you 've a fine bit of talk , stranger , and it 's with yourself I 'll go . { She goes towards the door , then turns to Dan . } You think it 's a grand thing you 're after doing with your letting on to be dead , but what is it at all ? What way would a woman live in a lonesome place the like of this place , and she not making a talk with the men passing ? And what way will yourself live from this day , with none to care for you ? What is it you 'll have now but a black life , Daniel Burke , and it 's not long I 'm telling you , till you 'll be lying again under that sheet , and you dead surely . { She goes out with the Tramp . Micheal is slinking after them , but Dan stops him . }</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>DAN S</speaker>
    <p>it down now and take a little taste of the stuff , Micheal Dara . There 's a great drouth on me , and the night is young .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>MICHEAL</speaker>
    <p>{ Coming back to the table . } And it 's very dry I am , surely , with the fear of death you put on me , and I after driving mountain ewes since the turn of the day .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>DAN</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>{ Throwing away his stick . } I was thinking to strike you , Micheal</l>
     <l>Dara , but you 're a quiet man , God help you , and I do n't mind you at all .</l>
     <l>{ He pours out two glasses of whisky , and gives one to Micheal . }</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>DAN Y</speaker>
    <p>our good health , Micheal Dara .</p>
   </sp>

    <speaker>MICHEAL G</speaker>
    <p>od reward you , Daniel Burke , and may you have a long life , and a quiet life , and good health with it . { They drink . }</p>
