     <head type="scene">Act One : Scene One</head>
     <stage type="setting">
      <stage>The kitchen of the Carmody home on the outskirts of a manufacturing town in Connecticut . On the left , forward , the sink . Farther back , two windows looking out on the yard . In the left corner , rear , the icebox . Immediately to the right of it , in the rear wall , a window opening on the side porch . To the right of this , a china cupboard , and a door leading into the hall where the main front entrance to the house and the stairs to the floor above are situated . On the right , to the rear , a door opening on to the dining room . Further forward , the kitchen range with scuttle , wood box , etc . In the centre of the room , a table with a red and white cloth . Four cane-bottomed chairs are pushed under the table . In front of the stove , two battered wicker rocking chairs . The floor is partly covered by linoleum strips . The walls are papered a light cheerful colour . Several old framed picture-supplement prints hang from nails . Everything has a clean , neatly-kept appearance . The supper dishes are piled in the sink ready for washing . A saucepan of water simmers on the stove .</stage>
      <stage>It is about eight o'clock in the evening of a bitter cold day in late February of the year 1912 .</stage>
      <stage>As the curtain rises , Bill Carmody is discovered fitting in a rocker by the stove , reading a newspaper and smoking a blackened clay pipe . He is a man of fifty , heavy-set and round-shouldered , with long muscular arms and swollen-veined , hairy hands . His face is bony and ponderous ; his nose short and squat ; his mouth large , thick-lipped and harsh ; his complexion mottled — red , purple-streaked , and freckled ; his hair , short and stubby with a bald spot on the crown . The expression of his small , blue eyes is one of selfish cunning . His voice is loud and hoarse . He wears a flannel shirt , open at the neck , criss-crossed by red braces ; black , baggy trousers grey with dust ; muddy brogues .</stage>
      <stage>His youngest daughter , Mary , is sitting on a chair by the table , front , turning over the pages of a picture book . She is a delicate , dark-haired , blue-eyed , quiet little girl about eight years old .</stage>
     </stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>after watching the child 's preoccupation for a moment , in a tone of half exasperated amusement</stage>Well , but you 're the quiet one , surely !<stage>Mary looks up at him with a shy smile , her eyes still full of dreams .</stage>Glory be to God , I 'd not know a soul was alive in the room , barrin ’ myself . What is it you 're at , Mary , that there 's not a word out of you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>I 'm looking at the pictures .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p>It 's the dead spit and image of your sister Eileen you are , with your nose always in a book ; and you 're like your mother , too , God rest her soul .<stage>He crosses himself with pious unction and Mary also does so .</stage>It 's Nora and Tom has the high spirits in them like their father ; and Billy , too ,— if he is a lazy , shiftless divil — has the fightin ’ Carmody blood like me . You 're a Cullen like your mother 's people . They always was dreamin ’ their lives out .<stage>He lights his pipe and shakes his head with ponderous gravity .</stage>There 's no good in too many books , I 'll tell you . It 's out rompin ’ and playin ’ with your brother and sister you ought to be at your age , not carin ’ a fig for books .<stage>With a glance at the clock .</stage>Is that auld fool of a doctor stayin ’ the night ? If he had his wits about him he 'd know in a jiffy ‘ tis only a cold has taken Eileen , and give her the medicine . Run out in the hall , Mary , and see if you hear him . He may have sneaked away by the front door .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>goes out into the hall , rear , and comes back</stage>He 's upstairs . I heard him talking to Eileen .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p>Close the door , ye little divil ! There 's a freezin ’ draught comin ’ in .<stage>She does so and comes back to her chair . Carmody continues with a sneer .</stage>It 's mad I am to be thinkin ’ he 'd go without gettin ’ his money — the like of a doctor !<stage>Angrily .</stage>Rogues and thieves they are , the lot of them , robbin ’ the poor like us ! I 've no use for their drugs at all . They only keep you sick to pay more visits . I 'd not have sent for this bucko if Eileen did n't scare me by faintin ’ .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>anxiously</stage>Is Eileen very sick , Papa ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>spitting — roughly</stage>If she is , it 's her own fault entirely — weakenin ’ her health by readin ’ here in the house . This 'll be a lesson for her , and for you , too .<stage>Irritably .</stage>Put down that book on the table and leave it be . I 'll have no more readin ’ in this house , or I 'll take the strap to you !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>laying the book on the table</stage>It 's only pictures .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p>No back talk ! Pictures or not , it 's all the same mopin ’ and lazin ’ in it .<stage>After a pause — morosely .</stage>It 's the bad luck I 've been havin ’ altogether this last year since your mother died . Who 's to do the work and look after Nora and Tom and yourself , if Eileen is bad took and has to stay in her bed ? I 'll have to get Mrs. Brennan come look after the house . That means money , too , and where 's it to come from ? All that I 've saved from slavin ’ and sweatin ’ in the sun with a gang of lazy Dagoes 'll be up the spout in no time .<stage>Bitterly .</stage>What a fool a man is to be raisin ’ a raft of children and him not a millionaire !<stage>With lugubrious self-pity .</stage>Mary , dear , it 's a black curse God put on me when he took your mother just when I needed her most .<stage>Mary commences to sob . Carmody starts and looks at her angrily .</stage>What are you sniffin ’ at ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p><stage>tearfully</stage>I was thinking — of Mamma .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>scornfully</stage>It 's late you are with your tears , and her cold in her grave for a year . Stop it , I 'm tellin ’ you !<stage>Mary gulps back her sobs .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <stage>There is a noise of childish laughter and screams from the street in front . The outside door is opened and slammed , footsteps pound along the hall . The door in the rear is pushed open , and Nora and Tom rush in breathlessly . Nora is a bright , vivacious , red-haired girl of eleven — pretty after an elfish , mischievous fashion — light-hearted and robust .</stage>
     <stage>Tom resembles Nora in disposition and appearance . A healthy , good-humoured youngster with a shock of sandy hair . He is a year younger than Nora . They are followed into the room , a moment later , by their brother Billy , who is evidently loftily disgusted with their antics . Billy is a fourteen-year-old replica of his father , whom he imitates even to the hoarse , domineering tone of voice .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>grumpily</stage>Ah , here you are , the lot of you . Shut that door after you ! What 's the use in me spendin ’ money for coal if all you do is to let the cold night in the room itself ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORA</speaker>
      <p><stage>hopping over to him — teasingly</stage>Me and Tom had a race , Papa . I beat him .<stage>She sticks her tongue out at her younger brother .</stage>Slow poke !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TOM</speaker>
      <p>You did n't beat me , neither !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORA</speaker>
      <p>I did , too !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TOM</speaker>
      <p>You did not ! You did n't play fair . You tripped me comin ’ up the steps . Brick-top ! Cheater !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORA</speaker>
      <p><stage>flaring up</stage>You 're a liar ! You stumbled over your own big feet , clumsy bones ! And I beat you fair Did n't I , Papa ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a grin</stage>You did , darlin ’ , and fair , too .<stage>Tom slinks back to the chair in the rear of table , sulking . Carmody pats Nora 's red hair with delighted pride .</stage>Sure it 's you can beat the divil himself !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORA</speaker>
      <p><stage>sticks out her tongue again at Tom</stage>See ? Liar !<stage>She goes and perches on the table near Mary , who is staring sadly in front of her .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>to Billy — irritably</stage>Did you get the plug for me I told you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BILLY</speaker>
      <p>Sure .<stage>He takes a plug of tobacco from his pocket and hands it to his father . Nora slides down off her perch and disappears , unnoticed , under the table .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p>It 's a great wonder you did n't forget it — and me without a chew .<stage>He bites off a piece and tucks it into his cheek .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TOM</speaker>
      <p><stage>suddenly clutching at his leg with a yell</stage>Ouch ! Darn you !<stage>He kicks frantically at something under the table , but Nora scrambles out at the other end , grinning .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>angrily</stage>Shut your big mouth ! What is the matter with you at all ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TOM</speaker>
      <p><stage>indignantly</stage>She pinched me — hard as she could , too — and look at her laughin ’ !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORA</speaker>
      <p><stage>hopping on the table again</stage>Cry-baby ! I owed you one .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TOM</speaker>
      <p>I 'll fix you . I 'll tell Eileen , wait ‘ n ’ see !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORA</speaker>
      <p>Tattle-tale ! I do n't care . Eileen 's sick .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>TOM</speaker>
      <p>That 's why you dast do it . You das n't if she was up . I 'll get even , you bet !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>exasperated</stage>Shut up your noise ! Go up to bed , the two of you , and no more talk , and you go with them , Mary .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORA</speaker>
      <p><stage>giving a quick tug at Mary 's hair</stage>Come on , Mary . Wake up .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARY</speaker>
      <p>Ow !<stage>She begins to cry .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>raising his voice furiously</stage>Hush your noise , you soft , weak thing , you ! It 's nothin ’ but blubberin ’ you do be doin ’ all the time .<stage>He stands up threateningly .</stage>I 'll have a moment 's peace , I will ! Off to bed with you before I get the strap ! It 's crazy mad you all get the moment Eileen 's away from you . Go on , now !<stage>They scurry out of the rear door .</stage>And be quiet or I 'll be up to you !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NORA</speaker>
      <p><stage>sticks her head back in the door</stage>Can I say good-night to Eileen , Papa ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p>No . The doctor 's with her yet .<stage>Then he adds hastily .</stage>Yes , go in to her , Nora . It 'll drive himself out of the house maybe , bad cess to him , and him stayin ’ half the night .<stage>Nora waits to hear no more but darts back , shutting the door behind her . Billy takes the chair in front of the table . Carmody sits down again with a groan .</stage>The rheumatics are in my leg again .<stage>Shakes his head .</stage>If Eileen 's in bed long those brats 'll have the house down .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BILLY</speaker>
      <p>Eileen ai n't sick very bad , is she ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>easily</stage>It 's a cold only she has .<stage>Then mournfully .</stage>Your poor mother died of the same .<stage>Billy looks awed .</stage>Ara , well , it 's God 's will , I suppose , but where the money 'll come from , I dunno .<stage>With a disparaging glance at his son .</stage>They 'll not be raisin ’ your wages soon , I 'll be bound .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BILLY</speaker>
      <p><stage>surlily</stage>Naw . The old boss never gives no one a raise , ‘ less he has to . He 's a tight-wad for fair .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>still scanning him with contempt</stage>Five dollars a week — for a strappin ’ lad the like of you ! It 's shamed you should be to own up to it . A divil of a lot of good it was for me to go against Eileen 's wish and let you leave off your schoolin ’ this year like you wanted , thinkin ’ the money you 'd earn at work would help with the house .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BILLY</speaker>
      <p>Aw , goin ’ to school did n't do me no good . The teachers was all down on me . I could n't learn nothin ’ there .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>disgustedly</stage>Nor any other place , I 'm thinkin ’ , you 're that thick ,<stage>There is a noise from the stairs in the hall .</stage>Whisht ! It 's the doctor comin ’ down from Eileen . What 'll he say , I wonder ?<stage>The door in the rear is opened and Doctor Gaynor enters . He is a stout , bald , middle-aged man , forceful of speech , who in the case of patients of the Carmodys ’ class dictates rather than advises . Carmody adopts a whining tone .</stage>Aw , Doctor , and how 's Eileen now ? Have you got her cured of the weakness ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GAYNOR</speaker>
      <p><stage>does not answer this but comes forward into the room holding out two slips of paper — dictatorially</stage>Here are two prescriptions that 'll have to be filled immediately .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>frowning</stage>You take them , Billy , and run round to the drug store .<stage>Gaynor hands them to Billy .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BILLY</speaker>
      <p>Give me the money , then .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>reaches down into his trousers pocket with a sigh</stage>How much will they come to , Doctor ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GAYNOR</speaker>
      <p>About a dollar , I guess .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>protestingly</stage>A dollar ! Sure it 's expensive medicines you 're givin ’ her for a bit of a cold .<stage>He meets the doctor 's cold glance of contempt and he wilts — grumblingly , as he peels a dollar bill off a small roll and gives it to Billy .</stage>Bring back the change — if there is any . And none of your tricks , for I 'll stop at the drug store myself to-morrow and ask the man how much it was .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GAYNOR</speaker>
      <p>There 's no chance for a mistake , I 'm sorry to say . Her right lung is badly affected .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GAYNOR</speaker>
      <p>No , your kind never realises things till the crash comes — usually when it 's too late . She kept on doing her work , I suppose — taking care of her brothers and sisters , washing , cooking , sweeping , looking after your comfort — worn out — when she should have been in bed — and ——<stage>He gets to his feet with a harsh laugh .</stage>But what 's the use of talking ? The damage is done . We 've got to set to work to repair it at once . I 'll write to-night to Dr. Stanton of the Hill Farm Sanatorium and find out if he has a vacancy . And if luck is with us we can send her there at once . The sooner the better .</p>

You 'll get that notion out of your head damn quick . It 's all nonsense you 're stuffin ’ me with , and lies , makin ’ things out to be the worst in the world . I 'll not believe a word of Eileen having the consumption at all . It 's doctors ’ notions to be always lookin ’ for a sickness that 'd kill you .

     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>thoroughly frightened , but still protesting</stage>Ara , Doctor , you do n't see the way of it at all . If Eileen goes to the hospital , who 's to be takin ’ care of the others , and mindin ’ the house when I 'm off to work ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GAYNOR</speaker>
      <p><stage>brutally</stage>That 's your concern . Do n't lie about your poverty . You 've a steady well-paid job , and plenty of money to throw away on drunken sprees , I 'll bet . The weekly fee at the Hill Farm is only seven dollars . You can easily afford that — the price of a few rounds of drinks .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p>Seven dollars ! And I 'll have to pay a woman to come in — and the four of the children eatin ’ their heads off ! Glory be to God , I 'll not have a penny saved for me old age — and then it 's the poor-house !</p>

      <p>Ah , doctor , it 's the truth I 'm tellin ’ you !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GAYNOR</speaker>
      <p>Well , perhaps I can get the Society to pay half for your daughter — if you 're really as hard up as you pretend . They 're willing to do that where it seems necessary .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>brightening</stage>Ah , Doctor , thank you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p><stage>abruptly</stage>Then it 's all settled ?</p>

      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>grudgingly — trying to make the best of it</stage>I 'll do my best for Eileen , if it 's needful — and you 'll not be tellin ’ them people about it at all , Doctor ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GAYNOR</speaker>
      <p>Not unless you force me to .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p>And they 'll pay the half , surely ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GAYNOR</speaker>
      <p>I 'll see what I can do — for your daughter 's sake , not yours , understand !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p>God bless you , Doctor !<stage>Grumblingly .</stage>It 's the whole of it they ought to be payin ’ , I 'm thinkin ’ , and them with bags of money . ‘ Tis them builds the hospitals and why should they be wantin ’ the poor like me to support them ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GAYNOR</speaker>
      <p><stage>disgustedly</stage>Bah !<stage>Abruptly .</stage>I 'll telephone to Doctor Stanton to-morrow morning . Then I 'll know something definite when I come to see your daughter in the afternoon .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>darkly</stage>You 'll be comin ’ again tomorrow ?<stage>Half to himself .</stage>Leave it to the likes of you to be drainin ’ a man dry .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Gaynor has gone out to the hall in rear and does not hear this last remark . There is a loud knock from the outside door . The Doctor comes back into the room carrying his hat and overcoat .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GAYNOR</speaker>
      <p>There 's someone knocking .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p>Who 'll it be ? Ah , it 's Fred Nicholls , maybe .<stage>In a low voice to Gaynor who has started to put on his overcoat .</stage>Eileen 's young man , Doctor , that she 's engaged to marry , as you might say .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GAYNOR</speaker>
      <p><stage>thoughtfully</stage>H'mm — yes — she spoke of him .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>As another knock sounds Carmody hurries to the rear . Gaynor , after a moments indecision , takes off his overcoat again and sits down . A moment later Carmody re-enters , followed by Fred Nicholls , who has left his overcoat and hat in the hallway . Nicholls is a young fellow of twenty-three , stockily built , fair-haired , handsome in a commonplace , conventional mould . His manner is obviously an attempt at suave gentility ; he has an easy , taking smile and a ready laugh , but there is a petty , calculating expression in his small , observing , blue eyes . His well-fitting , ready-made clothes are carefully pressed . His whole get-up suggests an attitude of man-about-small-town complacency .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>as they enter</stage>I had a mind to phone to your house , but I was n't wishful to disturb you , knowin ’ you 'd be comin ’ to call to-night .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>with disappointed concern</stage>It 's nothing serious , I hope .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>grumblingly</stage>Ah , who knows ? Here 's the doctor . You 've not met him ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>politely , looking at Gaynor , who inclines his head stiffly</stage>I have n't had the pleasure . Of course , I 've heard ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p>It 's Doctor Gaynor . This is Fred Nicholls , Doctor .<stage>The two men shake hands with conventional greetings .</stage>Sit down , Fred , that 's a good lad , and be talkin ’ to the Doctor a moment while I go upstairs and see how is Eileen . She 's all alone up there .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p>Certainly , Mr. Carmody . Go ahead — and tell her how sorry I am to learn she 's under the weather .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p>I will so .<stage>He goes out .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GAYNOR</speaker>
      <p><stage>after a pause in which he is studying Nicholls</stage>Do you happen to be any relative to the Albert Nicholls who is superintendent over at the Downs Manufacturing Company ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>smiling</stage>He 's sort of a near relative — my father .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GAYNOR</speaker>
      <p>Ah , yes ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>with satisfaction</stage>I work for the Downs Company myself — bookkeeper ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GAYNOR</speaker>
      <p>Miss Carmody — the sick girl upstairs — she had a position there also , did n't she , before her mother died ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p>Yes . She had a job as stenographer for a time . When she graduated from the business college course — I was already working at the Downs — and through my father 's influence — you understand .<stage>Gaynor nods curtly .</stage>She was getting on finely , too , and liked the work . It 's too bad — her mother 's death , I mean — forcing her to give it up and come home to take care of those kids .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GAYNOR</speaker>
      <p>It 's a damn shame . That 's the main cause of her breakdown .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>frowning</stage>I 've noticed she 's been looking badly lately . So that 's the trouble ? Well , it 's all her father 's fault — and her own , too , because whenever I raised a kick about his making a slave of her , she always defended him .<stage>With a quick glance at the Doctor — in a confidential tone .</stage>Between us , Carmody 's as selfish as they make ‘ em , if you want my opinion .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GAYNOR</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a growl</stage>He 's a hog on two legs .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a gratified smile</stage>You bet !<stage>With a patronising air .</stage>I hope to get Eileen away from all this as soon as — things pick up a little .<stage>Making haste to explain his connection with the dubious household .</stage>Eileen and I have gone around together for years — went to Grammar and High School together — in different classes , of course . She 's really a corker — very different from the rest of the family you 've seen — like her mother . She 's really educated and knows a lot — used to carry off all the prizes at school . My folks like her awfully well . Of course , they 'd never stand for — him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GAYNOR</speaker>
      <p>You 'll excuse my curiosity — I 've a good reason for it — but you and Miss Carmody are engaged , are n't you ? Carmody said you were .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>embarrassed</stage>Why , yes , in a way — but nothing definite — no official announcement or anything of that kind . It 's all in the future . We have to wait , you know .<stage>With a sentimental smile .</stage>We 've been sort of engaged for years , you might say . It 's always been sort of understood between us .<stage>He laughs awkwardly .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GAYNOR</speaker>
      <p><stage>gravely</stage>Then I can be frank with you . I 'd like to be because I may need your help . I do n't put much faith in any promise Carmody makes . Besides , you 're bound to know anyway . She 'd tell you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>a look of apprehension coming over his face</stage>Is it — about her sickness ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GAYNOR</speaker>
      <p>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p>Then — it 's serious ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GAYNOR</speaker>
      <p>It 's pulmonary tuberculosis — consumption .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>stunned</stage>Consumption ? Good heavens !<stage>After a dazed pause — lamely .</stage>Are you sure , Doctor ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GAYNOR</speaker>
      <p>Positive .<stage>Nicholls stares at him with vaguely frightened eyes .</stage>It 's had a good start — thanks to her father 's blind selfishness — but let 's hope that can be overcome . The important thing is to ship her off to a sanatorium immediately . Carmody would n't hear of it at first . However , I managed to bully him into consenting ; but I do n't trust his word . That 's where you can be of help . It 's up to you to convince him that it 's imperative she be sent away at once — for the safety of those around her as well as her own .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>confusedly</stage>I 'll do my best , Doctor .<stage>As if he could n't yet believe his ears — shuddering !</stage>Good heavens ! She never said a word about — being so ill. She 's had a cold . But , Doctor — do you think this sanatorium will ——?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GAYNOR</speaker>
      <p><stage>with hearty hopefulness</stage>Most certainly . She has every chance . The Hill Farm has a really surprising record of arrested cases — as good as any place in the country . Of course , she 'll never be able to live as carelessly as before , even after the most favourable results . She 'll have to take care of herself .<stage>Apologetically .</stage>I 'm telling you all this as being the one most intimately concerned . I do n't count Carmody . You are the one who will have to assume responsibility for her welfare when she returns to everyday life .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>answering as if he were merely talking to screen the thoughts in his mind</stage>Yes — certainly . Where is this sanatorium , Doctor — very far away ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GAYNOR</speaker>
      <p>Half an hour by train to the town . The sanatorium is two miles out on the hills — a nice drive . You 'll be able to see her whenever you 've a day off . It 's a pleasant trip .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>a look of horrified realisation has been creeping into his eyes</stage>You said — Eileen ought to be sent away — for the sake of those around her ——?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GAYNOR</speaker>
      <p>That 's obvious . T. B . is extremely contagious , you must know that . Yet I 'll bet she 's been fondling and kissing those brothers and sisters of hers regardless .<stage>Nicholls fidgets uneasily on his chair .</stage>And look at this house sealed tight against the fresh air ! Not a window open an inch !<stage>Fuming .</stage>That 's what we 're up against in the fight with T. B .— a total ignorance of the commonest methods of prevention ——</p>

      <p><stage>his eyes shiftily avoiding the doctor 's face</stage>Then the kids might have gotten it — by kissing Eileen ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GAYNOR</speaker>
      <p>It stands to reason that 's a common means of communication .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>very much shaken</stage>Yes . I suppose it must be . But that 's terrible , is n't it ?<stage>With sudden volubility , evidently extremely anxious to wind up this conversation and conceal his thoughts from Gaynor .</stage>I 'll promise you , Doctor , I 'll tell Carmody straight what 's what . He 'll pay attention to me or I 'll know the reason why .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GAYNOR</speaker>
      <p><stage>getting to his feet and picking up his overcoat</stage>Good boy ! You 've probably saved me a disagreeable squabble . I wo n't wait for Carmody . The sight of him makes me lose my temper . Tell him I 'll be back to-morrow with definite information about the sanatorium .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>helping him on with his overcoat , anxious to have him go</stage>All right , Doctor .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GAYNOR</speaker>
      <p><stage>puts on his hat</stage>And do your best to cheer the patient up when you talk to her . Give her confidence in her ability to get well . That 's half the battle . And she 'll believe it , coming from you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>hastily</stage>Yes , yes , I 'll do all I can .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GAYNOR</speaker>
      <p><stage>turns to the door and shakes Nicholls ’ hand sympathetically</stage>And do n't take it to heart too much yourself . There 's every hope , remember that . In six months she 'll come back to you her old self again .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>nervously</stage>It 's hard on a fellow — so suddenly — but I 'll remember — and ——<stage>Abruptly</stage>Good night , Doctor .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>GAYNOR</speaker>
      <p>Good night .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He goes out . The outer door is heard shutting behind him . Nicholls closes the door , rear , and comes back and sits in the chair in front of table . He rests his chin on his hands and stares before him , a look of desperate , frightened calculation coming into his eyes . Carmody is heard clumping heavily down the stairs . A moment later he enters . His expression is glum and irritated .</stage>

      <p><stage>turning on him with a look of repulsion</stage>Yes . He told me to tell you he 'd be back to-morrow with definite information — about the sanatorium business .</p>

      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>darkly</stage>Oho , he did , did he ? Maybe I 'll surprise him . I 'm thinkin ’ it 's lyin ’ he is about Eileen 's sickness , and her lookin ’ as fresh as a daisy with the high colour in her cheeks when I saw her now .</p>

      <p><stage>impatiently</stage>That 's silly , Mr. Carmody . Gaynor knows his business .<stage>After a moment 's hesitation .</stage>He told me all about Eileen 's sickness .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>resentfully</stage>Did he now , the auld monkey ! Small thanks to him to be tellin ’ our secrets to the town .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>exasperated</stage>I did n't want to learn your affairs . He only told me because you 'd said I and Eileen were engaged . You 're the one who was telling — secrets .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>irritated</stage>Ara , do n't be talkin ’ ! That 's no secret at all with the whole town watchin ’ Eileen and you spoonin ’ together from the time you was kids .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>vindictively</stage>Well , the whole town is liable to find out ——<stage>He checks himself .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>too absorbed in his own troubles to notice this threat</stage>To hell with the town and all in it ! I 've troubles enough of my own . So he told you he 'd send Eileen away to the hospital ? I 've half a mind not to let him — and let him try to make me !<stage>With a frown .</stage>But Eileen herself says she 's wantin ’ to go , now .<stage>Angrily .</stage>It 's all that divil 's notion he put in her head that the children 'd be catchin ’ her sickness that makes her willin ’ to go .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a superior air</stage>From what he told me , I should say it was the only thing for Eileen to do if she wants to get well quickly .<stage>Spitefully .</stage>And I 'd certainly not go against Gaynor , if I was you . He told me he 'd make it hot for you if you did . He will , too , you can bet on that . He 's that kind .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>worriedly</stage>He 's a divil . But what can he do — him and his Sasiety ? I 'm her father .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>seeing Carmody 's uneasiness , with revengeful satisfaction</stage>Oh , he 'll do what he says , do n't worry ! You 'll make a mistake if you think he 's bluffing . It 'd probably get in all the papers about you refusing . Every one would be down on you .<stage>As a last jab — spitefully .</stage>You might even lose your job over it , people would be so sore .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>jumping to his feet</stage>Ah , divil take him ! Let him send her where he wants , then . I 'll not be sayin ’ a word .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>as an afterthought</stage>And , honestly , Mr. Carmody , I do n't see how you can object for a second — after he 's told you it 's absolutely necessary for Eileen to go away .<stage>Seeing Carmody 's shaken condition , he finishes boldly .</stage>You 've some feeling for your own daughter , have n't you ? You 'd be a fine father if you had n't !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>apprehensively</stage>Whisht ! She might hear you . But you 're right . Let her do what she 's wishful to , and get well soon .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>complacently — feeling his duty in the matter well done</stage>That 's the right spirit . I knew you 'd see it that way . And you and I 'll do all we can to help her .<stage>He gets to his feet .</stage>Well , I guess I 'll have to go . Tell Eileen ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p>You 're not goin ’ ? Sure , Eileen is puttin ’ on her clothes to come down and have a look at you . She 'll be here in a jiffy . Sit down now , and wait for her .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>suddenly panic-stricken by the prospect of facing her</stage>No — no — I can n't stay — I only came for a moment — I 've got an appointment — honestly . Besides , it is n't right for her to be up . She 's too weak . It 'll make her worse . You should have told her .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>The door in the rear is opened and Eileen enters . She is just over eighteen . Her wavy mass of dark hair is parted in the middle and combed low on her forehead , covering her ears , to a knot at the back of her head . The oval of her face is spoiled by a long , rather heavy Irish jaw contrasting with the delicacy of her other features . Her eyes are large and blue , confident in their compelling candour and sweetness ; her lips , full and red , half-open over strong , even teeth , droop at the corners into an expression of wistful sadness ; her clear complexion is unnaturally striking in its contrasting colours , rose and white ; her figure is slight and undeveloped . She wears a plain black dress with a bit of white at the neck and wrists . She stands looking appealingly at Nicholls , who avoids her glance . Her eyes have a startled , stunned expression as if the doctor 's verdict were still in her ears .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>faintly — forcing a smile</stage>Good evening , Fred .<stage>Her eyes search his face anxiously .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>confusedly</stage>Hello , Eileen . I 'm so sorry to ——<stage>Clumsily trying to cover up his confusion , he goes over and leads her to a chair .</stage>You must sit down . You 've got to take care of yourself . You never ought to have got up to-night .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>sits down</stage>I wanted to talk to you .<stage>She raises her face with a pitiful smile . Nicholls hurriedly moves back to his own chair .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>almost brusquely</stage>I could have talked to you from the hall . You 're silly to take chances just now .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Eileen 's eyes show her hurt at his tone .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>seeing his chance — hastily</stage>You 'll be stayin ’ a while now , Fred ? I 'll take a walk down the road . I 'm needin ’ a drink to clear my wits .<stage>He goes to the door in rear .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>reproachfully</stage>You wo n't be long , Father ? And please do n't — you know .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>exasperated</stage>Sure who would n't get drunk with all the sorrows of the world piled on him ?<stage>He stamps out . A moment later the outside door bangs behind him . Eileen sighs . Nicholls walks up and down with his eyes on the floor .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>furious at Carmody for having left him in this situation</stage>Honestly , Eileen , your father is the limit . I do n't see how you stand for him . He 's the most selfish ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>gently</stage>Sssh ! You must n't , Fred . He 's not to blame . He just does n't understand .<stage>Nicholls snorts disdainfully .</stage>Do n't ! Let 's not talk about him now . We wo n't have many more evenings together for a long , long time . Did father or the Doctor tell you ——<stage>She falters .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>not looking at her — glumly</stage>Everything there was to tell , I guess .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>hastening to comfort him</stage>You must n't worry , Fred . Please do n't ! It 'd make it so much worse for me if I thought you did . I 'll be all right . I 'll do exactly what they tell me , and in a few months I 'll be back so fat and healthy you wo n't know me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>lamely</stage>Oh , there 's no doubt of that . No one 's worrying about your not getting well quick .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>It wo n't be long . We can write often , and it is n't far away . You can come out and see me every Sunday — if you want to .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>hastily</stage>Of course I will !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>looking at his face searchingly</stage>Why do you act so funny ? Why do n't you sit down — here , by me ? Do n't you want to ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>drawing up a chair by hers — flushing guiltily</stage>I — I 'm all flustered , Eileen . I do n't know what I 'm doing .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>putting her hand on his knee</stage>Poor Fred ! I 'm so sorry I have to go . I did n't want to at first . I knew how hard it would be on father and the kids — especially little Mary .<stage>Her voice trembles a bit .</stage>And then the doctor said if I stayed I 'd be putting them all in danger . He even ordered me not to kiss them any more .<stage>She bites her lip to restrain a sob — then coughs , a soft , husky cough . Nicholls shrinks away from her to the edge of his chair , his eyes shifting nervously with fright . Eileen continues gently .</stage>So I 've got to go and get well , do n't you see ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>wetting his dry lips</stage>Yes — it 's better .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>sadly</stage>I 'll miss the kids so much . Taking care of them has meant so much to me since mother died .<stage>With a half-sob she suddenly throws her arms about his neck and hides her face on his shoulder . He shudders and fights against an impulse to push her away .</stage>But I 'll miss you most of all , Fred .<stage>She lifts her lips towards his , expecting a kiss . He seems about to kiss her — then averts his face with a shrinking movement , pretending he has n't seen . Eileen 's eyes grow wide with horror . She throws herself back into her chair , staring accusingly at Nicholls . She speaks chokingly .</stage>Fred ! Why — why did n't you kiss — what is it ? Are you — afraid ?<stage>With a moaning sound .</stage>Oooh !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>goaded by this accusation into a display of manhood , seizes her fiercely by the arms</stage>No ! What — what d'you mean ?<stage>He tries to kiss her , but she hides her face .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>in a muffled voice of hysterical self-accusation , pushing his head away</stage>No , no , you must n't ! I was wrong . The doctor told you not to , did n't he ? Please do n't , Fred ! It would be awful if anything happened to you — through me .<stage>Nicholls gives up his attempts , recalled to caution by her words . She raises her face and tries to force a smile through her tears .</stage>But you can kiss me on the forehead , Fred . That can n't do any harm .<stage>His face crimson , he does so . She laughs hysterically .</stage>It seems so silly — being kissed that way — by you .<stage>She gulps back a sob and continued to attempt to joke .</stage>I 'll have to get used to it , wo n't I ?</p>

     <stage>THE CURTAIN FALLS</stage>
    </div>
    <div type="scene" n="2">
     <head type="scene">Act One : Scene Two .</head>
     <stage type="setting">
      <stage>The reception room of the Infirmary , a large , high-ceilinged room painted white , with oiled , hard wood floor . In the left wall , forward , a row of four windows . Farther back , the main entrance from the drive , and another window . In the rear wall left , a glass partition looking out on the sleeping porch . A row of white beds , with the faces of patients barely peeping out from under piles of heavy bed-clothes , can be seen . To the right of this partition , a bookcase , and a door leading to the hall past the patients ’ rooms . Farther right , another door opening on the examining room . In the right wall , rear , a door to the office . Farther forward , a row of windows . In front of the windows , a long dining-table with chairs . On the left of the table , towards the centre of the room , a chimney with two open fire-places , facing left and right . Several wicker armchairs are placed around the fire-place on the left in which a cheerful wood fire is crackling . To the left of centre , a round reading and writing table with a green-shaded electric lamp . Other electric lights are in brackets around the walls . Easy chairs stand near the table , which is stacked with magazines . Rocking chairs are placed here and there about the room , near the windows , etc . A gramophone stands near the left wall , forward .</stage>
      <stage>It is nearing eight o'clock of a cold evening about a week later .</stage>
      <stage>At the rise of the curtain Stephen Murray is discovered sitting in a chair in front of the fireplace , left . Murray is thirty years old — a tall , slender , rather unusual-looking fellow with a pale face , sunken under high cheek bones , lined about the eyes and mouth , jaded and worn for one still so young . His intelligent , large hazel eyes have a tired , dispirited expression in repose , but can quicken instantly with a concealed mechanism of mocking , careless humour whenever his inner privacy is threatened . His large mouth aids this process of protection by a quick change from its set apathy to a cheerful grin of cynical good nature . He gives off the impression of being somehow dissatisfied with himself , but not yet embittered enough by it to take it out on others . His manner , as revealed by his speech — nervous , inquisitive , alert — seems more an acquired quality than any part of his real nature . He stoops a trifle , giving him a slightly round-shouldered appearance . He is dressed in a shabby dark suit , baggy at the knees . He is staring into the fire , dreaming , an open book lying unheeded on the arm of his chair . The gramophone is whining out the last strains of Dvorak 's Humoresque . In the doorway to the office , Miss Gilpin stands talking to Miss Howard . The former is a slight , middle-aged woman with black hair , and a strong , intelligent face , its expression of resolute efficiency softened and made kindly by her warm , sympathetic grey eyes . Miss Howard is tall , slender and blonde — decidedly pretty and provokingly conscious of it , yet with a certain air of seriousness underlying her apparent frivolity . She is twenty years old . The elder woman is dressed in the all-white of a full-fledged nurse . Miss Howard wears the grey-blue uniform of one still in training . The record finishes . Murray sighs with relief , but makes no move to get up and stop the grinding needle . Miss Howard hurries across to the machine . Miss Gilpin goes back into the office .</stage>
     </stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MISS HOWARD</speaker>
      <p><stage>takes off the record , glancing at Murray with amused vexation</stage>It 's a wonder you would n't stop this machine grinding itself to bits , Mr. Murray .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a smile</stage>I was hoping the darn thing would bust .<stage>Miss Howard sniffs . Murray grins at her teasingly .</stage>It keeps you from talking to me . That 's the real music .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MISS HOWARD</speaker>
      <p><stage>comes over to his chair laughing</stage>It 's easy to see you 've got Irish in you . Do you know what I think ? I think you 're a natural born kidder . All newspaper reporters are like that , I 've heard .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>You wrong me terribly .<stage>Then frowning .</stage>And it is n't charitable to remind me of my job . I hoped to forget all about it up here .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MISS HOWARD</speaker>
      <p><stage>surprised</stage>I think it 's great to be able to write . I wish I could . You ought to be proud of it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>glumly</stage>I 'm not . You can n't call it writing — not what I did — small town stuff .<stage>Changing the subject .</stage>But I wanted to ask you something . Do you know when I 'm to be moved away to the huts ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MISS HOWARD</speaker>
      <p>In a few days , I guess . Do n't be impatient .<stage>Murray grunts and moves nervously on his chair .</stage>What 's the matter ? Do n't you like us here at the Sanatorium ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>smiling</stage>Oh — you — yes !<stage>Then seriously .</stage>I do n't care for the atmosphere , though .<stage>He waves his hand towards the partition looking out on the porch .</stage>All those people in bed out there on the porch seem so sick . It 's depressing . I can n't do anything for them — and — it makes me feel so helpless .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MISS HOWARD</speaker>
      <p>Well , it 's the rules , you know . All the patients have to come here first until Doctor Stanton finds out whether they 're well enough to be sent out to the huts and cottages . And remember you 're a patient just like the ones in bed out there — even if you are up and about .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>I know it . But I do n't feel as I were — really sick like them .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MISS HOWARD</speaker>
      <p><stage>wisely</stage>None of them do , either .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>after a moment 's reflection — cynically</stage>Yes , I suppose it 's that pipe dream that keeps us all going , eh ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MISS HOWARD</speaker>
      <p>Well , you ought to be thankful . You 're very lucky , if you knew it .<stage>Lowering her voice .</stage>Shall I tell you a secret ? I 've seen your chart and you 've no cause to worry . Doctor Stanton joked about it . He said you were too uninteresting — there was so little the matter with you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>pleased , but pretending indifference</stage>Humph ! He 's original in that opinion .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MISS HOWARD</speaker>
      <p>I know it 's hard your being the only one up the week since you 've been here , with no one to talk to ; but there 's another patient due to-day . Maybe she 'll be well enough to be around with you .<stage>With a quick glance at her wrist watch .</stage>She can n't be coming unless she got in on the last train .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>interestedly</stage>It 's a she , eh ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MISS HOWARD</speaker>
      <p>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>grinning provokingly</stage>Young ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MISS HOWARD</speaker>
      <p>Eighteen , I believe .<stage>Seeing his grin — with feigned pique .</stage>I suppose you 'll be asking if she 's pretty next ! Oh , you men are all alike , sick or well . Her name is Carmody , that 's the only other thing I know . So there !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>Carmody ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MISS HOWARD</speaker>
      <p>Oh , you do n't know her . She 's from another part of the state from your town .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
      <p><stage>appearing in the office doorway</stage>Miss Howard .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MISS HOWARD</speaker>
      <p>Yes , Miss Gilpin .<stage>In an aside to Murray as she leaves him .</stage>It 's time for those horrid diets .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>She hurries back into the office . Murray stares into the fire . Miss Howard reappears from the office and goes out by the door to the hall , rear . Carriage wheels are heard from the drive in front of the house on the left . They stop . After a pause there is a sharp rap on the door and a bell rings insistently . Men 's muffled voices are heard in argument . Murray turns curiously in his chair . Miss Gilpin comes from the office and walks quickly to the door , unlocking and opening it . Eileen enters , followed by Nicholls , who is carrying her suit-case , and by her father .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>I 'm Miss Carmody . I believe Doctor Gaynor wrote ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
      <p><stage>taking her hand — with kind affability</stage>We 've been expecting you all day . How do you do ? I 'm Miss Gilpin . You came on the last train , did n't you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>heartened by the other woman 's kindness</stage>Yes . This is my father , Miss Gilpin — and Mr. Nicholls .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Miss Gilpin shakes hands cordially with the two men who are staring about the room in embarrassment . Carmody has very evidently been drinking . His voice is thick and his face puffed and stupid . Nicholls ’ manner is that of one who is accomplishing a necessary but disagreeable duty with the best grace possible , but is frightfully eager to get it over and done with . Carmody 's condition embarrasses him acutely and when he glances at him it is with hatred and angry disgust .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
      <p><stage>indicating the chairs in front of the windows on the left , forward</stage>Wo n't you gentlemen sit down ?<stage>Carmody grunts sullenly and plumps himself into the one nearest the door . Nicholls hesitates , glancing down at the suit-case he carries . Miss Gilpin turns to Eileen .</stage>And now we 'll get you settled immediately . Your room is all ready for you . If you 'll follow me ——<stage>She turns toward the door in rear , centre .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>Let me take the suit-case now , Fred .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
      <p><stage>as he is about to hand it to her — decisively</stage>No , my dear , you must n't . Put the case right down there , Mr. Nicholls . I 'll have it taken to Miss Carmody 's room in a moment .<stage>She shakes her finger at Eileen with kindly admonition .</stage>That 's the first rule you 'll have to learn . Never exert yourself or tax your strength . It 's very important . You 'll find laziness is a virtue instead of a vice with us .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>confused</stage>I — I did n't know ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
      <p><stage>smiling</stage>Of course you did n't . And now if you 'll come with me I 'll show you your room . We 'll have a little chat there and I can explain all the other important rules in a second . The gentlemen can make themselves comfortable in the meantime . We wo n't be gone more than a moment .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>feeling called upon to say something</stage>Yes — we 'll wait — certainly , we 're all right .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Carmody remains silent , glowering at the fire . Nicholls sits down beside him . Miss Gilpin and Eileen go out . Murray switches his chair so that he can observe the two men out of the corner of his eye while pretending to be absorbed in his book .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>looking about shiftily and reaching for the inside pocket of his overcoat</stage>I 'll be havin ’ a nip now we 're alone , and that cacklin ’ hen gone . I 'm feelin ’ sick in the pit of the stomach .<stage>He pulls out a pint flask , half full .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>excitedly</stage>For God 's sake , do n't ! Put that bottle away !<stage>In a whisper .</stage>Do n't you see that fellow in the chair there ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>taking a big drink</stage>Ah , I 'm not mindin ’ a man at all . Sure I 'll bet it 's himself would be likin ’ a taste of the same .<stage>He appears about to get up and invite Murray to join him , but Nicholls grabs his arm .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a frightened look at Murray who appears buried in his book</stage>Stop it , you —— Do n't you know he 's probably a patient and they do n't allow them ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>scornfully</stage>A sick one , and him readin ’ a book like a dead man without a civil word out of him ! It 's queer they 'd be allowin ’ the sick ones to read books , when I 'll bet it 's the same lazy readin ’ in the house brought the half of them down with the consumption itself .<stage>Raising his voice .</stage>I 'm thinking this whole shebang is a big , thievin ’ fake — and I 've always thought so .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>furiously</stage>Put that bottle away , damn it ! And do n't shout . You 're not in a public-house .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>with provoking calm</stage>I 'll put it back when I 'm ready , not before , and no lip from you !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>with fierce disgust</stage>You 're drunk now . It 's disgusting .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>raging</stage>Drunk , am I ? Is it the like of a young jackass like you that 's still wet behind the ears to be tellin ’ me I 'm drunk ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>half-rising from his chair — pleadingly</stage>For heaven 's sake , Mr. Carmody , remember where we are and do n't raise any rumpus . What 'll Eileen say ? Do you want to make trouble for her at the start ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>puts the bottle away hastily , mumbling to himself — then glowers about the room scornfully with blinking eyes</stage>It 's a grand hotel this is , I 'm thinkin ’ , for the rich to be takin ’ their ease , and not a hospital for the poor , but the poor has to pay for it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>fearful of another outbreak</stage>Sssh !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p>Do n't be shshin ’ at me ? I 'm tellin ’ you the truth . I 'd make Eileen come back out of this to-night if that divil of a doctor did n't have me by the throat .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>glancing at him nervously</stage>I wonder how soon she 'll be back ? The carriage is waiting for us . We 'll have to hurry to make that last train back . If we miss it — it means two hours on the damn tram .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>angrily</stage>Is it anxious to get out of her sight you are , and you engaged to marry and pretendin ’ to love her ?<stage>Nicholls flushes guiltily . Murray pricks up his ears and stares over at Nicholls . The latter meets his glance , scowls , and hurriedly averts his eyes . Carmody goes on accusingly .</stage>Sure , it 's no heart at all you have — and her your sweetheart for years — and her sick with the consumption — and you wild to run away from her and leave her alone .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>springing to his feet — furiously</stage>That 's a ——!<stage>He controls himself with an effort . His voice trembles .</stage>You 're not responsible for the idiotic things you 're saying or I 'd ——<stage>He turns away , seeking some escape from the old man 's tongue .</stage>I 'll see if the man is still there with the carriage .<stage>He walks to the door on left and goes out .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>following him with his eyes</stage>Go to hell , for all I 'm preventin ’ . You 've got no guts of a man in you .<stage>He addresses Murray with the good nature inspired by the flight of Nicholls .</stage>Is it true you 're one of the consumptives , young fellow ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>delighted by this speech — with a grin</stage>Yes , I 'm one of them .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p>My name 's Carmody . What 's yours , then ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>Murray .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>slapping his thigh</stage>Irish as Paddy 's pig !<stage>Murray nods . Carmody brightens and grows confidential .</stage>I 'm glad to be knowin ’ you 're one of us . You can keep an eye on Eileen . That 's my daughter that came with us . She 's got consumption like yourself .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>I 'll be glad to do all I can .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p>Thanks to you — though it 's a grand life she 'll be havin ’ here from the fine look of the place .<stage>With whining self-pity .</stage>It 's me it 's hard on , God help me , with four small children and me widowed , and havin ’ to hire a woman to come in and look after them and the house now that Eileen 's sick ; and payin ’ for her curin ’ in this place , and me with only a bit of money in the bank for my old age . That 's hard , now , on a man , and who 'll say it is n't ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>made uncomfortable by this confidence</stage>Hard luck always comes in bunches .<stage>To head off Carmody who is about to give vent to more woe — quickly , with a glance towards the door from the hall .</stage>If I 'm not mistaken , here comes your daughter now .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>as Eileen comes into the room</stage>I 'll make you acquainted . Eileen !<stage>She comes over to them , embarrassed to find her father in his condition so chummy with a stranger . Murray rises to his feet .</stage>This is Mr. Murray , Eileen . I want you to meet . He 's Irish and he 'll put you on to the ropes of the place . He 's got the consumption , too , God pity him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>distressed</stage>Oh , Father , how can you ——<stage>With a look at Murray which pleads for her father .</stage>I 'm glad to meet you , Mr. Murray .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a straight glance at her which is so frankly admiring that she flushes and drops her eyes</stage>I 'm glad to meet you .<stage>The front door is opened and Nicholls re-appears , shivering with the cold . He stares over at the others with ill-concealed irritation .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>noticing him — with malicious satisfaction</stage>Oho , here you are again .<stage>Nicholls scowls and turns away . Carmody addresses his daughter with a sly wink at Murray .</stage>I thought Fred was slidin ’ down hill to the train with his head bare to the frost , and him so desperate hurried to get away from here . Look at the knees on him clappin ’ together with the cold , and with the great fear that 's in him he 'll be catchin ’ a sickness in this place !<stage>Nicholls , his guilty conscience stabbed to the quick , turns pale with impotent rage .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>remonstrating pitifully</stage>Father ! Please !<stage>She hurries over to Nicholls .</stage>Oh , please do n't mind him , Fred . You know what he is when he 's drinking . He does n't mean a word he 's saying .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>thickly</stage>That 's all right — for you to say . But I wo n't forget — I 'm sick and tired standing for — I 'm not used to — such people .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>shrinking from him</stage>Fred !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a furious glance at Murray</stage>Before that cheap slob , too — letting him know everything !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>faintly</stage>He seems — very nice .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p>You 've got your eyes set on him already , have you ? Leave it to you ! No fear of your not having a good time of it out here !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>Fred !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p>Well , go ahead if you want to . I do n't care . I 'll ——<stage>Startled by the look of anguish which comes over her face , he hastily swallows his words . He takes out his watch — fiercely .</stage>We 'll miss that train , damn it !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>in a stricken tone</stage>Oh , Fred !<stage>Then forcing back her tears she calls to Carmody in a strained voice .</stage>Father ! You 'll have to go now . Miss Gilpin told me to tell you you 'd have to go right away to catch the train .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>shaking hands with Murray</stage>I 'll be goin ’ . Keep your eye on her . I 'll be out soon to see her and you and me 'll have another talk .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>Glad to . Good-bye for the present .<stage>He walks to windows on the far right , turning his back considerately on their leave-taking .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>comes to Carmody and hangs on his arm as they proceed to the door</stage>Be sure and kiss them all for me — Billy and Tom and Nora and little Mary — and bring them out to see me as soon as you can , father , please ! And you come often , too , wo n't you ? And do n't forget to tell Mrs. Brennan all the directions I gave you coming out on the train . I told her , but she might n't remember — about Mary 's bath — and to give Tom his ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>impatiently</stage>Has n't she brought up brats of her own , and does n't she know the way of it ? Do n't be worryin ’ now , like a fool .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>helplessly</stage>Never mind telling her , then . I 'll write to her .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p>You 'd better not . Leave her alone . She 'll not wish you mixin ’ in with her work and tellin ’ her how to do it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>aghast</stage>Her work !<stage>She seems at the end of her tether — wrung too dry for any further emotion . She kisses her father at the door with indifference and speaks calmly .</stage>Good-bye , father .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>in a whining tone of injury</stage>A cold kiss ! And never a small tear out of her ! Is your heart a stone ?<stage>Drunken tears well from his eyes and he blubbers .</stage>And your own father going back to a lone house with a stranger in it !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>wearily , in a dead voice</stage>You 'll miss your train , father .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
      <p><stage>raging in a second</stage>I 'm off , then ! Come on , Fred . It 's no welcome we have with her here in this place — and a great curse on this day I brought her to it !<stage>He stamps out .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>in the same dead tone</stage>Good-bye , Fred .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>repenting his words of a moment ago — confusedly</stage>I 'm sorry , Eileen — for what I said . I did n't mean — you know what your father is — excuse me , wo n't you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>without feeling</stage>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p>And I 'll be out soon — in a week if I can make it . Well then ,— good-bye for the present .<stage>He bends down as if to kiss her , but she shrinks back out of his reach .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>a faint trace of mockery in her weary voice</stage>No , Fred . Remember you must n't now .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>NICHOLLS</speaker>
      <p><stage>in an instant huff</stage>Oh , if that 's the way you feel about ——</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He strides out and slams the door viciously behind him . Eileen walks slowly back towards the fire-place , her face fixed in a dead calm of despair . As she sinks into one of the armchairs , the strain becomes too much . She breaks down , hiding her face in her hands , her frail shoulders heaving with the violence of her sobs . At this sound , Murray turns from the windows and comes over near her chair .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>after watching her for a moment — in an embarrassed tone of sympathy</stage>Come on , Miss Carmody , that 'll never do . I know it 's hard at first — but — getting yourself all worked up is bad for you . You 'll run a temperature and then they 'll keep you in bed — which is n't pleasant . Take hold of yourself ! It is n't so bad up here — really — once you get used to it !<stage>The shame she feels at giving way in the presence of a stranger only adds to her loss of control and she sobs heartbrokenly . Murray walks up and down nervously , visibly nonplussed and upset . Finally he hits upon something .</stage>One of the nurses will be in any minute . You do n't want them to see you like this .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>chokes back her sobs and finally raises her face and attempts a smile</stage>I 'm sorry — to make such a sight of myself . I just could n't help it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>jocularly</stage>Well , they say a good cry does you a lot of good .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>forcing a smile</stage>I do feel — better .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>staring at her with a quizzical smile — cynically</stage>You should n't take those lovers ’ squabbles so seriously . To-morrow he 'll be sorry — you 'll be sorry . He 'll write begging forgiveness — you 'll do ditto . Result — all serene again .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>a shadow of pain on her face — with dignity</stage>Do n't — please .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>angry at himself — hanging his head contritely</stage>I 'm a fool . Pardon me . I 'm rude sometimes — before I know it .<stage>He shakes off his confusion with a renewed attempt at a joking tone .</stage>You can blame your father for any breaks I make . He made me your guardian , you know — told me to see that you behaved .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a genuine smile</stage>Oh , father !<stage>Flushing .</stage>You must n't mind anything he said to-night .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>thoughtlessly</stage>Yes , he was well lit up . I envied him .<stage>Eileen looks very shame-faced . Murray sees it and exclaims in exasperation at himself .</stage>Darn ! There I go again putting my foot in it !<stage>With an irrepressible grin .</stage>I ought to have my tongue operated on — that 's what 's the matter with me .<stage>He laughs and throws himself in a chair .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>forced in spite of herself to smile with him</stage>You 're candid , at any rate , Mr. Murray .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>Do n't misunderstand me . Far be it from me to cast slurs at your father 's high spirits . I said I envied him his jag and that 's the truth . The same candour compels me to confess that I was pickled to the gills myself when I arrived here . Fact ! I made love to all the nurses and generally disgraced myself — and had a wonderful time .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>I suppose it does make you forget your troubles — for a while .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>waving this aside</stage>I did n't want to forget — not for a second . I was n't drowning my sorrow . I was hilariously celebrating .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>astonished — by this time quite interested in this queer fellow to the momentary forgetfulness of her own grief</stage>Celebrating — coming here ? But — are n't you sick ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>T. B .? Yes , of course .<stage>Confidentially .</stage>But it 's only a matter of time when I 'll be all right again . I hope it wo n't be too soon . I was dying for a rest — a good , long rest with time to think about things . I 'm due to get what I wanted here . That 's why I celebrated .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>with wide eyes</stage>I wonder if you really mean ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>What I 've been sayin ’ ? I sure do — every word of it !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>puzzled</stage>I can n't understand how anyone could ——<stage>With a worried glance over her shoulder .</stage>I think I 'd better look for Miss Gilpin , had n't I ? She may wonder ——<stage>She half rises from her chair .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>quickly</stage>No . Please do n't go yet . Sit down . Please do .<stage>She glances at him irresolutely , then resumes her chair .</stage>They 'll give you your diet of milk and shoo you off to bed on that freezing porch soon enough , do n't worry . I 'll see to it that you do n't fracture any rules .<stage>Hitching his chair nearer hers — impulsively .</stage>In all charity to me you 've got to stick awhile . I have n't had a chance to really talk to a soul for a week . You found what I said a while ago hard to believe , did n't you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a smile</stage>Is n't it ? You said you hoped you would n't get well too soon !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>And I meant it ! This place is honestly like heaven to me — a lonely heaven till your arrival .<stage>Eileen looks embarrassed .</stage>And why would n't it be ? I 've no fear for my health — eventually . Just let me tell you what I was getting away from ——<stage>With a sudden laugh full of a weary bitterness .</stage>Do you know what it means to work from seven at night till three in the morning as a reporter on a morning newspaper in a town of twenty thousand people — for ten years ? No . You do n't . You can n't . No one could who had n't been through the mill . But what it did to me — it made me happy — yes , happy !— to get out here — T. B . and all , notwithstanding .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>looking at him curiously</stage>But I always thought being a reporter was so interesting .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a cynical laugh</stage>Interesting ? On a small town rag ? A month of it , perhaps , when you 're a kid and new to the game . But ten years . Think of it ! With only a raise of a couple of dollars every blue moon or so , and a weekly spree on Saturday night to vary the monotony .<stage>He laughs again .</stage>Interesting , eh ? Getting the dope on the Social of the Queen Esther Circle in the basement of the Methodist Episcopal Church , unable to sleep through a meeting of the Common Council on account of the noisy oratory caused by John Smith 's application for a permit to build a house ; making a note that a tugboat towed two barges loaded with coal up the river , that Mrs. Perkins spent a week-end with relatives in Hickville , that John Jones —— Oh help ! Why go on ? Ten years of it ! I 'm a broken man . God , how I used to pray that our Congressman would commit suicide , or the Mayor murder his wife — just to be able to write a real story !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a smile</stage>Is it as bad as that ? But were n't there other things in the town — outside your work — that were interesting ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p><stage>decidedly</stage>No . Never anything new — and I knew everyone and every thing in town by heart years ago .<stage>With sudden bitterness .</stage>Oh , it was my own fault . Why did n't I get out of it ? Well , I did n't . I was always going to — to-morrow — and to-morrow never came . I got in a rut — and stayed put . People seem to get that way , somehow — in that town . It 's in the air . All the boys I grew up with — nearly all , at least — took root in the same way . It took pleurisy , followed by T. B ., to blast me loose .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>wonderingly</stage>But — your family — did n't they live there ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>I have n't much of a family left . My mother died when I was a kid . My father — he was a lawyer — died when I was nineteen , just about to go to college . He left nothing , so I went to work on the paper instead . And there I 've been ever since . I 've two sisters , respectably married and living in another part of the state . We do n't get along — but they are paying for me here , so I suppose I 've no kick .<stage>Cynically .</stage>A family would n't have changed things . From what I 've seen that blood-thicker-than-water dope is all wrong . It 's thinner than table-d'hôte soup . You may have seen a bit of that truth in your own case already .</p>

      <p><stage>shocked</stage>How can you say that ? You do n't know ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>Do n't I , though ? Wait till you 've been here three months or four — when the gap you left has been comfortably filled . You 'll see then !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>angrily , her lips trembling</stage>You must be crazy to say such things !<stage>Fighting back her tears .</stage>Oh , I think it 's hateful — when you see how badly I feel !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>in acute confusion . Stammering</stage>Look here , Miss Carmody , I did n't mean to —— Listen — do n't feel mad at me , please . My tongue ran away with me . I was only talking . I 'm like that . You must n't take it seriously .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>still resentful</stage>I do n't see how you can talk . You do n't — you can n't know about these things — when you 've just said you had no family of your own , really .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>eager to return to her good graces</stage>No . Of course I do n't know . I was just talking regardless for the fun of listening to it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>after a pause</stage>Has n't either of your sisters any children ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>One of them has — two of them — ugly , squally little brats .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>disapprovingly</stage>You do n't like babies ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>bluntly</stage>No .<stage>Then with a grin at her shocked face .</stage>I do n't get them . They 're something I can n't seem to get acquainted with .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a smile , indulgently</stage>You 're a funny person .<stage>Then with a superior , motherly air .</stage>No wonder you could n't understand how badly I feel .<stage>With a tender smile .</stage>I 've four of them — my brothers and sisters — though they 're not what you 'd call babies , except to me . Billy is fourteen , Nora eleven , Tom ten , and even little Mary is eight . I 've been a mother to them now for a whole year — ever since our mother died<stage>Sadly .</stage>And I do n't know how they 'll ever get along while I 'm away .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>cynically</stage>Oh , they 'll —<stage>He checks what he was going to say and adds lamely</stage>— get along somehow .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>with the same superior tone</stage>It 's easy for you to say that . You do n't know how children grow to depend on you for everything . You 're not a woman .</p>

      <p><stage>flushing , with a shy smile</stage>Someone ought to .<stage>Quickly changing the subject .</stage>Do you know , I can n't get over what you said about hating your work so . I should think it would be wonderful — to be able to write things .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>My job had nothing to do with writing . To write — really write — yes , that 's something worth trying for . That 's what I 've always meant to have a stab at . I 've run across ideas enough for stories — that sounded good to me , anyway .<stage>With a forced , laugh .</stage>But — like everything else — I never got down to it . I started one or two — but — either I thought I did n't have the time or ——<stage>He shrugs his shoulders .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>Well , you 've plenty of time now , have n't you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>instantly struck by this suggestion</stage>You mean — I could write — up here ?<stage>She nods . His face lights up with enthusiasm .</stage>Say ! That is an idea ! Thank you ! I 'd never have had sense enough to have thought of that myself .<stage>Eileen flushes with pleasure .</stage>Sure there 's time — nothing but time up here ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>Then you seriously think you 'll try it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>determinedly</stage>Yes . Why not ? I 've got to try and do something real some time , have n't I ? I 've no excuse not to , now . My mind is n't sick .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>excitedly</stage>That 'll be wonderful !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>confidently</stage>Listen . I 've had ideas for a series of short stories for the last couple of years — small town experiences , some of them actual . I know that life — too darn well . I ought to be able to write about it . And if I can sell one — to the Post , say — I 'm sure they 'd take the others , too . And then — I should worry ! It 'd be easy sailing . But you must promise to help — play critic for me — read them and tell me where they 're rotten .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>pleased , but protesting</stage>Oh , no , I 'd never dare . I do n't know anything ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>Yes , you do . You 're the public . And you started me off on this thing — if I 'm really starting at last . So you 've got to back me up now .<stage>Suddenly .</stage>Say , I wonder if they 'd let me have a typewriter up here ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>It 'd be fine if they would . I 'd like to have one , too — to practice . I learned stenography at a business college and then I had a position for a year — before my mother died .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>We could hire one — I could . I do n't see why they would n't allow it . I 'm to be sent to one of the men 's huts within the next few days , and you 'll be shipped to one of the women 's cottages within ten days . You 're not sick enough to be kept here in bed , I 'm sure of that .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>I — I do n't know ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>Here ! None of that ! You just think you 're not and you wo n't be . Say , I 'm keen on that typewriter idea . They could n't kick if we only used it during recreation periods . I could have it a week , and then you a week .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>eagerly</stage>And I could type your stories after you 've written them ! I could help that way .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>smiling</stage>But I 'm quite able ——<stage>Then seeing how interested she is he adds hurriedly .</stage>That 'd be great ! It 'd save so much time .

     </sp>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a laugh</stage>Maybe , after you 've read my stuff , you wo n't type it at any price .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
      <p>Miss Carmody , may I speak to you for a moment , please .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>She takes Eileen aside and talks to her in low tones of admonition . Eileen 's face falls . She nods a horrified acquiescence . Miss Gilpin leaves her and goes into the office , rear .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>as Eileen comes back . Noticing her perturbation . Kindly</stage>Well ? Now , what 's the trouble ?</p>

      <p><stage>consolingly</stage>Yes , that 's one of the rules , you know .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>falteringly</stage>She said they 'd give me — a — cup to carry around —<stage>She stops , shuddering .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>easily</stage>It 's not as horrible as it sounds . They 're only little paste-board things you carry in your pocket .</p>

      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>as if speaking to herself</stage>It 's so horrible<stage>She holds out her hand to Murray .</stage>I 'm to go to my room now . Good night , Mr. Murray .</p>

      <p><stage>holding her hand for a moment — earnestly</stage>Do n't mind your first impressions here . You 'll look on everything as a matter of course in a few days .

     <stage>Eileen goes out to the hall in rear . Miss Howard comes in from the door just after her , carrying a glass of milk .</stage>

      <p><stage>with a grin</stage>Sure thing ! You can consider yourself heartlessly jilted .<stage>He turns and raises his glass towards the door through which Eileen has just gone , as if toasting her .</stage>“ A glass of milk , and thou Coughing beside me in the wilderness — Ah — wilderness were Paradise enow ! ”</p>

     <stage type="setting">
      <stage>The assembly room of the main building of the sanatorium — early in the morning of a fine day in June , four months later . The room is large , light and airy , painted a fresh white . On the left forward , an armchair . Farther back , a door opening on the main hall . To the rear of this door , a pianola on a raised platform . At back of the pianola , a door leading into the office . In the rear wall , a long series of French windows looking out on the lawn , with wooded hills in the far background . Shrubs in flower grow immediately outside the windows Inside , there is a row of potted plants . In the right wall , rear , four windows . Farther forward , a long well-filled bookcase , and a doorway leading into the dining-room . Following the walls , but about five feet out from them a stiff line of chairs placed closely against each other forms a sort of right-angled auditorium of which the large , square table that stands at centre , forward , would seem to be the stage .</stage>
      <stage>From the dining-room comes the clatter of dishes , the confused murmur of many voices , male and female — all the mingled sounds of a crowd of people at a meal .</stage>
      <stage>After the curtain rises , Doctor Stanton enters from the hall , followed by a visitor , Mr. Sloan , and the assistant physician , Doctor Simms . Doctor Stanton is a handsome man of forty-five or so with a grave , care-lined , studious face lightened by a kindly , humorous smile . His grey eyes , saddened by the suffering they have witnessed , have the sympathetic quality of real understanding . The look they give is full of companionship , the courage-renewing , human companionship of a hope which is shared . He speaks with a slight Southern accent , soft and slurring . Doctor Simms is a tall , angular young man with a long sallow face and a sheepish , self-conscious grin . Mr. Sloan is fifty , short and stout , well dressed — one of the successful business men whose endowments have made the Hill Farm a possibility .</stage>
     </stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STANTON</speaker>
      <p><stage>as they enter</stage>This is what you might see in the general assembly room , Mr. Sloan — where the patients of both sexes are allowed to congregate together after meals , for diets , and in the evening .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLOAN</speaker>
      <p><stage>looking around him</stage>Could n't be more pleasant , I must say — light and airy .<stage>He walks to where he can take a peep into the dining-room .</stage>Ah , they 're all at breakfast , I see .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STANTON</speaker>
      <p><stage>smiling</stage>Yes , and with no lack of appetite , let me tell you .<stage>With a laugh of proud satisfaction .</stage>They 'd sure eat us out of house and home at one sitting , if we 'd give them the opportunity .<stage>To his assistant .</stage>Would n't they , Doctor ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SIMMS</speaker>
      <p><stage>with his abashed grin</stage>You bet they would , sir .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLOAN</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a smile</stage>That 's fine .<stage>With a nod towards the dining-room .</stage>The ones in there are the sure cures , are n't they ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STANTON</speaker>
      <p><stage>a shadow coming over his face</stage>Strictly speaking , there are no sure cures in this disease , Mr. Sloan . When we permit a patient to return to take up his or her activities in the world , the patient is what we call an arrested case . The disease is overcome , quiescent ; the wound is healed over . It 's then up to the patient to so take care of himself that this condition remains permanent . It is n't hard for them to do this , usually . Just ordinary , bull-headed common sense — added to what they 've learned here — is enough for their safety . And the precautions we teach them to take do n't diminish their social usefulness in the slightest , either , as I can prove by our statistics of former patients .<stage>With a smile .</stage>It 's rather early in the morning for statistics , though .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLOAN</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a wave of the hand</stage>Oh , you need n't . Your reputation in that respect , Doctor ——<stage>Stanton inclines his head in acknowledgment . Sloan jerks his thumb towards the dining-room .</stage>But the ones in there are getting well , are n't they ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STANTON</speaker>
      <p>To all appearances , yes . You do n't dare swear to it , though . Sometimes , just when a case looks most favourably , there 's a sudden , unforeseen breakdown , and they have to be sent back to bed , or , if it 's very serious , back to the Infirmary again . These are the exceptions , however , not the rule . You can bank on most of those eaters being out in the world and usefully employed within six months .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLOAN</speaker>
      <p>You could n't say more than that<stage>Abruptly .</stage>But — the unfortunate ones — do you have many deaths ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STANTON</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a frown</stage>No . We 're under a very hard , almost cruel imperative which prevents that . If , at the end of six months , a case shows no response to treatment , continues to go down hill — if , in a word , it seems hopeless — we send them away , to one of the State Farms if they have no private means .<stage>Apologetically .</stage>You see , this sanatorium is overcrowded and has a long waiting list , most of the time , of others who demand their chance for life . We have to make places for them . We have no time to waste on incurables . There are other places for them — and sometimes , too , a change is beneficial and they pick up in new surroundings . You never can tell . But we 're bound by the rule . It may seem cruel — but it 's as near justice to all concerned as we can come .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLOAN</speaker>
      <p><stage>soberly</stage>I see .<stage>His eyes fall on the pianola in surprise .</stage>Ah — a piano .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STANTON</speaker>
      <p><stage>replying to the other 's thought</stage>Yes , some patients play and sing .<stage>With a smile .</stage>If you 'd call the noise they make by those terms . They 'd dance , too , if we permitted it . There 's only one big taboo — Home , Sweet Home . We forbid that — for obvious reasons .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLOAN</speaker>
      <p>I see .<stage>With a final look around .</stage>Did I understand you to say this is the only place where the sexes are permitted to mingle ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STANTON</speaker>
      <p>Yes , sir .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLOAN</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a smile</stage>Not much chance for a love affair then .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STANTON</speaker>
      <p><stage>seriously</stage>We do our best to prevent them . We even have a strict rule which allows us to step in and put a stop to any intimacy which grows beyond the casual . People up here , Mr. Sloan , are expected to put aside all ideas except the one — getting well .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLOAN</speaker>
      <p><stage>somewhat embarrassed</stage>A damn good rule , too , I should say , under the circumstances .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STANTON</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a laugh</stage>Yes , we 're strictly anti-Cupid , sir , from top to bottom ,<stage>Turning to the door to the hall .</stage>And now , if you do n't mind , Mr. Sloan , I 'm going to turn you loose to wander about the grounds on an unconducted tour . To-day is my busy morning — Saturday . We weigh each patient immediately after breakfast .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLOAN</speaker>
      <p>Every week ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STANTON</speaker>
      <p>Every Saturday . You see we depend on fluctuations in weight to tell us a lot about the patient 's condition . If they gain , or stay at normal , all 's usually well . If they lose week after week without any reason we can definitely point to , we keep careful watch . It 's a sign that something 's wrong . We 're forewarned by it and on our guard .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>SLOAN</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a smile</stage>Well , I 'm certainly learning things .<stage>He turns to the door .</stage>And you just shoo me off wherever you please and go on with the good work . I 'll be glad of a ramble in the open on such a glorious morning .</p>

      <p>After the weighing is over , sir , I 'll be free to ——</p>

     <stage>His words are lost as the three go out . A moment later , Eileen enters from the dining-room . She has grown stouter , her face has more of a healthy , out-of-door colour , but there is still about her the suggestion of being worn down by a burden too oppressive for her courage . She is dressed in blouse and dark skirt . She goes to the armchair , left forward , and sinks down on it . She is evidently in a state of nervous depression ; she twists her fingers together in her lap ; her eyes stare sadly before her ; she clenches her upper lip with her teeth to prevent its trembling . She has hardly regained control over herself when Stephen Murray comes in hurriedly from the dining-room and , seeing her at his first glance , walks quickly over to her chair . He is the picture of health , his figure has filled out solidly , his tanned face beams with suppressed exultation .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>excitedly</stage>Eileen ! I saw you leave your table . I 've something to tell you . I did n't get a chance last night after the mail came . You 'd gone to the cottage . Just listen , Eileen — it 's too good to be true — but on that mail — guess what ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>

      <p><stage>happily</stage>Is n't that wonderful , Stephen ! But I knew all the time you would . The story 's so good .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>Well , you might have known , but I did n't think there was a chance in the world . And as for being good —<stage>With superior air</stage>— wait till I turn loose with the real big ones , the kind I 'm going to write . Then I 'll make them sit up and take notice . They can n't stop me now . This money gives me a chance to sit back and do what I please for a while . And I have n't told you the best part . The editor wrote saying how much he liked the yarn and asked me for more of the same kind .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>And you 've the three others about the same person — just as good , too ! Why , you 'll sell them all !<stage>She clasps her hands delightedly .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>And I can send them out right away . They 're all typed , thanks to you . That 's what 's brought me luck , I know . I never had a bit by myself .<stage>Then , after a quick glance around to make sure they are alone , he bends down and kisses her .</stage>There ! A token of gratitude — even if it is against the rules .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>flushing — with timid happiness</stage>Stephen ! You must n't ! They 'll see .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>boldly</stage>Let them !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>But you know — they 've warned us against being so much together , already .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>Let them ! We 'll be out of this prison soon .<stage>Eileen shakes her head sadly , but he does not notice .</stage>Oh , I wish you could leave when I do . We 'd have some celebration together .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>her lips trembling</stage>I was thinking last night — that you 'd soon be going away . You look so well . Do you think — they 'll let you go — soon ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>You bet I do . I 'm bound to go now . It 's ridiculous keeping me here when I 'm as healthy as a pig . I caught Stanton in the hall last night and asked him if I could go .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>anxiously</stage>What did he say ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>He only smiled and said : “ We 'll see if you gain weight to-morrow . ” As if that mattered now ! Why , I 'm way above normal as it is ! But you know Stanton — always putting you off . But I could tell by the way he said it he 'd be willing to consider ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>slowly</stage>Then — if you gain to-day — -</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>He 'll let me go . Yes , I know he will . I 'm going to insist on it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>Then — you 'll leave ——?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>Right away . The minute I can get packed .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>trying to force a smile</stage>Oh , I 'm so glad — for your sake ; but — I 'm selfish — it 'll be so lonely here without you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>consolingly</stage>You 'll be going away yourself before long .<stage>Eileen shakes her head . He goes on without noticing , wrapped in his own success .</stage>Oh , Eileen , you can n't imagine all it opens up for me — selling that story . I do n't have to go back home to stagnate . I can go straight to New York , and live , and meet real people who are doing things . I can take my time , and try and do the work I hope to .<stage>Feelingly .</stage>You do n't know how grateful I am to you , Eileen — how you 've helped me . Oh , I do n't mean just the typing , I mean your encouragement , your faith ! I 'd never have had guts enough to stick to it myself . The stories would never have been written if it had n't been for you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>choking back a sob</stage>I did n't do — anything .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>staring down at her — with rough kindliness</stage>Here , here , that 'll never do ! You 're not weeping about it , are you , silly ?<stage>He pats her on the shoulder .</stage>What 's the matter , Eileen ? You did n't eat a thing this morning . I was watching you .<stage>With kindly severity .</stage>That 's no way to gain weight , you know . You 'll have to feed up . Do you hear what your guardian commands , eh ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>with dull hopelessness</stage>I know I 'll lose again . I 've been losing steadily the past three weeks .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>Here ! Do n't you dare talk that way ! I wo n't stand for it . Why , you 've been picking up wonderfully — until just lately . You 've made such a game fight for four months . Even the old Doc has told you how much he admired your pluck , and how much better you were getting . You 're not going to quit now , are you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>despairingly</stage>Oh , I do n't care ! I do n't care — now .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>Now ? What do you mean by that ? What 's happened to make things any different ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>evasively</stage>Oh — nothing . Do n't ask me , Stephen .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>with sudden anger</stage>I do n't have to ask you . I can guess . Another letter from home — or from that ass , eh ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>shaking her head</stage>No , it is n't that .<stage>She looks at him as if imploring him to comprehend .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>furiously</stage>Of course , you 'd deny it . You always do . But do n't you suppose I 've got eyes ? It 's been the same damn thing all the time you 've been here . After every nagging letter — thank God they do n't write often any more !— you 've been all in ; and after their Sunday visits — you can thank God they 've been few , too — you 're utterly knocked out . It 's a shame ! The selfish swine !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>Stephen !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>relentlessly .</stage>Do n't be sentimental , Eileen . You know it 's true . From what you 've told me of their letters , their visits — from what I 've seen and suspected — they 've done nothing but worry and torment you and do their best to keep you from getting well .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>faintly</stage>You 're not fair , Stephen .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>Rot ! When it is n't your father grumbling about expense , it 's the kids , or that stupid housekeeper , or that slick Aleck , Nicholls , with his cowardly lies . Which is it this time ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>pitifully</stage>None of them .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>explosively</stage>But him , especially — the dirty cad ! Oh , I 've got a rich notion to pay a call on that gentleman when I leave and tell him what I think of him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>quickly</stage>No — you must n't ever ! He 's not to blame . If you knew ——<stage>She stops , lowering her eyes in confusion .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>roughly</stage>Knew what ? You make me sick , Eileen — always finding excuses for him . I never could understand what a girl like you could see —— But what 's the use ? I 've said all this before . You 're wasting yourself on a ——<stage>Rudely .</stage>Love must be blind . And yet you say you do n't love him , really ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>shaking her head — helplessly</stage>But I do — like Fred . We 've been good friends so many years . I do n't want to hurt him — his pride ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>That 's the same as answering no to my question . Then , if you do n't love him , why do n't you write and tell him to go to — break it off ?<stage>Eileen bows her head , but does n't reply . Irritated , Murray continues brutally .</stage>Are you afraid it would break his heart ? Do n't be a fool ! The only way you could do that would be to deprive him of his meals .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>springing to her feet — distractedly</stage>Please stop , Stephen ! You 're cruel ! And you 've been so kind — the only real friend I 've had up here . Do n't spoil it all now .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>remorsefully</stage>I 'm sorry , Eileen . I was only talking . I wo n't say another word .<stage>Irritably .</stage>Still , someone ought to say or do something to put a stop to ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a broken laugh</stage>Never mind . Everything will stop — soon , now !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>suspiciously</stage>What do you mean ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>with an attempt at a careless tone</stage>Nothing . If you can n't see ——<stage>She turns to him with sudden intensity .</stage>Oh , Stephen , if you only knew how wrong you are about everything you 've said . It 's all true ; but it is n't that — any of it — any more — that 's —— Oh , I can n't tell you !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>with great interest</stage>Please do , Eileen !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a helpless laugh</stage>No .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>Please tell me what it is ! Let me help you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>No . It would n't be any use , Stephen .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>offended</stage>Why do you say that ? Have n't I helped before ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>Yes — but this ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>Come now ! ‘ Fess up ! What is “ this ” ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>No . I could n't speak of it here , anyway . They 'll all be coming out soon .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>insistently</stage>Then when ? Where ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>Oh , I do n't know — perhaps never , nowhere . I do n't know ——</l>
       <l>Sometime before you leave , maybe .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>But I may go to-morrow morning — if I gain weight and Stanton lets me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>sadly</stage>Yes , I was forgetting — you were going right away .<stage>Dully</stage>Then nowhere , I suppose — never .<stage>Glancing towards the dining-room .</stage>They 're all getting up . Let 's not talk about it any more — now .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>stubbornly</stage>But you 'll tell me later , Eileen ? You must .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>vaguely</stage>Perhaps . It depends ——</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>The patients , about forty in number , straggle in from the dining-room by twos and threes , chatting in low tones . The men and women with few exceptions separate into two groups , the women congregating in the left right angle of chairs , the men sitting or standing in the right right angle . In appearance , most of the patients are tanned , healthy , and cheerful-looking . The great majority are under middle age . Their clothes are of the cheap , ready-made variety . They are all distinctly of the wage-earning class . They might well be a crowd of cosmopolitan factory workers gathered together after a summer vacation . A hollow-chestedness and a tendency to round shoulders may be detected as a common characteristic . A general air of tension , marked by frequent bursts of laughter in too high a key , seems to pervade the throng . Murray and Eileen , as if to avoid contact with the others , come over to the right in front of the dining-room door .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>in a low voice</stage>Listen to them laugh . Did you ever notice — perhaps it 's my imagination — how forced they act on Saturday mornings before they 're weighed ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>dully</stage>No .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>Ca n't you tell me that secret now ? No one 'll hear .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>vehemently</stage>No , no , how could I ? Do n't speak of it !<stage>A sudden silence falls on all the groups at once . Their eyes , by a common impulse , turn quickly towards the door to the hall .</stage>A WOMAN<stage>nervously — as if this moment 's silent pause oppressed her .</stage>Play something , Peters . They ai n't coming yet .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Peters , a stupid-looking young fellow with a sly , twisted smirk which gives him the appearance of perpetually winking his eye , detaches himself from a group on the right . All join in with urging exclamations : “ Go on , Peters ! Go to it ! Pedal up , Pete ! Give us a rag ! That 's the boy , Peters ! ” etc .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PETERS</speaker>
      <p>Sure , if I got time .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He goes to the pianola and puts in a roll . The mingled conversation and laughter bursts forth again as he sits on the bench and starts pedalling .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>disgustedly</stage>It 's sure good to think I wo n't have to listen to that old tin-pan being banged much longer !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>The music interrupts him — a quick rag . The patients brighten , hum , whistle , sway their heads or tap their feet in time to the tune . Doctor Stanton and Doctor Simms appear in the doorway from the hall . All eyes are turned on them .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STANTON</speaker>
      <p><stage>raising his voice</stage>They all seem to be here , Doctor . We might as well start .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Mrs. Turner , the matron , comes in behind them — a stout , motherly , capable-looking woman with grey hair . She hears Stanton 's remark .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>TURNER . And take temperatures after , Doctor ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STANTON</speaker>
      <p>Yes , Mrs. Turner . I think that 's better to-day .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>TURNER . All right , Doctor .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Stanton and the assistant go out . Mrs. Turner advances a step or so into the room and looks from one group of patients to the other , inclining her head and smiling benevolently . All force smiles and nod in recognition of her greeting . Peters , at the pianola , lets the music slow down , glancing questioningly at the matron to see if she is going to order it stopped . Then , encouraged by her smile , his feet pedal harder than ever .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>Look at old Mrs. Grundy 's eyes pinned on us ! She 'll accuse us of being too familiar again , the old wench !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>Sssh . You 're wrong . She 's looking at me , not at us .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>At you ? Why ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>I ran a temperature yesterday . It must have been over a hundred last night .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>with consoling scepticism</stage>You 're always looking for trouble , Eileen . How do you know you ran a temp ? You did n't see the stick , I suppose ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>No — but — I could tell . I felt feverish and chilly . It must have been way up .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>Bosh ! If it was you 'd have been sent to bed .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>That 's why she 's looking at me .<stage>Piteously .</stage>Oh , I do hope I wo n't be sent back to bed ! I do n't know what I 'd do . If I could only gain this morning . If my temp has only gone down !<stage>Hopelessly .</stage>But I feel —— I did n't sleep a wink — thinking ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>roughly</stage>You 'll persuade yourself you 've got leprosy in a second . Do n't be silly ! It 's all imagination , I tell you . You 'll gain . Wait and see if you do n't .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Eileen shakes her head . A metallic rumble and jangle comes from the hallway . Everyone turns in that direction with nervous expectancy .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>TURNER<stage>admonishingly</stage>Mr. Peters !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PETERS</speaker>
      <p>Yes , ma'am .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He stops playing and rejoins the group of men on the right . In the midst of a silence broken only by hushed murmurs of conversation , Doctor Stanton appears in the hall doorway . He turns to help his assistant wheel in a Fairbanks scale on castors . They place the scale against the wall immediately to the rear of the doorway . Doctor Simms adjusts it to a perfect balance .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DOCTOR STANTON</speaker>
      <p><stage>takes a pencil from his pocket and opens the record book he has in his hand</stage>All ready , Doctor ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DOCTOR SIMMS</speaker>
      <p>Just a second , sir .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>A chorus of coughs comes from the impatient crowd , and handkerchiefs are hurriedly produced to shield mouths .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a nervous smile</stage>Well , we 're all set . Here 's hoping !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>You 'll gain , I 'm sure you will . You look so well .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>Oh — I — I was n't thinking of myself , I 'm a sure thing . I was betting on you . I 've simply got to gain to-day , when so much depends on it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>Yes , I hope you ——<stage>She falters brokenly and turns away from him .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DOCTOR SIMMS</speaker>
      <p><stage>straightening up</stage>All ready , Doctor ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STANTON</speaker>
      <p><stage>nods and glances at his book — without raising his voice — distinctly</stage>Mrs. Abner .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>A middle-aged woman comes and gets on the scale . Simms adjusts it to her weight of the previous week , which Stanton reads to him from the book in a low voice , and weighs her .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a relieved sigh</stage>They 're off .<stage>Noticing Eileen 's downcast head and air of dejection .</stage>Here ! Buck up , Eileen ! Old Lady Grundy 's watching you — and it 's your turn in a second .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Eileen raises her head and forces a frightened smile . Mrs. Abner gets down off the scale with a pleased grin . She has evidently gained . She rejoins the group of women , chattering volubly in low tones . Her exultant “ gained half a pound ” can be heard . The other women smile their perfunctory congratulations , their eyes absent-minded , intent on their own worries . Stanton writes down the weight in the book .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STANTON</speaker>
      <p>Miss Bailey .<stage>A young girl goes to the scales .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>Bailey looks bad , does n't she ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>her lips trembling</stage>She 's been losing , too .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>Well , you 're going to gain to-day . Remember , now !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a feeble smile</stage>I 'll try to obey your orders .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Miss Bailey goes down off the scales . Her eyes are full of despondency although she tries to make a brave face of it , forcing a laugh as she joins the women . They stare at her with pitying looks and murmur consoling phrases .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>She 's lost again . Oh , I wish I did n't have to get weighed ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STANTON</speaker>
      <p>Miss Carmody .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Eileen starts nervously .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>as she leaves him</stage>Remember now ! Break the scales !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>She walks quickly to the scales , trying to assume an air of defiant indifference . The balance stays down as she steps up . Eileen 's face shows her despair at this . Simms weighs her and gives the poundage in a low voice to Stanton . Eileen steps down mechanically , then hesitates as if not knowing where to turn , her anguished eyes flitting from one group to another .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>savagely</stage>Damn !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Doctor Stanton writes the figures in his book , glances sharply at Eileen , and then nods significantly to Mrs. Turner who is standing beside him .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STANTON</speaker>
      <p><stage>calling the next</stage>Miss Doeffler .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Another woman comes to be weighed .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>TURNER . Miss Carmody ! Will you come here a moment , please ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>her face growing very pale</stage>Yes , Mrs. Turner .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>The heads of the different groups bend together . Their eyes follow Eileen as they whisper . Mrs. Turner leads her down front , left . Behind them the weighing of the women continues briskly . The great majority have gained . Those who have not have either remained stationary or lost a negligible fraction of a pound . So , as the weighing proceeds , the general air of smiling satisfaction rises among the groups of women . Some of them , their ordeal over , go out through the hall doorway by twos and threes with suppressed laughter and chatter . As they pass behind Eileen they glance at her with pitying curiosity . Doctor Stanton 's voice is heard at regular intervals calling the names in alphabetical order : Mrs. Elbing , Miss Finch , Miss Grimes , Miss Haines , Miss Hayes , Miss Jutner , Miss Linowski , Mrs. Marini , Mrs. McCoy , Miss McElroy , Miss Nelson , Mrs. Nott , Mrs. O'Brien , Mrs. Olson , Miss Paul , Miss Petrovski , Mrs. Quinn , Miss Robersi , Mrs. Stattler , Miss Unger .</stage>

      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>TURNER<stage>putting her hand on Eileen 's shoulder — kindly</stage>You 're not looking so well lately , my dear , do you know it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>bravely</stage>I feel — fine .<stage>Her eyes , as if looking for encouragement , seek Murray , who is staring at her worriedly .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>TURNER<stage>gently</stage>You lost weight again , you know .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>, I know — but ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>TURNER . This is the fourth week .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>I — I know it is ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>TURNER . I 've been keeping my eye on you . You seem — worried . Are you upset about — something we do n't know ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>quickly</stage>No , no ! I have n't slept much lately . That must be it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>TURNER . Are you worrying about your condition ? Is that what keeps you awake ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>No .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>TURNER . You 're sure it 's not that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>Yes , I 'm sure it 's not , Mrs. Turner .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>TURNER . I was going to tell you if you were : Do n't do it ! You can n't expect it to be all smooth sailing . Even the most favourable cases have to expect these little setbacks . A few days ’ rest in bed will start you on the right trail again .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>in anguish , although she had realised this was coming</stage>Bed ? Go back to bed ? Oh , Mrs. Turner !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>TURNER<stage>gently</stage>Yes , my dear , Doctor Stanton thinks it best . So when you go back to your cottage ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>Oh , please — not to-day — not right away !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>TURNER . You had a temperature and a high pulse yesterday , did n't you realise it ? And this morning you look quite feverish .<stage>She tries to put her hand on Eileen 's forehead , but the latter steps away defensively .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>It 's only — not sleeping last night . I was nervous . Oh , I 'm sure it 'll go away .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>TURNER<stage>consolingly</stage>When you lie still and have perfect rest , of course it will .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a longing look over at Murray</stage>But not to-day — please , Mrs. Turner .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>TURNER<stage>looking at her keenly</stage>There is something upsetting you . You 've something on your mind that you can n't tell me , is that it ?<stage>Eileen maintains a stubborn silence .</stage>But think — can n't you tell me ?<stage>With a kindly smile .</stage>I 'm used to other people 's troubles . I 've been playing mother-confessor to the patients for years now , and I think I 've usually been able to help them . Ca n't you confide in me , child ?<stage>Eileen drops her eyes , but remains silent . Mrs. Turner glances meaningly over at Murray , who is watching them whenever he thinks the matron is not aware of it — a note of sharp rebuke in her voice .</stage>I think I can guess your secret , my dear , even if you 're too stubborn to tell . This setback is your own fault . You 've let other notions become more important to you than the idea of getting well . And you 've no excuse for it . After I had to warn you a month ago , I expected that silliness to stop instantly .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>her face flushed — protesting</stage>There never was anything . Nothing like that has anything to do with it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>TURNER<stage>sceptically</stage>What is it that has , then ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>lying determinedly</stage>It 's my family . They keep writing — and worrying me — and —— That 's what it is , Mrs. Turner .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>TURNER<stage>not exactly knowing whether to believe this or not — probing the girl with her eyes</stage>Your father ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>Yes , all of them .<stage>Suddenly seeing a way to discredit all of the matron 's suspicions — excitedly .</stage>And principally the young man I 'm engaged to — the one who came to visit me several times ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>TURNER<stage>surprised</stage>So — you 're engaged ?<stage>Eileen nods . Mrs. Turner immediately dismisses her suspicions .</stage>Oh , pardon me . I did n't know that , you see , or I would n't ——<stage>She pats Eileen on the shoulder comfortingly .</stage>Never mind . You 'll tell me all about it , wo n't you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>desperately</stage>Yes .<stage>She seems about to go on , but the matron interrupts her .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>TURNER . Oh , not here , my dear . Now now . Come to my room — let me see — I 'll be busy all the morning — some time this afternoon . Will you do that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>Yes .<stage>Joyfully .</stage>Then I need n't go to bed right away ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>TURNER . No — on one condition . You must n't take any exercise . Stay in your recliner all day and rest and remain in bed to-morrow morning . And promise me you will rest and not worry any more about things we can easily fix up between us .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>I promise , Mrs. Turner .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>TURNER</l>
       <stage>smiling in dismissal</stage>
       <l>Very well , then . I must speak to</l>
       <l>Miss Bailey . I 'll see you this afternoon .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>Yes , Mrs. Turner .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>The matron goes to the rear where Miss Bailey is sitting with Mrs. Abner . She beckons to Miss Bailey , who gets up with a scared look , and they go to the far left corner of the room . Eileen stands for a moment hesitating — then starts to go to Murray , but just at this moment Peters comes forward and speaks to Murray .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PETERS</speaker>
      <p><stage>with his sly twisted grin</stage>Say , Carmody musta lost fierce . Did yuh see the Old Woman handin ’ her an earful ? Sent her back to bed , I betcha . What d'yuh think ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>impatiently , showing his dislike</stage>How the hell do I know ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PETERS</speaker>
      <p><stage>sneeringly</stage>Huh , you do n't know nothin ’ ‘ bout her , I s'pose ? Where d'yuh get that stuff ? Think yuh 're kiddin ’ me ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>with cold rage before which the other slinks away</stage>Peters , the more I see of you the better I like a skunk ! If it was n't for other people losing weight you could n't get any joy out of life , could you ?<stage>Roughly .</stage>Get away from me !<stage>He makes a threatening gesture .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PETERS</speaker>
      <p><stage>beating a snarling retreat</stage>Wait ‘ n ’ see if yuh do n't lose too , yuh stuck-up boob !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Seeing that Murray is alone again , Eileen starts towards him , but this time she is intercepted by Mrs. Abner , who stops on her way out . The weighing of the women is now finished , and that of the men , which proceeds much quicker , begins .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>STANTON</speaker>
      <p>Anderson !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Anderson comes to the scales . The men all move down to the left to wait their turn , with the exception of Murray , who remains by the dining-room door , fidgeting impatiently , anxious for a word with Eileen .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>ABNER<stage>taking Eileen 's arm</stage>Coming over to the cottage , dearie ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>Not just this minute , Mrs. Abner . I have to wait ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>ABNER . For the Old Woman ? You lost to-day , did n't you ? Is she sendin ’ you to bed , the old devil ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>Yes , I 'm afraid I 'll have to ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>ABNER . She 's a mean one , ai n't she ? I gained this week — half a pound . Lord , I 'm gittin ’ fat ! All my clothes are gittin ’ too small for me . Do n't know what I 'll do . Did you lose much , dearie ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>Three pounds .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>ABNER . Ai n't that awful !<stage>Hastening to make up for this thoughtless remark .</stage>All the same , what 's three pounds ! You can git them back in a week after you 're resting more . You been runnin ’ a temp , too , ai n't you ?<stage>Eileen nods .</stage>Do n't worry about it , dearie . It 'll go down . Worryin 's the worst . Me , I do n't never worry none .<stage>She chuckled with satisfaction — then soberly .</stage>I just been talkin ’ with Bailey . She 's got to go to bed , too , I guess . She lost two pounds . She ai n't runnin ’ no temp though .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>ABNER<stage>in a mysterious whisper</stage>Look at Mr. Murray , dearie . Ai n't he nervous to-day ? I do n't know as I blame him , either . I heard the doctor said he 'd let him go home if he gained to-day . Is it true , d'you know ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>dully</stage>I do n't know .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MRS</speaker>
      <p>ABNER . Gosh , I wish it was me ! My old man 's missin ’ me like the dickens , he writes .<stage>She starts to go .</stage>You 'll be over to the cottage in a while , wo n't you ? Me ‘ n ’ you 'll have a game of casino , eh ?</p>

     </sp>
     <stage>Mrs. Abner goes out . Eileen again starts towards Murray , but this time Flynn , a young fellow with a brick-coloured , homely , good-natured face , and a shaven-necked haircut , slouches back to Murray . Eileen is brought to a halt in front of the table where she stands , her face working with nervous strain , clasping and unclasping her trembling hands .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FLYNN</speaker>
      <p><stage>curiously</stage>Say , Steve , what 's this bull about the Doc lettin ’ yuh beat it if yuh gain to-day ? Is it straight goods ?</p>

      <speaker>FLYNN</speaker>
      <p>Make ‘ em believe . I wish Stanton 'd ask waivers on me .<stage>With a laugh .</stage>I oughter gain a ton to-day . I ate enough spuds for breakfast to plant a farm .</p>

     </sp>
     <stage>He starts to join Eileen , but Miss Bailey , who has finished her talk with Mrs. Turner , who goes out to the hall , approaches Eileen at just this moment . Murray stops in his tracks , fuming . He and Eileen exchange a glance of helpless annoyance .</stage>

     <stage>She disappears in the hallway . Murray strides over to Eileen , whose strength seems to have left her and who is leaning weakly against the table .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>Thank God — at last ! Is n't it hell — all these fools ! I could n't get to you . What did Old Lady Grundy have to say to you ? I saw her giving me a hard look .

     </sp>
     <stage>He goes to the scales . Eileen keeps her back turned . Her body stiffens rigidly in the intensity of her conflicting emotions . She stares straight ahead , her eyes full of anguish . Murray steps on the scales nervously . The balance rod hits the top smartly . He has gained . His face lights up and he heaves a great sigh of relief . Eileen seems to sense this outcome and her head sinks , her body sags weakly and seems to shrink to a smaller size . Murray gets off the scales , his face beaming with a triumphant smile . Doctor Stanton smiles and murmurs something to him in a low voice . Murray nods brightly ; then turns back to Eileen .</stage>

      <p><stage>trying to appear casual</stage>Well — three rousing cheers ! Stanton told me to come to his office at eleven . That means a final exam — and release !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>dully</stage>So you gained ?</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>Three pounds .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>Funny — I lost three .<stage>With a pitiful effort at a smile .</stage>I hope you gained the ones I lost .<stage>Her lips tremble .</stage>So you 're surely going away .</p>

      <p><stage>in a trembling whisper broken by rising sobs</stage>Oh — I 'm so glad — you gained — the ones I lost , Stephen —— So glad !<stage>She breaks down , covering her face with her hands , stifling her sobs .</stage></p>

     <stage>THE CURTAIN FALLS</stage>
    </div>
    <div type="scene" n="2">
     <head type="scene">Act Two : Scene Two</head>
     <stage type="setting">
      <stage>Midnight of the same day . A cross-road near the sanatorium . The main road comes down forward from the right . A smaller road , leading down from the left , joins it towards left centre .</stage>
      <stage>Dense woods rise sheer from the grass and bramble-grown ditches at the roadsides . At the junction of the two roads there is a signpost , its arms pointing towards the right and the left , rear . A pile of round stones is at the road corner , left forward . A full moon , riding high overhead , throws the roads into white , shadowless relief and masses the woods into walls of compact blackness . The trees lean heavily together , their branches motionless , unstirred by any trace of wind .</stage>
      <stage>As the curtain rises , Eileen is discovered standing in the middle of the road , front centre . Her face shows white and clear in the bright moonlight as she stares with anxious expectancy up the road to the left . Her body is fixed in an attitude of rigid immobility as if she were afraid the slightest movement would break the spell of silence and awaken the unknown . She has shrunk instinctively as far away as she can from the mysterious darkness which rises at the roadsides like an imprisoning wall . A sound of hurried footfalls , muffled by the dust , comes from the road she is watching . She gives a startled gasp . Her eyes strain to identify the oncomer . Uncertain , trembling with fright , she hesitates a second ; then darts to the side of the road and crouches down in the shadow .</stage>
      <stage>Stephen Murray comes down the road from the left . He stops by the signpost and peers about him . He wears a cap , the peak of which casts his face into shadow . Finally he calls in a low voice .</stage>
     </stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>Eileen !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>coming out quickly from her hiding-place — with a glad little cry</stage>Stephen ! At last !<stage>She runs to him as if she were going to fling her arms about him , but stops abashed . He reaches out and takes her hands .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>At last ? It can n't be twelve yet .<stage>He leads her to the pile of stones on the left .</stage>I have n't heard the village clock .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>I must have come early . It seemed as if I 'd been waiting for ages . I was so anxious ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>How your hands tremble ! Were you frightened ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>forcing a smile</stage>A little . The woods are so black — and queer-looking . I 'm all right now .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>Sit down . You must rest .<stage>In a tone of annoyed reproof .</stage>I 'm going to read you a lecture , young lady . You should n't ever have done this — running a temp and —— Good heavens , do n't you want to get well ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>dully</stage>I do n't know ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>irritably</stage>You make me ill when you talk that way , Eileen . It does n't sound like you at all . What 's come over you lately ? Get a grip on yourself , for God 's sake . I was — knocked out — when I read the note you slipped me after supper . I did n't get a chance to read it until late , I was so busy packing , and by that time you 'd gone to your cottage . If I could have reached you any way I 'd have refused to come here , I tell you straight . But I could n't — and I knew you 'd be here waiting — and — still , I feel guilty . Damn it , this is n't the thing for you ! You ought to be in bed asleep . Ca n't you look out for yourself ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>humbly</stage>Please , Stephen , do n't scold me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>How the devil did you ever get the idea — meeting me here at this ungodly hour ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>You 'd told me about your sneaking out that night to go to the village , and I thought there 'd be no harm this one night — the last night .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>But I 'm well . I 've been well . It 's different . You —— Honest ,</l>
       <l>Eileen , you should n't lose sleep and tax your strength .</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>Do n't scold me , please . I 'll make up for it . I 'll rest all the time — after you 're gone . I just had to see you some way — somewhere where there were n't eyes and ears on all sides — when you told me after dinner that Doctor Stanton had examined you and said you could go to-morrow ——<stage>A clock in the distant village begins striking .</stage>Sssh ! Listen .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>That 's twelve now . You see I was early .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>In a pause of silence they wait motionlessly until the last mournful note dies in the hushed woods .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>in a stifled voice</stage>It is n't to-morrow now , is it ? It 's to-day — the day you 're going .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>something in her voice making him avert his face and kick at the heap of stones on which she is sitting — brusquely</stage>Well , I hope you took precautions so you would n't be caught sneaking out .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>I did just what you 'd told me you did — stuffed the pillows under the clothes so the watchman would think I was there .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>None of the patients on your porch saw you leave , did they ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>No . They were all asleep .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>That 's all right , then . I would n't trust any of that bunch of women . They 'd be only too glad to squeal on you .<stage>There is an uncomfortable pause . Murray seems waiting for her to speak . He looks about him at the trees , up into the moonlit sky , breathing in the fresh air with a healthy delight . Eileen remains with downcast head , staring at the road .</stage>It 's beautiful to-night , is n't it ? Worth losing sleep for .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>dully</stage>Yes .<stage>Another pause — finally she murmurs faintly .</stage>Are you leaving early ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>The ten-forty . Leave the San at ten , I guess .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>You 're going home ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>Home ? You mean to the town ? No . But I 'm going to see my sisters — just to say hello . I 've got to , I suppose . I wo n't stay more than a few days , if I can help it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>I 'm sure — I 've often felt — you 're unjust to your sisters .<stage>With conviction .</stage>I 'm sure they must both love you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>frowning</stage>Maybe , in their own way . But what 's love without a glimmer of understanding — a nuisance ! They have never seen the real me and never have wanted to — that 's all .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>as if to herself</stage>What is — the real you ?<stage>Murray kicks at the stones impatiently without answering . Eileen hastens to change the subject .</stage>And then you 'll go to New York ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>interested , at once</stage>Yes . You bet .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>And write more ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>Not in New York , no . I 'm going there to take a vacation , and live , really enjoy myself for a while . I 've enough money for that as it is , and if the other stories you typed sell — I 'll be as rich as Rockefeller . I might even travel —— No , I 've got to make good with my best stuff first . I 'll save the travelling as a reward , a prize to gain . That 'll keep me at it . I know what I 'll do . When I 've had enough of New York , I 'll rent a place in the country — some old farmhouse — and live alone there and work .<stage>Lost in his own plans — with pleasure .</stage>That 's the right idea , is n't it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>trying to appear enthused</stage>It ought to be fine for your work .<stage>After a pause .</stage>They 're fine , those stories you wrote here . They 're — so much like you . I 'd know it was you wrote them even if — I did n't know .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>pleased</stage>Wait till you read the others I 'm going to do !<stage>After a slight pause — with a good-natured grin .</stage>Here I am talking about myself again ! Why do n't you call me down when I start that drivel ? But you do n't know how good it is to have your dreams coming true . It 'd make an egotist out of anyone .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>sadly</stage>No . I do n't know . But I love to hear you talk of yours .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>with an embarrassed laugh</stage>Thanks . Well , I 've certainly told you all of them . You 're the only one ——<stage>He stops and abruptly changes the subject .</stage>You said in your note that you had something important to tell me .<stage>He sits down beside her , crossing his legs .</stage>Is it about your interview with Old Mrs. Grundy this afternoon ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>No , that did n't amount to anything . She seemed mad because I told her so little . I think she guessed I only told her what I did so she 'd let me stay up , maybe — your last day ,— and to keep her from thinking what she did — about us .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>quickly , as if he wishes to avoid this subject</stage>What is it you wanted to tell me , then ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>sadly</stage>It does n't seem so important now , somehow . I suppose it was silly of me to drag you out here , just for that . It can n't mean anything to you — much .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>encouragingly</stage>How do you know it can n't ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>slowly</stage>I only thought — you might like to know .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>interestedly</stage>Know what ? What is it ? If I can help ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>No .<stage>After a moment 's hesitation .</stage>I wrote to him this afternoon .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>Him ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>The letter you 've been advising me to write .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>as if the knowledge of this alarmed him — haltingly</stage>You mean — Fred Nicholls ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>Yes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>after a pause — uncomfortably</stage>You mean — you broke it all off ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>Yes — for good .<stage>She looks up at his averted face . He remains silent . She continues apprehensively .</stage>You do n't say anything . I thought — you 'd be glad . You 've always told me it was the honourable thing to do .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>gruffly</stage>I know . I say more than my prayers , damn it !<stage>With sudden eagerness .</stage>Have you mailed the letter yet ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>Yes . Why ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>shortly</stage>Humph . Oh — nothing .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>with pained disappointment</stage>Oh , Stephen , you do n't think I did wrong , do you — now — after all you 've said ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>hurriedly</stage>Wrong ? No , not if you were convinced it was the right thing to do yourself — if you know you do n't love him . But I 'd hate to think you did it just on my advice . I should n't —— I did n't mean to interfere . I do n't know enough about your relations for my opinion to count .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>hurt</stage>You know all there is to know .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>I did n't mean — anything like that . I know you 've been frank . But him — I do n't know him . How could I , just meeting him once ? He may be quite different from my idea . That 's what I 'm getting at . I do n't want to be unfair to him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>bitterly scornful</stage>You need n't worry . You were n't unfair . And you need n't be afraid you were responsible for my writing . I 'd been going to for a long time before you ever spoke .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a relieved sigh</stage>I 'm glad of that — honestly , Eileen . I felt guilty . I should n't have knocked him behind his back without knowing him at all .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>You said you could read him like a book from his letters I showed you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>apologetically</stage>I know . I 'm a fool .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>angrily</stage>What makes you so considerate of Fred Nicholls all of a sudden ? What you thought about him was right .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>vaguely</stage>I do n't know . One makes mistakes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>assertively</stage>Well , I know ! You need n't waste pity on him . He 'll be only too glad to get my letter . He 's been anxious to be free of me ever since I was sent here , only he thought it would n't be decent to break it off himself while I was sick . He was afraid of what people would say about him when they found it out . So he 's just gradually stopped writing and coming for visits , and waited for me to realise . And if I did n't , I know he 'd have broken it off himself the first day I got home . I 've kept persuading myself that , in spite of the way he 's acted , he did love me as much as he could love anyone , and that it would hurt him if I —— But now I know that he never loved me , that he could n't love anyone but himself . Oh , I do n't hate him for it . He can n't help being what he is . And all people seem to be — like that , mostly . I 'm only going to remember that he and I grew up together , and that he was kind to me then when he thought he liked me — and forget all the rest .<stage>With agitated impatience .</stage>Oh , Stephen , you know all this I 've said about him . Why do n't you admit it ? You 've read his letters .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>haltingly</stage>Yes , I 'll admit that was my opinion — only I wanted to be sure you 'd found out for yourself .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>defiantly</stage>Well , I have ! You see that now , do n't you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p>Yes ; and I 'm glad you 're free of him , for your own sake . I knew he was n't the person .<stage>With an attempt at a joking tone .</stage>You must get one of the right sort — next time .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>springing to her feet with a cry of pain</stage>Stephen !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He avoids her eyes , which search his face pleadingly .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>mumbling</stage>He was n't good enough — to lace your shoes — nor anyone else , either .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a nervous laugh</stage>Do n't be silly .<stage>After a pause , during which she waits hungrily for some word from him — with a sigh of despair — faintly .</stage>Well , I 've told you — all there is . I might as well go back .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>not looking at her — indistinctly</stage>Yes . You must n't lose too much sleep . I 'll come to your cottage in the morning to say good-bye . They 'll permit that , I guess .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>stands looking at him imploringly , her face convulsed with anguish , but he keeps his eyes fixed on the rocks at his feet . Finally she seems to give up and takes a few uncertain steps up the road towards the right — in an exhausted whisper</stage>Good night , Stephen .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>his voice choked and husky</stage>Good night , Eileen .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>walks weakly up the road , but , as she passes the signpost , she suddenly stops and turns to look again at Murray , who has not moved or lifted his eyes . A great shuddering sob shatters her pent-up emotions . She runs back to Murray , her arms outstretched , with a choking cry</stage>Stephen !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>startled , whirls to face her and finds her arms thrown around his neck — in a terrified tone</stage>Eileen !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>brokenly</stage>I love you , Stephen — you ! That 's what I wanted to tell !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>She gazes up into his eyes , her face transfigured by the joy and pain of this abject confession .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>wincing as if this were the thing he had feared to hear</stage>Eileen !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>pulling down his head with fierce strength and kissing him passionately on the lips</stage>I love you ! I will say it ! There !<stage>With sudden horror .</stage>Oh , I know I should n't kiss you ! I must n't ! You 're all well — and I ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>protesting frenziedly</stage>Eileen ! Damn it ! Do n't say that ! What do you think I am !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>He kisses her fiercely two or three times until she forces a hand over her mouth .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>with a hysterically happy laugh</stage>No ! Just hold me in your arms — just a little while — before ——</p>

      <p><stage>between clinched teeth</stage>Yes — anything , Eileen !</p>

      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p>Then I want to say — I know your secret . You do n't love me — Is n't that it ?<stage>Murray groans .</stage>Sssh ! It 's all right , dear . You can n't help what you do n't feel . I 've guessed you did n't — right along . And I 've loved you — such a long time now — always , it seems . And you 've sort of guessed — that I did — did n't you ? No , do n't speak ! I 'm sure you 've guessed — only you did n't want to know — that — did you ?— when you did n't love me . That 's why you were lying — but I saw , I knew ! Oh , I 'm not blaming you , darling . How could I — never ! You must n't look so — so frightened . I know how you felt , dear . I 've — I 've watched you . It was just a flirtation for you at first . Was n't it ? Oh , I know . It was just fun , and —— Please do n't look at me so . I 'm not hurting you , am I ? I would n't for worlds , dear — you know — hurt you ! And then afterwards — you found we could be such good friends — helping each other — and you wanted it to stay just like that always , did n't you ?— I know — and then I had to spoil it all — and fall in love with you — did n't I ? Oh , it was stupid — I should n't — I could n't help it , you were so kind and — and different — and I wanted to share in your work and — and everything . I knew you would n't want to know I loved you — when you did n't — and I tried hard to be fair and hide my love so you would n't see — and I did , did n't I , dear ? You never knew till just lately — maybe not till just to-day — did you ?— when I knew you were going away so soon — and could n't help showing it . You never knew before , did you ? Did you ?</p>

      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>miserably</stage>No . Oh , Eileen — Eileen , I 'm so sorry !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>in heart-broken protest</stage>Sorry ? Oh , no , Stephen , you must n't be ! It 's been beautiful — all of it — for me ! That 's what makes your going — so hard . I had to see you to-night — I 'd have gone — crazy — if I did n't know you knew , if I had n't made you guess . And I thought — if you knew about my writing to Fred — that — maybe — it 'd make some difference .<stage>Murray groans — and she laughs hysterically .</stage>I must have been crazy — to think that — must n't I ? As if that could — when you do n't love me . Sshh ! Please ! Let me finish . You must n't feel sad — or anything . It 's made me happier than I 've ever been — loving you — even when I did know — you did n't . Only now — you 'll forgive me telling you all this , wo n't you , dear ? Now , it 's so terrible to think I wo n't see you any more . I 'll feel so — without anybody .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
      <p><stage>brokenly</stage>But I 'll — come back . And you 'll be out soon — and then ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>brokenly</stage>Sshh ! Let me finish . You do n't know how alone I am now . Father — he 'll marry that housekeeper — and the children — they 've forgotten me . None of them need me any more . They 've found out how to get on without me — and I 'm a drag — dead to them — no place for me home any more — and they 'll be afraid to have me back — afraid of catching — I know she wo n't want me back . And Fred — he 's gone — he never mattered , anyway . Forgive me , dear — worrying you — only I want you to know how much you 've meant to me — so you wo n't forget — ever — after you 've gone .</p>

      <p>I know — you like me a lot even if you can n't love me — do n't you ?<stage>His arms tighten about her as he bends down and forces a kiss on her lips again .</stage>Oh , Stephen ! That was for good-bye . You must n't come to-morrow morning . I could n't bear having you — with people watching . But you 'll write after — often — wo n't you ?<stage>Heart-brokenly .</stage>Oh , please do that , Stephen !</p>

      <p>I will ! I swear ! And when you get out I 'll — we 'll — I 'll find something .<stage>He kisses her again .</stage></p>

    <head type="act">Act Three</head>
    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>Four months later . An isolation room at the Infirmary with a sleeping porch at the right of it . Late afternoon of a Sunday towards the end of October . The room , extending two-thirds of the distance from left to right , is , for reasons of space economy , scantily furnished with the bare necessities — a bureau with mirror in the left corner , rear — two straight-backed chairs — a table with a glass top in the centre . The floor is varnished hardwood . The walls and furniture are painted white . On the left , forward , a door to the hall . On the right , rear , a double glass door opening on the porch . Farther front two windows . The porch , a screened-in continuation of the room , contains only a single iron bed , painted white , and a small table placed beside the bed .</stage>
     <stage>The woods , the leaves of the trees rich in their autumn colouring , rise close about this side of the Infirmary . Their branches almost touch the porch on the right . In the rear of the porch they have been cleared away from the building for a narrow space , and through this opening the distant hills can be seen with the tree tops glowing in the sunlight .</stage>
     <stage>As the curtain rises , Eileen is discovered lying in the bed on the porch , propped up into a half-sitting position by pillows under her back and head . She seems to have grown much thinner . Her face is pale and drawn , with deep hollows under her cheek-bones . Her eyes are dull and lustreless . She gazes straight before her into the wood with the unseeing stare of apathetic indifference . The door from the hall in the room behind her is opened , and Miss Howard enters , followed by Bill Carmody , Mrs. Brennan , and Mary . Carmody 's manner is unwontedly sober and subdued . This air of respectable sobriety is further enhanced by a black suit , glaringly new and stiffly pressed , a new black derby hat , and shoes polished like a mirror . His expression is full of a bitter , if suppressed , resentment . His gentility is evidently forced upon him in spite of himself and correspondingly irksome . Mrs. Brennan is a tall , stout woman of fifty , lusty and loud-voiced , with a broad , snub-nosed , florid face , a large mouth , the upper lip darkened by a suggestion of moustache , and little round blue eyes , hard and restless with a continual fuming irritation . She is got up regardless in her ridiculous Sunday-best . Mary appears tall and skinny-legged in a starched , outgrown frock . The sweetness of her face has disappeared , giving way to a hang-dog sullenness , a stubborn silence , with sulky , furtive glances of rebellion directed at her step-mother .</stage>

     <speaker>MISS HOWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>pointing to the porch</stage>She 's out there on the porch .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>BRENNAN<stage>with dignity</stage>Thank you , ma'am .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS HOWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>with a searching glance at the visitors as if to appraise their intentions</stage>Eileen 's been very sick lately , you know , so be careful not to worry her about anything . Do your best to cheer her up .</p>

     <p><stage>mournfully</stage>We 'll try to put life in her spirits , God help her .<stage>With an uncertain look at Mrs. Brennan .</stage>Wo n't we , Maggie ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>BRENNAN<stage>turning sharply on Mary , who has gone over to examine the things on the bureau</stage>Come away from that , Mary . Curiosity killed a cat . Do n't be touchin ’ her things . Remember what I told you . Or is it admirin ’ your mug in the mirror you are ?<stage>Turning to Miss Howard as Mary moves away from the bureau , hanging her head — shortly .</stage>Do n't you worry , ma'am . We wo n't trouble Eileen at all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS HOWARD</speaker>
     <p>Another thing . You must n't say anything to her of what Miss Gilpin just told you about her being sent away to the State Farm in a few days . Eileen is n't to know till the very last minute . It would only disturb her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
     <p><stage>hastily</stage>We 'll not say a word of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS HOWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>turning to the hall door</stage>Thank you .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She goes out , shutting the door .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>BRENNAN<stage>angrily</stage>She has a lot of impudent gab , that one , with her do n't do this and do n't do that ! It 's a wonder you would n't speak up to her and shut her mouth , you great fool , and you payin ’ money to give her her job .<stage>Disgustedly .</stage>You 've no guts in you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
     <p><stage>placatingly</stage>Would you have me raisin ’ a shindy when Eileen 's leavin ’ here in a day or more ? What 'd be the use ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>BRENNAN . In the new place she 's goin ’ you 'll not have to pay a cent , and that 's a blessing ! It 's small good they 've done her here for all the money they 've taken .<stage>Gazing about the room critically .</stage>It 's neat and clean enough ; and why should n't it , a tiny room and the lot of them nothing to do all day but scrub .<stage>Scornfully .</stage>Two sticks of chairs and a table ! They do n't give much for the money .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
     <p>Catch them ! It 's a good thing she 's clearin ’ out of this , and her worse off after them curin ’ her eight months than she was when she came . She 'll maybe get well in the new place .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>BRENNAN<stage>indifferently</stage>It 's God 's will , what 'll happen .<stage>Irritably .</stage>And I 'm thinkin ’ it 's His punishment she 's under now for having no heart in her and never writin ’ home a word to you or the children in two months or more . If the doctor had n't wrote us himself to come see her , she was sick , we 'd have been no wiser .</p>

     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p><stage>who has drifted to one of the windows at right — curiously</stage>There 's somebody in bed out there . I can n't see her face . Is it Eileen ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>BRENNAN . Do n't be goin ’ out there till I tell you , you imp ! I must speak to your father first .<stage>Coming closer to him and lowering her voice .</stage>Are you going to tell her about it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
     <p><stage>pretending ignorance</stage>About what ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>BRENNAN . About what , indeed ! Do n't pretend you do n't know . About our marryin ’ two weeks back , of course . What else ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
     <p><stage>uncertainly</stage>Yes — I disremembered she did n't know . I 'll have to tell her , surely .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>BRENNAN<stage>flaring up</stage>You speak like you would n't . Is it shamed of me you are ? Are you afraid of a slip of a girl ? Well , then , I 'm not ! I 'll tell her to her face soon enough .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
     <p><stage>angry in his turn — assertively</stage>You 'll not , now ! Keep your mouth out of this and your rough tongue ! I tell you I 'll tell her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>BRENNAN<stage>satisfied</stage>Let 's be going out to her , then .<stage>They move towards the door to the porch .</stage>And keep your eye on your watch . We must n't miss the train . Come with us , Mary , and remember to keep your mouth shut .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>They go out on the porch and stand just outside the door waiting for Eileen to notice them ; but the girl in bed continues to stare into the woods , oblivious to their presence .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>BRENNAN<stage>nudging Carmody with her elbow — in a harsh whisper</stage>She do n't see us . It 's a dream she 's in with her eyes open . Glory be , it 's bad she 's lookin ’ . The look on her face 'd frighten you . Speak to her , you !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Eileen stirs uneasily as if this whisper had disturbed her unconsciously .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
     <p><stage>wetting his lips and clearing his throat huskily</stage>Eileen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>startled , turns and stares at them with frightened eyes . After a pause she ventures uncertainly , as if she were not sure hut what these figures might be creatures of her dream</stage>Father .<stage>Her eyes shift to Mrs. Brennan 's face and she shudders .</stage>Mrs. Brennan .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>BRENNAN<stage>quickly — in a voice meant to be kindly</stage>Here we are , all of us , come to see you . How is it you 're feelin ’ now , Eileen ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>While she is talking she advances to the bedside , followed by Carmody , and takes one of the sick girl 's hands in hers . Eileen withdraws it as if stung and holds it out to her father . Mrs. Brennan 's face flushes angrily and she draws back from the bedside .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
     <p><stage>moved — with rough tenderness patting her hand</stage>Ah , Eileen , sure it 's a sight for sore eyes to see you again !<stage>He bends down as if to kiss her , but , struck by a sudden fear , hesitates , straightens himself , and shamed by the understanding in Eileen 's eyes , grows red and stammers confusedly .</stage>How are you now ? Sure it 's the picture of health you 're lookin ’ .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Eileen sighs and turns her eyes away from him with a resigned sadness .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>BRENNAN . What are you standin ’ there for like a stick , Mary ? Have n't you a word to say to your sister ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>twisting her head around and seeing Mary for the first time — with a glad cry</stage>Mary ! I — why , I did n't see you before ! Come here .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Mary approaches gingerly with apprehensive side glances at Mrs. Brennan , who watches her grimly . Eileen 's arms reach out for her hungrily . She grasps her about the waist and seems trying to press the unwilling child to her breast .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARY</speaker>
     <p><stage>fidgeting nervously — suddenly in a frightened whine</stage>Let me go !<stage>Eileen releases her , looks at her face dazedly for a second , then falls back limply with a little moan and shuts her eyes . Mary , who has stepped back a pace , remains fixed there as if fascinated with fright by her sister 's face . She stammers .</stage>Eileen — you look so — so funny .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>without opening her eyes — in a dead voice</stage>You , too ! I never thought you —— Go away , please .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>BRENNAN<stage>with satisfaction</stage>Come here to me , Mary , and do n't be botherin ’ your sister .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Mary avoids her step-mother , but retreats to the far end of the porch where she stands shrunk back against the wall , her eyes fixed on Eileen with the same fascinated horror .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
     <p><stage>after an uncomfortable pause , forcing himself to speak</stage>Is the pain bad , Eileen ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>dully — without opening her eyes</stage>There 's no pain .<stage>There is another pause — then she murmurs indifferently .</stage>There are chairs in the room you can bring out if you want to sit down .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>BRENNAN<stage>sharply</stage>We 've not time to be sittin ’ . We 've the train back to catch .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>in the same lifeless voice</stage>It 's a disagreeable trip . I 'm sorry you had to come .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
     <p><stage>fighting against an oppression he cannot understand , bursts into a flood of words</stage>Do n't be talking of the trip . Sure we 're glad to take it to get a sight of you . It 's three months since I 've had a look at you , and I was anxious . Why have n't you written a line to us ? You could do that without trouble , surely . Do n't you ever think of us at all any more ?<stage>He waits for an answer , but Eileen remains silent with her eyes closed . Carmody starts to walk up and down , talking with an air of desperation .</stage>You 're not asking a bit of news from home . I 'm thinkin ’ the people out here have taken all the thought of us out of your head . We 're all well , thank God . I 've another good job on the streets from Murphy and one that 'll last a long time , praise be ! I 'm needin ’ it surely , with all the expenses — but no matter . Billy had a raise from his old skinflint of a boss a month back . He 's gettin ’ seven a week now and proud as a turkey . He was comin ’ out with us to-day , but he 'd a date with his girl . Sure , he 's got a girl now , the young bucko ! What d'you think of him ? It 's old Malloy 's girl he 's after — the pop-eyed one with glasses , you remember — as ugly as a blind sheep , only he do n't think so . He said to give you his love .<stage>Eileen stirs and sighs wearily , a frown appearing for an instant on her forehead .</stage>And Tom and Nora was comin ’ out too , but Father Fitz had some doin 's or other up to the school , and he told them to be there , so they would n't come with us , but they sent their love to you , too . They 're growin ’ so big you 'd not know them . Tom 's no good at the school . He 's like Billy was . I 've had to take the strap to him often . He 's always playin ’ hooky and roamin ’ the streets . And Nora .<stage>With pride .</stage>There 's the divil for you ! Up to everything she is and no holdin ’ her high spirits . As pretty as a picture , and the smartest girl in her school , Father Fitz says . Am I lyin ’ , Maggie ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>BRENNAN<stage>grudgingly</stage>She 's smart enough — and too free with her smartness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
     <p><stage>pleased</stage>Ah , do n't be talkin ’ ! She 'll know more than the lot of us before she 's grown even .<stage>He pauses in his walk and stares down at Eileen , frowning .</stage>Are you sick , Eileen , that you 're keepin ’ your eyes shut without a word out of you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>wearily</stage>No . I 'm tired , that 's all .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
     <p><stage>resuming his walk</stage>And who else is there , let me think ? Oh , Mary — she 's the same as ever , you can see for yourself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>bitterly</stage>The same ? Oh , no !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
     <p>She 's grown , you mean ? I suppose . You 'd notice , not seeing her so long ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He can think of nothing else to say , but walks up and down with a restless , uneasy expression .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>

     <p>Two weeks back we were , by Father Fitz .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He stands staring down at his daughter , irritated , perplexed and confounded by her silence , looking as if he longed to shake her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>BRENNAN<stage>angry at the lack of enthusiasm shown by Eileen</stage>Let us get out of this , Bill . We 're not wanted , that 's plain as the nose on your face . It 's little she 's caring about you , and little thanks she has for all you 've done for her and the money you 've spent .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
     <p><stage>with a note of pleading</stage>Is that a proper way to be treatin ’ your father , Eileen , after what I 've told you ? Have you no heart in you at all ? Is it nothin ’ to you you 've a good , kind woman now for mother ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>fiercely , her eyes flashing open on him</stage>No , no ! Never !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>BRENNAN<stage>plucking at Carmody 's elbow . He stands looking at Eileen helplessly , his mouth open , a guilty flush spreading over his face</stage>Come out of here , you big fool , you ! Is it to listen to insults to your livin ’ wife you 're waiting ? Am I to be tormented and you never raise a hand to stop her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
     <p><stage>turning on her threateningly</stage>Will you shut your gab ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>with a moan</stage>Oh , go away , Father ! Please ! Take her away !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>BRENNAN<stage>pulling at his arm</stage>Take me away this second or I 'll go on without you and never speak again to you till the day I die !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
     <p><stage>pushes her violently away from him — his fist uplifted</stage>Shut your gab , I 'm saying !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>BRENNAN . The divil mend you and yours then ! I 'm leavin ’ you .<stage>She starts for the door .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
     <p><stage>hastily</stage>Wait a bit , Maggie . I 'm comin ’ .<stage>She goes into the room , slamming the door , but once inside she stands still , trying to listen . Carmody glares down at his daughter 's pale twitching face with the closed eyes . Finally he croaks in a whining tone of fear .</stage>Is your last word a cruel one to me this day , Eileen ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She remains silent . His face darkens . He turns and strides out of the door . Mary darts after him with a frightened cry of “ Papa . ” Eileen covers her face with her hands and a shudder of relief runs over her body .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS</speaker>
     <p>BRENNAN<stage>as Carmody enters the room — in a mollified tone</stage>So you 've come , have you ? Let 's go , then ?<stage>Carmody stands looking at her in silence , his expression full of gloomy rage . She bursts out impatiently .</stage>Are you comin ’ or are you goin ’ back to her ?<stage>She grabs Mary 's arm and pushes her towards , the door to the hall .</stage>Are you comin ’ or not , I 'm askin ’ ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CARMODY</speaker>
     <p><stage>sombrely — as if to himself</stage>There 's something wrong in the whole of this — that I can n't make out .<stage>With sudden fury he brandishes his fists as though defying someone and growls threateningly .</stage>And I 'll get drunk this night — dead , rotten drunk !<stage>He seems to detect disapproval in Mrs. Brennan 's face , for he shakes his fist at her and repeats like a solemn oath .</stage>I 'll get drunk this night , I 'm sayin ’ ! I 'll get drunk if my soul roasts for it — and no one in the whole world is strong enough to stop me !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Mrs. Brennan turns from him with a disgusted shrug of her shoulders and hustles Mary out of the door . Carmody , after a second 's pause , follows them . Eileen lies still , looking out into the woods with empty , desolate eyes . Miss Howard comes into the room from the hall and goes to the porch , carrying a glass of milk in her hand .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS HOWARD</speaker>
     <p>Here 's your diet , Eileen . I forgot it until just now . Sundays are awful days , are n't they ? They get me all mixed up in my work , with all these visitors around . Did you have a nice visit with your folks ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>forcing a smile</stage>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS HOWARD</speaker>
     <p>You look worn out . I hope they did n't worry you over home affairs ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She sips her milk and sets it back on the table with a shudder of disgust .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS HOWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>with a smile</stage>What a face ! You 'd think you were taking poison .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p>I hate it !<stage>With deep passion .</stage>I wish it was poison !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS HOWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>jokingly</stage>Oh , come now ! That is n't a nice way to feel on the Sabbath .<stage>With a meaning smile .</stage>I 've some news that 'll cheer you up , I bet .<stage>Archly .</stage>Guess who 's here on a visit ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>startled — in a frightened whisper</stage>Who ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS HOWARD</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Murray .<stage>Eileen closes her eyes wincingly for a moment and a shadow of pain comes over her face .</stage>He just came about the time your folks did . I saw him for a moment , not to speak to . He was going to the main building — to see Doctor Stanton , I suppose .<stage>Beaming — with a certain curiosity .</stage>What do you think of that for news ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>trying to conceal her agitation and assume a casual tone</stage>He must have come to be examined .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS HOWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>with a meaning laugh</stage>Oh , I 'd hardly say that was his main reason . He does look much thinner and very tired , though . I suppose he 's been working too hard .<stage>In business-like tones .</stage>Well , I 've got to get back on the job .<stage>She turns to the door calling back jokingly .</stage>He 'll be in to see you , of course , so look your prettiest .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She goes out and shuts the door to the porch . Eileen gives a frightened gasp and struggles up in bed as if she wanted to call the nurse to return . Then she lies back in a state of great nervous excitement , twisting her head with eager , fearful glances towards the door , listening , clasping and unclasping her thin fingers on the white spread . As Miss Howard walks across the room to the hall door , it is opened and Stephen Murray enters . A great change is visible in his face . It is much thinner and the former healthy tan has faded to a sallow pallor . Puffy shadows of sleeplessness and dissipation are marked under his heavy-lidded eyes . He is dressed in a well-fitting , expensive dark suit , a white shirt with a soft collar and bright-coloured tie .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS HOWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>with pleased surprise , holding out her hand</stage>Hello , Mr. Murray .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>shaking her hand — with a forced pleasantness</stage>How are you , Miss Howard ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS HOWARD</speaker>
     <p>Fine as ever . It certainly looks natural to see you around here again — not that I hope you 're here to stay , though .<stage>With a smile .</stage>I suppose you 're on your way to Eileen now . Well , I wo n't keep you . I 've stacks of work to do .<stage>She opens the hall door . He starts for the porch .</stage>Oh , I was forgetting — Congratulations ! I 've read those stories — all of us have . They 're great . We 're all so proud of you . You 're one of our graduates , you know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>indifferently</stage>Oh ,— that stuff .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS HOWARD</speaker>
     <p><stage>gaily</stage>Do n't be so modest . Well , see you later , I hope .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p>Yes . Doctor Stanton invited me to stay for supper and I may ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS HOWARD</speaker>
     <p>Fine ! Be sure to !</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>She goes out . Murray walks to porch door and steps out . He finds Eileen 's eyes waiting for him . As their eyes meet she gasps involuntarily and he stops short in his tracks . For a moment they remain looking at each other in silence .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>dropping her eyes — faintly</stage>Stephen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>much moved , strides to her bedside and takes her hands awkwardly</stage>Eileen .<stage>Then after a second 's pause , in which he searches her face and is shocked by the change illness has made — anxiously .</stage>How are you feeling , Eileen ?<stage>He grows confused by her gaze and his eyes shift from hers , which search his face with wild yearning .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>forcing a smile</stage>Oh , I 'm all right .<stage>Eagerly .</stage>But you , Stephen ? How are you ?<stage>Excitedly .</stage>Oh , it 's good to see you again !<stage>Her eyes continue fixed on his face pleadingly , questioningly .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>haltingly</stage>And it 's sure great to see you again , Eileen .<stage>He releases her hand and turns away .</stage>And I 'm fine and dandy . I look a little done up , I guess , but that 's only the result of too much New York .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Eileen , sensing from his manner that whatever she has hoped for from his visit is not to be , sinks back on the pillows , shutting her eyes hopelessly , and cannot control a sigh of pain .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>turning to her anxiously</stage>What 's the matter , Eileen ? You 're not in pain , are you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>wearily</stage>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p>You have n't been feeling badly lately , have you ? Your letters suddenly stopped — not a line for the past three weeks — and I ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>bitterly</stage>I got tired of writing and never getting any answer , Stephen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>shame-faced</stage>Come , Eileen , it was n't as bad as that . You 'd think I never — and I did write , did n't I ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p>Right after you left here , you did , Stephen . Lately ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sorry , Eileen . It was n't that I did n't mean to — but — in New York it 's so hard . You start to do one thing and something else interrupts you . You never seem to get any one thing done when it ought to be . You can understand that , can n't you , Eileen ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>sadly</stage>Yes . I understand everything now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>offended</stage>What do you mean by everything ? You said that so strangely . You mean you do n't believe ——<stage>But she remains silent with her eyes shut . He frowns and takes to pacing up and down beside the bed .</stage>Why have they got you stuck out here on this isolation porch , Eileen ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>dully</stage>There was no room on the main porch , I suppose .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p>You never mentioned in any of your letters ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p>It 's not very cheerful to get letters full of sickness . I would n't like to , I know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>hurt</stage>That is n't fair , Eileen . You know I —— How long have you been back in the Infirmary ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p>About a month .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>shocked</stage>A month ! But you were up and about — on exercise , were n't you — before that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p>No . I had to stay in bed while I was at the cottage .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p>You mean — ever since that time they sent you back — the day before I left ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p>But I thought from the cheery tone of your letters that you were ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>uneasily</stage>Getting better ? I am , Stephen . I 'm strong enough to be up now , but Doctor Stanton wants me to take a good long rest this time so that when I do get up again I 'll be sure ——<stage>She breaks off impatiently .</stage>But do n't let 's talk about it . I 'm all right .<stage>Murray glances down at her face worriedly . She changes the subject .</stage>You 've been over to see Doctor Stanton , have n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p>Did he examine you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p>Yes .<stage>Carelessly .</stage>Oh , he found me O. K . I 'm fine and dandy , as I said before .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p>I 'm glad , Stephen .<stage>After a pause .</stage>Tell about yourself — what you 've been doing . You 've written a lot lately , have n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>frowning</stage>No . I have n't been able to get down to it — somehow . There 's so little time to yourself once you get to know people in New York . The sale of the stories you typed put me on easy street as far as money goes , so I 've felt no need ——<stage>He laughs weakly .</stage>I guess I 'm one of those who have to get down to hard pan before they get the kick to drive them to hard work .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>surprised</stage>Was it hard work writing them up here ? You used to seem so happy just in doing them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p>I was — happier than I 've been before or afterwards .<stage>Cynically .</stage>But — I do n't know — it was a new game to me then and I was chuck full of illusions about the glory of it .<stage>He laughs half-heartedly .</stage>Now I 'm hardly a bit more enthusiastic over it than I used to be over newspaper work . It 's like everything else , I guess . When you 've got it , you find you do n't want it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>looking at him wonderingly — disturbed</stage>But is n't just the writing itself worth while ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>as if suddenly ashamed of himself — quickly</stage>Yes . Of course it is . I 'm talking like a fool . I 'm sore at everything because I 'm dissatisfied with my own cussedness and laziness — and I want to pass the buck .<stage>With a smile of cheerful confidence .</stage>It 's only a fit . I 'll come out of it all right and get down to brass tacks again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>with an encouraging smile</stage>That 's the way you ought to feel . It 'd be wrong — I 've read the two stories that have come out so far over and over . They 're fine , I think . Every line in them sounds like you , and at the same time sounds natural and like people and things you see every day . Everybody thinks they 're fine , Stephen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>pleased , but pretending cynicism</stage>Then they must be rotten .<stage>Then with self-assurance .</stage>Well , I 've plenty more of those stories in my head . Every time I think of my home town there seems to be a new story in someone I 've known there .<stage>Spiritedly .</stage>Oh , I 'll pound them out some time when the spirit moves ; and I 'll make them so much better than what I 've done so far , you wo n't recognise them . I feel it 's in me to do it .<stage>Smiling .</stage>Darn it , do you know just talking about it makes me feel as if I could sit right down now and start in on one . Is it the fact I 've worked here before — or is it seeing you , Eileen .<stage>Gratefully .</stage>I really believe it 's you . I have n't forgotten how you helped me before .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>in a tone of pain</stage>Do n't , Stephen . I did n't do anything .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>eagerly</stage>Yes , you did . You made it possible . I can n't tell you what a help you were . And since I 've left the San , I 've looked forward to your letters to boost up my spirits . When I felt down in the mouth over my own idiocy , I used to re-read them , and they always were good medicine . I can n't tell you how grateful I 've felt , honestly !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>faintly</stage>You 're kind to say so , Stephen — but it was nothing , really .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p>And I can n't tell you how I 've missed those letters for the past three weeks . They left a big hole in things . I was worried about you — not having heard a word .<stage>With a smile .</stage>So I came to look you up .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>faintly . Forcing an answering smile</stage>Well , you see now I 'm all right .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>concealing his doubt</stage>Yes , of course you are . Only I 'd a darn sight rather see you up and about . We could take a walk , then — through the woods .<stage>A wince of pain shadows Eileen 's face . She closes her eyes . Murray continues softly , after a pause .</stage>You have n't forgotten that last night — out there — Eileen ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>her lips trembling — trying to force a laugh</stage>Please do n't remind me of that , Stephen . I was so silly and so sick , too . My temp was so high it must have made me — completely crazy — or I 'd never dreamed of doing such a stupid thing . My head must have been full of wheels because I do n't remember anything I did or said , hardly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>his pride taken down a peg by this — in a hurt tone</stage>Oh ! Well — I have n't forgotten and I never will , Eileen .<stage>Then his face clears up as if a weight had been taken off his conscience .</stage>Well — I rather thought you would n't take it seriously — afterwards . You were all up in the air that night . And you never mentioned it in your letters ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>pleadingly</stage>Do n't talk about it ! Forget it ever happened . It makes me feel —<stage>with a half-hysterical laugh</stage>— like a fool !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>worried</stage>All right , Eileen . I wo n't . Do n't get worked up over nothing . That is n't resting , you know .<stage>Looking down at her closed eyes — solicitously .</stage>Perhaps all my talking has tired you out ? Do you feel done up ? Why do n't you try and take a nap now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>dully</stage>Yes , I 'd like to sleep .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>clasps her hands gently</stage>I 'll leave you then , I 'll drop back to say good-bye and stay awhile before I go . I wo n't leave until the last train .<stage>As she does n't answer .</stage>Do you hear , Eileen ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>weakly</stage>Yes . You 'll come back — to say good-bye .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p>Yes . I 'll be back sure .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>He presses her hand and after a kindly glance of sympathy down at her face , tiptoes to the door and goes into the room , shutting the door behind him . When she hears the door shut Eileen struggles up in bed and stretches her arms after him with an agonised sob “ Stephen ! ” She hides her face in her hands and sobs brokenly . Murray walks across to the hall door and is about to go out when the door is opened and Miss Gilpin enters .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>hurriedly</stage>How do you do , Mr. Murray . Doctor Stanton just told me you were here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>as they shake hands — smiling</stage>How are you , Miss Gilpin ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
     <p>He said he 'd examined you , and that you were O. K . I 'm glad .<stage>Glancing at him keenly .</stage>You 've been talking to Eileen ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p>Just left her this second . She wanted to sleep for a while .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>wonderingly</stage>Sleep ?<stage>Then hurriedly .</stage>It 's too bad . I wish I 'd known you were here sooner . I wanted very much to talk to you before you saw Eileen . You see , I knew you 'd pay us a visit some time .<stage>With a worried smile .</stage>I still think I ought to have a talk with you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p>Certainly , Miss Gilpin .</p>
    </sp>

     <p><stage>takes a chair and places it near the hall door</stage>Sit down . She can n't hear us here . Goodness knows this is hardly the place for confidences , but there are visitors all over and it 'll have to do . Did you close the door tightly ? She must n't hear me above all .<stage>She goes to the porch door and peeps out for a moment ; then comes back to him with flashing eyes .</stage>She 's crying ! What have you been saying to her ? Oh , it 's too late , I know ! The fools should n't have permitted you to see her before I —— What has happened out there ? Tell me ! I must know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>stammering</stage>Happened ? Nothing . She 's crying ? Why , Miss Gilpin — you know I would n't hurt her for worlds .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>more calmly</stage>Intentionally . I know you would n't . But something has happened .<stage>Then briskly .</stage>We 're talking at cross purposes . Since you do n't seem inclined to confide in me , I 'll have to in you . You noticed how badly she looks , did n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I did .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>gravely</stage>She 's been going down hill steadily —<stage>meaningly</stage>— ever since you left . She 's in a very serious state , let me impress you with that . We 've all loved her , and felt so sorry for her and admired her spirit so — that 's the only reason she 's been allowed to stay here so long after her time . We 've kept hoping she 'd start to pick up — in another day — in another week . But now that 's all over . Doctor Stanton has given up hope of her improving here , and her father is unwilling to pay for her elsewhere now he knows there 's a cheaper place — the State Farm . So she 's to be sent there in a day or so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>springing to his feet — horrified</stage>To the State Farm !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
     <p>Her time here is long past . You know the rule — and she is n't getting better .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>appalled</stage>That means ——!</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>forcibly</stage>Death ! That 's what it means for her !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>stunned</stage>Good God , I never dreamed ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
     <p>With others it might be different . They might improve under changed surroundings . In her case , it 's certain . She 'll die . And it would n't do any good to keep her here , either . She 'd die here . She 'll die anywhere . She 'll die because lately she 's given up hope , she has n't wanted to live any more . She 's let herself go — and now it 's too late .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p>Too late ? You mean there 's no chance — now ?<stage>Miss Gilpin nods . Murray is overwhelmed — after a pause — stammering .</stage>Is n't there — anything — we can do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>sadly</stage>I do n't know . I should have talked to you before you —— You see , she 's seen you now . She knows .<stage>As he looks mystified she continues slowly .</stage>I suppose you know that Eileen loves you , do n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>as if defending himself against an accusation — with confused alarm</stage>No — Miss Gilpin . You 're wrong , honestly . She may have felt something like that — once — but that was long ago before I left the San . She 's forgotten all about it since , I know she has .<stage>Miss Gilpin smiles bitterly .</stage>Why , she never even alluded to it in any of her letters — all these months .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
     <p>Did you in yours ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p>No , of course not . You do n't understand . Why — just now — she said that part of it had all been so silly she felt she 'd acted like a fool and did n't ever want to be reminded of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
     <p>She saw that you did n't love her — any more than you did in the days before you left . Oh , I used to watch you then . I sensed what was going on between you . I would have stopped it then out of pity for her , if I could have , if I did n't know that any interference would only make matters worse . And then I thought that it might be only a surface affair — that after you were gone it would end for her .<stage>She sighs — then after a pause .</stage>You 'll have to forgive me for speaking to you so boldly on a delicate subject . But , do n't you see , it 's for her sake . I love Eileen . We all do .<stage>Averting her eyes from his — in a low voice .</stage>I know how Eileen feels , Mr. Murray . Once — a long time ago — I suffered as she is suffering — from this same mistake . But I had resources to fall back upon that Eileen has n't got — a family who loved me and understood — friends — so I pulled through . But it spoiled my life for a long time .<stage>Looking at him again and forcing a smile .</stage>So I feel that perhaps I have a right to speak for Eileen who has no one else .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>huskily — much moved</stage>Say anything to me you like , Miss Gilpin .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>after a pause — sadly</stage>You do n't love her — do you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p>No — I — I do n't believe I 've ever thought much of loving anyone — that way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>sadly</stage>Oh , it 's too late , I 'm afraid . If we had only had this talk before you had seen her ! I meant to talk to you frankly and if I found out you did n't love Eileen — there was always the forlorn hope that you might — I was going to tell you not to see her , for her sake — not to let her face the truth . For I am sure she continued to hope in spite of everything , and always would — to the end — if she did n't see you . I was going to implore you to stay away , to write her letters that would encourage her hope , and in that way she would never learn the truth . I thought of writing you all this — but — it 's so delicate a matter — I did n't have the courage .<stage>With intense grief .</stage>And now Doctor Stanton 's decision to send her away makes everything doubly hard . When she knows that — she will throw everything that holds her to life — out of the window ! And think of it — her dying there alone !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>very pale</stage>Do n't ! That sha n't happen . I can at least save her from that . I have money enough — I 'll make more — to send her to any place you think ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
     <p>That is something — but it does n't touch the source of her unhappiness . If there were only some way to make her happy in the little time that is left to her ! She has suffered so much through you . Oh , Mr. Murray , can n't you tell her you love her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>after a pause — slowly</stage>But she 'll never believe me , I 'm afraid , now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>eagerly</stage>But you must make her believe ! And you must ask her to marry you . If you 're engaged it will give you the right in her eyes to take her away . You can take her to some private San . There 's a small place , but a very good one , at White Lake . It 's not too expensive , and it 's a beautiful spot , out of the world , and you can live and work near by . And she 'll be happy to the very last . Do n't you think that 's something — the best you have — the best you can give in return for her love for you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>slowly — deeply moved</stage>Yes .<stage>Then determinedly .</stage>But I wo n't go into this thing by halves . It is n't fair to her . I 'm going to marry her — yes , I mean it . I owe her that if it will make her happy . But to ask her without really meaning it — knowing she — no , I can n't do that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>with a sad smile</stage>I 'm glad you feel that way . It should n't be hard now for you to convince her . But I know Eileen . She will never consent — for your sake — until she is well again . And stop and think , Mr. Murray . Even if she did consent to marry you right now the shock — the excitement — it would be suicide for her . I would have to warn her against it myself ; and you would n't propose it if you knew the danger to her in her present condition . She has n't long to live , at best . I 've talked with Dr. Stanton . I know . God knows I would be the first one to hold out hope if there was any . There is n't . It 's merely a case of prolonging the short time left to her and making it happy . You must bear that in mind — as a fact !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>dully</stage>All right . I 'll remember . But it 's hell to realise ——<stage>He turns suddenly towards the porch door .</stage>I 'll go out to her now while I feel — that — yes , I know I can make her believe me now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
     <p>You 'll tell me — later on ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p>Yes .<stage>He opens the door to the porch and goes out . Miss Gilpin stands for a moment looking after him worriedly . Then she sighs helplessly and goes out to the hall . Murray steps noiselessly out on the porch . Eileen is lying motionless with her eyes closed . Murray stands looking at her , his face showing the emotional stress he is under , a great pitying tenderness in his eyes . Then he seems to come to a revealing decision on what is best to do for he tiptoes to the bedside and bending down with a quick movement , takes her in his arms and kisses her .</stage>Eileen !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>startled at first , resists automatically for a moment</stage>Stephen !<stage>Then she succumbs and lies back in his arms with a happy sigh , putting both hands to the sides of his face and staring up at him adoringly .</stage>Stephen , dear !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>quickly questioning her before she can question him</stage>You were fibbing — about that night — were n't you ? You do love me , do n't you , Eileen ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>breathlessly</stage>Yes — I — but you , Stephen — you do n't love me .<stage>She makes a movement as if to escape from his embrace .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>genuinely moved — with tender reassurance</stage>Why do you suppose I came up here if not to tell you I did ? But they warned me — Miss Gilpin — that you were still weak and that I must n't excite you in any way . And I — I did n't want — but I had to come back and tell you in spite of them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>convinced — with a happy laugh</stage>And is that why you acted so strange — and cold ? Are n't they silly to tell you that ! As if being happy could hurt me ! Why , it 's just that , just you I 've needed !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>his voice trembling</stage>And you 'll marry me , Eileen ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>a shadow of doubt crossing her face momentarily</stage>Are you sure — you want me , Stephen ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>a lump in his throat — huskily</stage>Yes . I do want you , Eileen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>happily</stage>Then I will — after I 'm well again , of course .<stage>She kisses him .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>chokingly</stage>That wo n't be long now , Eileen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>joyously</stage>No — not long — now that I 'm happy for once in my life . I 'll surprise you , Stephen , the way I 'll pick up and grow fat and healthy . You wo n't know me in a month . How can you ever love such a skinny homely thing as I am now !<stage>With a laugh .</stage>I could n't if I was a man — love such a fright .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p>Sssh !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>confidently</stage>But you 'll see now . I 'll make myself get well . We wo n't have to wait long , dear . And can n't you move up to the town near here where you can see me every day , and you can work and I can help you with your stories just as I used to — and I 'll soon be strong enough to do your typing again .<stage>She laughs .</stage>Listen to me — talking about helping you — as if they were n't all your own work , those blessed stories !— as if I had anything to do with it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>hoarsely</stage>You had ! You did ! They 're yours .<stage>Trying to calm himself .</stage>But you must n't stay here , Eileen . You 'll let me take you away , wo n't you ?— to a better place — not far away — White Lake , it 's called . There 's a small private sanatorium there . Doctor Stanton says it 's one of the best . And I 'll live near by — it 's a beautiful spot — and see you every day .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>in the seventh heaven</stage>And did you plan out all this for me beforehand , Stephen ?<stage>He nods with averted eyes . She kisses his hair .</stage>You wonderful , kind dear ! And it 's a small place — this White Lake ? Then we wo n't have so many people around to disturb us , will we ? We 'll be all to ourselves . And you ought to work so well up there . I know New York was n't good for you — alone — without me . And I 'll get well and strong so quick ! And you say it 's a beautiful place ?<stage>Intensely .</stage>Oh , Stephen , any place in the world would be beautiful to me — if you were with me !<stage>His face is hidden in the pillow beside her . She is suddenly startled by a muffled sob — anxiously .</stage>Why — Stephen — you 're — you 're crying !<stage>The tears start to her own eyes .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>raising his face which is this time alight with a passionate awakening — a revelation</stage>Oh , I do love you , Eileen . I do ! I love you , love you !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>thrilled by the depth of his present sincerity — but with a teasing laugh</stage>Why , you say that as if you 'd just made the discovery , Stephen !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , what does it matter , Eileen ! I love you ! Oh , what a blind , selfish ass I 've been ! I love you ! You are my life — everything ! I love you , Eileen ! I do ! I do ! And we 'll be married ——</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Suddenly his face grows frozen with horror as he remembers the doom . For the first time the grey spectre of Death confronts him face to face as a menacing reality .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>terrified by the look in his eyes</stage>What is it , Stephen ? What ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>with a groan — protesting half-aloud in a strangled voice</stage>No ! No ! It can n't be ——! My God !<stage>He clutches her hands and hides his face in them .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>with a cry</stage>Stephen ! What is the matter ?<stage>Her face suddenly betrays apprehension , an intuitive sense of the truth .</stage>Oh — Stephen ——<stage>Then with a childish whimper of terror .</stage>Oh , Stephen , I 'm going to die ! I 'm going to die !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>lifting his tortured face — wildly</stage>No !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>her voice sinking to a dead , whisper</stage>I 'm going to die .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>seizing her in his arms in a passionate frenzy and pressing his lips to hers</stage>No , Eileen , no , my love , no ! What are you saying ? What could have made you think it ? You — die ? Why , of course , we 're all going to die — but — Good God ! What damned nonsense ! You 're getting well — every day . Everyone — Miss Gilpin — Stanton — everyone told me that . I swear before God , Eileen , they did ! You 're still weak , that 's all . They said — it wo n't be long . You must n't think that — not now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>miserably — unconvinced</stage>But why did you look at me — that way — with that awful look in your eyes ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>While she is speaking Miss Gilpin enters the room from the corridor . She appears worried , agitated . She hurries towards the porch , but stops inside the doorway , arrested by Murray 's voice .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>takes Eileen by the shoulders and forces her to look into his eyes</stage>I was n't thinking about you then —— No , Eileen — not you . I did n't mean you — but me — yes , me ! I could n't tell you before . They 'd warned me — not to excite you — and I knew that would — if you loved me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>staring at him with frightened amazement</stage>You mean you — you 're sick again ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>desperately striving to convince her</stage>Yes . I saw Stanton . I lied to you before — about that . It 's come back on me , Eileen — you see how I look — I 've let myself go . I do n't know how to live without you , do n't you see ? And you 'll — marry me now — without waiting — and help me to get well — you and I together — and not mind their lies — what they say to prevent you ? You 'll do that , Eileen ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p>I 'll do anything for you —— And I 'd be so happy ——<stage>She breaks down .</stage>But , Stephen , I 'm so afraid . I 'm all mixed up . Oh , Stephen , I do n't know what to believe !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>who has been listening thunderstruck to Murray 's wild pleading , at last summons up the determination to interfere — steps out on the porch — a tone of severe remonstrance</stage>Mr. Murray !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>starts to his feet with wild , bewildered eyes — confusedly</stage>Oh — you ——<stage>Miss Gilpin cannot restrain an exclamation of dismay as she sees his face wrung by despair . Eileen turns her head away with a little cry , as if she would hide her face in the bedclothes . A sudden fierce resolution lights up Murray 's countenance — hoarsely .</stage>You 're just in the nick of time , Miss Gilpin ! Eileen ! Listen ! You 'll believe Miss Gilpin , wo n't you ? She knows all about it .<stage>Eileen turns her eyes questioningly on the bewildered nurse .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
     <p>What ——?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>determinedly</stage>Miss Gilpin , Doctor Stanton has spoken to you since he examined me . He must have told you the truth about me . Eileen does n't believe me — when I tell her I 've got T. B . again . She thinks — I do n't know what . I know you 're not supposed to , but can n't you make an exception — in this case ? Ca n't you tell Eileen the truth ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>stunned by being thus defiantly confronted — stammeringly</stage>Mr. Murray ! I — I — how can you ask ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>quickly</stage>Eileen has a right to know . She loves me — and I — I — love her !<stage>He holds her eyes and speaks with a passion of sincerity that compels belief .</stage>I love her , do you hear ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>falteringly</stage>You — love — Eileen ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p>Yes ! I do !<stage>Entreatingly .</stage>So — tell her — wo n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>swallowing hard , her eyes full of pity and sorrow fixed on Eileen</stage>Yes — Eileen — it 's true .<stage>She turns away slowly towards the door .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EILEEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>with a little cry of alarmed concern , stretches out her hands to Murray protectingly</stage>Poor Stephen — dear !<stage>He grasps her hands and kisses them .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>in a low voice</stage>Mr. Murray . May I speak to you for a moment ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>with a look of questioning defiance at her</stage>Certainly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>turns to Eileen with a forced smile</stage>I wo n't steal him away for more than a moment , Eileen .<stage>Eileen smiles happily .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>follows Miss Gilpin into the room . She leads him to the far end of the room near the door to the hall , after shutting the porch door carefully behind him . He looks at her defiantly</stage>Well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MISS GILPIN</speaker>
     <p><stage>in low agitated tones</stage>What has happened ? What is the meaning — I feel as if I may have done a great wrong to myself — to you — to her — by that lie . And yet — something impelled me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURRAY</speaker>
     <p><stage>moved</stage>Do n't regret it , Miss Gilpin ! It has saved her — us . Oh , how can I explain what happened ? I suddenly saw — how beautiful and sweet and good she is — how I could n't bear the thought of life without her — her love —— That 's all .<stage>Determinedly .</stage>She must marry me at once and I will take her away — the far West — any place Stanton thinks can help . And she can take care of me — as she thinks — and I know she will grow well as I seem to grow well . Oh Miss Gilpin , do n't you see ? No half and half measures — no promises — no conditional engagements — can help us — help her . We love too much !<stage>Fiercely , as if defying her .</stage>But we 'll win together . We can !
