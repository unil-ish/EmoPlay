    <head>PROLOGUE</head>
    <stage>The customary three knocks are heard . The drop-curtain wavers and is rising , when a voice rings out , “ Not yet ! ” and the MANAGER , a gentleman of important mien in evening dress , springing from his proscenium box , hurries toward the stage , repeating , “ Not yet ! ”</stage>
    <stage>The curtain is again lowered . The MANAGER turns toward the audience , and resting one hand on the prompter 's box , addresses them :</stage>
    <stage>The curtain is a wall ,— a flying wall . Assured that presently the wall will fly — why haste ? Is it not charming to delay — and just look at it for a while ?</stage>
    <stage>Charming to sit before a great red wall , hanging beneath two gilt masks and a scroll — The thrilling moment is when the curtain thrills , and sounds come from the other side .</stage>
    <stage>You are desired to-night to listen to those sounds and entering the scene before you see it , to wonder and surmise —</stage>
    <stage>Bending his ear , the MANAGER listens to the sounds now beginning to come from behind the curtain .</stage>
    <stage>A footstep — is it a road ? A flutter of wings — is it a garden ?</stage>
    <stage>The curtain here rippling as if about to rise , the MANAGER precipitately shouts , “ Stop !— Do not raise it yet ! ” Then again bending his ear , continues making note of the noises , clear or confused , single or combined , that from this onward come without stop from behind the curtain .</stage>
    <stage>A magpie cawing flies away . Great wooden shoes come running over flags . A courtyard , is it ?— If so above a valley — from whence that softened clamour of birds and barking dogs .</stage>
    <stage>More and more clearly the scene suggests itself — Magically sound creates an atmosphere !— A sheep bell tinkles intermittently — Since there is grazing , we may look for grass .</stage>
    <stage>A tree , too — a tree must rustle in the breeze , for a bullfinch warbles his little native song ; and a blackbird whistling the song he has caught by ear , implies , we may presume , a wicker cage .</stage>
    <stage>The rattling of a wagon run out of a shed — the dripping of a bucket drawn up overfull — the patter of doves ’ feet alighting on a roof — Surely it is a farmyard — unless it be a mill !</stage>
    <stage>Rustling of straw , click of a wooden latch — A stable or a haymow there must be . The locust shrills : the weather then is fine .— Church-bells ring : it is Sunday then .— Chatter of jays : the woods cannot be far !</stage>
    <stage>Hark ! Nature with the scattered voices of a fair midsummer day is composing — in a dream !— the most mysterious of overtures — harmonised by evening distance and the wind !</stage>
    <stage>And all these sounds — song of a passing girl — laughter of children jogged by the donkey trotting — faraway gun-reports and hunting-horns — these sounds describe a holiday .</stage>
    <stage>A window opens , a door closes — The harness shakes its bells . Is it not plain in sight , the old farmyard ?— The dog sleeps , the cat but feigns to sleep .</stage>
    <stage>Sunday !— Farmer and farmer 's wife are starting for the fair . The old horse paws the ground —</stage>
    <stage>A ROUGH VOICE [ Behind the curtain , through the horse 's pawing . ] Whoa , Dapple !</stage>
    <stage>ANOTHER VOICE [ As if calling to a laggard . ] Come along ! We sha n't get home till morning !</stage>
    <stage>AN IMPATIENT VOICE Are you ready ?</stage>
    <stage>ANOTHER VOICE Fasten the shutters !</stage>
    <stage>MAN 'S VOICE All right !</stage>
    <stage>WOMAN 'S VOICE My sunshade !</stage>
    <stage>MAN 'S VOICE [ Through the cracking of the whip . ] Gee up !</stage>
    <stage>THE MANAGER The wagon to the jingling of the harness rattles off , jolting out ditties . A turn in the road cuts off the unfinished song .— They are gone , quite gone . The performance can begin .</stage>
    <stage>Some philosophers would say there was not a soul left , but we humbly believe that there are hearts . Man in leaving does not take with him all drama . One can laugh and suffer without him . [ He listens again . ]</stage>
    <stage>Ardently humming , a velvety bumblebee hovers — then is still ; he has plunged into a flower — Let us begin . Pray note that Aesop 's hump to-night does duty as prompter 's box !</stage>
    <stage>The members of our company are small , but — [ Calling toward the flies . ] Alexander ! [ To the audience . ] He is my chief machinist . [ Calling again . ] Let it down !</stage>
    <stage>A VOICE [ From the flies . ] It 's coming , sir !</stage>
    <stage>MANAGER We have lowered between the audience and the stage an invisible screen of magnifying glass —</stage>
    <stage>But there the violins are tuning up : Scraping of crystal bows , picking of strings !— Hush ! Let the footlights now leap into brightness , for at a signal from their little leader the crickets ’ orchestra have briskly fallen to !</stage>
    <stage>Frrrt ! The bumblebee emerges from the flower , shaking the yellow dust — A Hen comes on the scene as in La Fontaine 's fable . A Cuckoo calls , as in Beethoven 's symphony .</stage>
    <stage>Hush ! Let the chandelier draw in its myriad lights — for the curious call-boy of the woods has , airily , to summon us , repeated thrice his double call —</stage>
    <stage>And since Nature is one of our performers , and feathered notables are on our staff — Hush ! the curtain must go up : A wood-pecker 's bill has rapped out the three strokes !</stage>

    <head type="act">ACT I</head>
    <head>THE EVENING OF THE PHEASANT-HEN</head>
    <stage>A farmyard such as the sounds from behind the curtain have described . At the right , a house over-clambered with wistaria . At the left , the farmyard gate , letting on to the road . A dog-kennel . At the back , a low wall , beyond which distant country landscape . The details of the setting define themselves in the course of the act .</stage>
    <div type="scene" n="1">
     <head type="scene">SCENE FIRST</head>
     <stage type="setting">
      <stage>The whole barnyard company , HENS , CHICKENS , CHICKS , DUCKS , TURKEYS , etc . ; THE BLACKBIRD in his cage , THE CAT asleep on the wall , later A BUTTERFLY on the flowers .</stage>
     </stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE WHITE HEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>Pecking .</stage>Ah ! Delicious !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANOTHER HEN</speaker>
      <p>What are you eating ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ALL THE HENS</speaker>
      <p><stage>Rushing to the spot .</stage>What 's she eating ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE WHITE HEN</speaker>
      <p>A small green beetle , crisp and nice , tasting of the rose-leaves he had lived on .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE BLACK HEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>Standing before the BLACKBIRD 'S cage .</stage>Really , the Blackbird whistles amazingly !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE WHITE HEN</speaker>
      <p>Any little street urchin can do as much !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE TURKEY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Solemnly .</stage>An urchin who had learned of a shepherd in Sicily !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE DUCK</speaker>
      <p>He never whistles his tune to the end —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE TURKEY</speaker>
      <p>That 's too easy , carrying it to the end !<stage>He hums the tune the BLACKBIRD has been whistling .</stage>“ How sweet to fare afield , and cull — and cull — ” You should know , Duck , that the thing in art is to leave off before the end ! “ And cull — and cull — ” Bravo , Blackbird !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>The BLACKBIRD comes out on the little platform in front of his cage and bows .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>A CHICK</speaker>
      <p><stage>Astonished .</stage>Can he get out ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BLACKBIRD</speaker>
      <p>Applause is salt on my tail !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE CHICK</speaker>
      <p>But his cage ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE TURKEY</speaker>
      <p>He can come out , and he can go in again . His cage has that sort of spring .— “ And cull — and cull — ” The whole point is missed if you tell them what you cull !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE BLACK HEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>Catching sight of a BUTTERFLY alighting on the flowers above the wall at the back .</stage>Oh , what a gorgeous butterfly !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE WHITE HEN</speaker>
      <p>Where ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE BLACK HEN</speaker>
      <p>On the honey-suckle .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE TURKEY</speaker>
      <p>That kind is called an Admiral .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE CHICK</speaker>
      <p><stage>Looking after the BUTTERFLY .</stage>Now he has settled on a pink .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE WHITE HEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>To the TURKEY .</stage>An Admiral , wherefore ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE BLACKBIRD</speaker>
      <p>Obviously because he is neither a seaman nor a soldier .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE WHITE HEN</speaker>
      <p>Our Blackbird has a pretty wit !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE TURKEY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Nodding and swinging his red stalactite .</stage>He has better than wit , my dear !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ANOTHER HEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>Watching the BUTTERFLY .</stage>It 's sweet — a butterfly !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE BLACKBIRD</speaker>
      <p>Easy as possible to make ! You take a W and set it on top of a Y !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>A HEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>Delighted .</stage>A flourish of his bill , and there you have your caricature !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE TURKEY</speaker>
      <p>He does better than execute caricatures ! Hen , our Blackbird forces you to think while obliging you to laugh . He is a Teacher in wit 's clothing .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>A CHICK</speaker>
      <p><stage>To a HEN .</stage>Mother , why does the Cat hate the Dog ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE BLACKBIRD</speaker>
      <p>Because he appropriates his seat at the theatre .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE CHICK</speaker>
      <p><stage>Surprised .</stage>They have a theatre ?</p>

      <speaker>THE BLACKBIRD</speaker>

      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE TURKEY</speaker>
      <p><stage>Delighted .</stage>How aptly he conveys that the hatred of peoples is at bottom a question of wanting the other 's territory . There 's a brain for you !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE SPECKLED HEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>To the WHITE HEN , who is pecking .</stage>Do you peck peppers ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE WHITE HEN</speaker>
      <p>Constantly .</p>

      <speaker>THE SPECKLED HEN</speaker>
      <p>How can you stand the sting ?</p>

      <speaker>THE WHITE HEN</speaker>
      <p>It imparts to the feathers a delicate rosy tint .</p>

      <lg>
       <l>Oh , does it !</l>

     <sp>
      <speaker>THE WHITE HEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>Going near enough to her to speak in an undertone .</stage>Do you mean to say you love him ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE GREY HEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>Sadly .</stage>Without ever having set eyes on him . He lives in a chalet hanging on the kitchen wall , above the farmer 's great-coat and fowling-piece . The moment he sings , I rush to the spot , but I never get there in time to see anything but his little wicket closing . This evening I mean to stay right here beside the door —<stage>She takes up her position on the threshold .</stage></p>

No , I tell you , no ! She did much more than the big whip 's noisy cracking , did the little Fly , with the music straight from her buzzing heart !</p>

Should you spy , as he strolls across some flowery umbel , a scarlet beetle peppered with black dots ,— the stroller take , but spare his strolling-ground .

      <p>More out of tune all by itself than a whole village singing society !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>Come , what have they done to you , that whistler and that posturer ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p><stage>Grumbling .</stage>They have done to me — that I know not what they may do to you ! They have done to me — that among us simple , kindly folk they have introduced new fashions , the Blackbird of being funny , the Peacock of putting on airs ! Fashions which the latter in his grotesque bad taste picked up parading on the marble terraces of the vulgar rich , and the former — Heaven knows where ! along with his cynicism and his slang . Now the one , travelling salesman of blighting corrosive laughter , and the other , brainless ambassador of Fashion , their mission to kill among us love and labour , the first by persiflage , the second by display ,— they have brought to us , even here in our peaceful sunny corner , the two pests , the saddest in the world , the jest which insists on being funny at any cost , and the cry which insists on being the latest scream !<stage>The BLACKBIRD is heard tentatively whistling , “ How sweet to fare afield ” .</stage>You , Cock , who had the sense to prefer the grain of true wheat to the pearl , how can you allow yourself to be taken in by that villainous Blackbird ! A bird who practises a tune !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Indulgently .</stage>Come , he whistles his tune like many another !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p><stage>Unwillingly agreeing , in a drawling growl .</stage>Ye-e-es , but he never whistles it to the end !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Watching the BLACKBIRD hopping about .</stage>A light-hearted fellow !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p><stage>Same business .</stage>Ye-e-es , but he lies heavy on our hearts . A bird who takes his exercise indoors !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>You must own he is intelligent !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p><stage>In a longer , more hesitant growl .</stage>Ye-e-e-es ! But not so very ! For his eye never brightens with wonder and admiration . He preserves before the flower — of whose stalk he sees more than of its chalice — the glance which deflowers , the tone which depreciates !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>Taste , my dear fellow , he unmistakably has !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p>Ye-e-e-es ! But not much taste ! To wear black is too easy a way of having taste ! One should have the courage of colours on his wing .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>You will admit at least that he has an original fancy . No denying that he is amusing .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p>Ye-e-es — No ! Why is it amusing to adopt a few stock phrases and make them do service at every turn ? Why amusing to miscall , exaggerate , and vulgarise ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>His mind has a diverting , unexpected turn —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p>Ready but cheap ! I cannot think it particularly brilliant to remark , with a knowing wink , at sight of an innocent cow at pasture , “ The simple cow knows her way to the hay ! ” Nor do I regard it as evidence of notable mental gifts to answer the greeting of the inoffensive duck , “ The quack shoots off his mouth ! ” No , the extravagances of that Blackbird , who makes me bristle , no more constitute wit than his slang achieves style !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>He is not altogether to blame . He wears the modern garb . See him there in correct evening dress . He looks , in his neat black coat —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p>Like a beastly little undertaker who , after burying Faith , hops with relief and glee !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>There , there ! You make him blacker than he is !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p>I do believe a blackbird is just a misfit crow !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>His diminutive size , however —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p><stage>Vigorously shaking his ears .</stage>Oh , be not deceived by his size ! Evil makes his models first on a tiny scale . The soul of a cutlass dwells in the pocket-knife ; blackbird and crow are of the selfsame crape , and the striped wasp is a tiger in miniature !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Amused at PATOU 'S violence .</stage>The blackbird in short is wicked , stupid , ugly —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p>The chief thing about the Blackbird is — that you can n't tell what he is ! Is there thought in that head ? feeling in that breast ? Hear him ! “ Tew-tew-tew-tew tew — ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>But what harm does he do ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p>He tew-tew-tews ! And nothing is so mortal to thought and sentiment as that same derisive tew-tewing , disingenuous and non-committal ! Day by day , and that is why I roll my rs , I must witness this debasing of language and ideals . It 's enough to produce rabies !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>Come , Patou !—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p>In their objectionable jargon , they have the ha-ha on all of us ! I am no fastidious King Charles , but I dislike , I tell you , being referred to as His Whiskers !— Oh , to be gone , escape , follow the heels of some poor shepherd without a crust in his wallet , but at least , at evening drinking from the glassy pond , to have — oh , better than all marrow-bones !— the fresh illusion of lapping up the stars !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Surprised at PATOU 'S having lowered his voice to utter the last words .</stage>Why do you drop your voice ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p>You see ?— If we speak of stars nowadays we must do it in a whisper !<stage>He lays his head on his paws in deep dejection .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Comforting him .</stage>Be not downcast !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p><stage>Lifting his head again .</stage>No , it is too silly and too weak ! I 'll shout it if I please !<stage>He howls with the whole power of his lungs .</stage>Stars !—<stage>Then in a tone of relief .</stage>There , I feel better !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHICKENS</speaker>
      <p><stage>Passing at the back , mocking .</stage>Stars !— Ho ! Stars for ours ! Stars !<stage>They go off , fooling and giggling .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p>Hear them ! Our pullets will be whistling soon like blackbirds !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Proudly strutting up and down .</stage>What care I ? I sing , and have on my side the Hens .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p>Trust not to the hearts of Hens — or of crowds . You are too willing to take the price of your singing in lip-service .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>But love — love is glory awarded in kisses !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p>Ah ! I , too , was young once , I had my wilding devil 's beauty ,— an inflammatory eye , an inflammable heart . Well , I was deceived . For a handsomer dog ?— No , they deceived me for a miserable cur !—<stage>Roaring in sudden wrath .</stage>For whom ?— For whom , do you suppose ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Retreating .</stage>You alarm me !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p>For a low-down dachshund who trod on his own ears !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE BLACKBIRD</speaker>
      <p><stage>Who has overheard PATOU 'S last words , sticking his head between the bars of his cage .</stage>Still harping on the dachshund , is he ? What 's the odds , old chappie ? You were the goat !— How does being the goat matter ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p>But you up there , scoffing at everything , who are you , may one ask ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BLACKBIRD</speaker>
      <p>I 'm the pet of the poultry yard !</p>

      <p>Bad luck is what you 'll bring them !</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>BLACKBIRD</speaker>
      <p>A prophecy-sharp ?— Say , wisteria , we are twisted up with laughter !<stage>He comes out of his cage and hops to the ground .</stage></p>

      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p><stage>As he approaches</stage>Grrrrrrr —</p>

      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>Hush ! He 's a friend !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p>A false one .</p>

      <p><stage>To BLACKBIRD .</stage>Fine things we learn when the talk is of you !</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>THE OLD HEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>Her head protruding from the basket .</stage>Strike rotten wood , and see the wood-lice scatter !<stage>The basket-lid drops .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p><stage>To CHANTECLER .</stage>He laughs at you behind your back !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BLACKBIRD</speaker>
      <p><stage>To PATOU .</stage>Ha , retriever , you retrieve ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p>When you pour forth your heart in your ardent cry , giving it over and over , he calls it the same old saw that your jag-toothed red crest stands for !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>So that 's what you say ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BLACKBIRD</speaker>
      <p><stage>Affecting simplicity .</stage>You surely do n't mind ? How can it affect you ? And a joke about you is always so sure of success !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p><stage>To the BLACKBIRD .</stage>Point-blank , do you admire or despise the Cock ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BLACKBIRD</speaker>
      <p>I make fun of him in spots , but admire him in lump !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p>You always peck two kinds of seed .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE BLACKBIRD</speaker>
      <p>My cage has two seed-cups , you see .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p>I am single-minded and downright !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE BLACKBIRD</speaker>
      <p>You — are an old poodle of the year 48 ! I am an up-to-date bird !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p><stage>Gruffly .</stage>Out of my way ! lest I give your black coat red tails !<stage>The BLACKBIRD nimbly gets out of the way , PATOU goes into his kennel grumbling .</stage>I 'll show him some up-to-date jaws !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>Be quiet ! It 's his way . The truth is that if once he stood in the presence of beauty , this very Blackbird would applaud !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p>Not with both wings ! What can you expect of a bird who , with woodbine and juniper full in sight , prefers to go inside and peck at a musty biscuit ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>BLACKBIRD</speaker>
      <p>He never seems to suspect that the poacher is a blackguardly sort of brute !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p>What I know is that the underbrush is all a delicate golden gloom —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE BLACKBIRD</speaker>
      <p>Yes , but leaden shot can cleave your delicate gold . The quail is such a canny bird , that he lies low lest he make his last appearance on toast . And so , in lack of quail —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p>Does the great stag delight any the less in his green forest for turning over among the grass at evening some bit of a rusty cartridge ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE BLACKBIRD</speaker>
      <p>No , old chap — but the stag , you see , is just another kind of a hat-rack !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p>Oh , but freedom , freedom , with violets looking on ! Love !—</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE BLACKBIRD</speaker>
      <p>Antediluvian pastimes ! not nearly such good fun as my nice new wooden trapeze . Oh , my cage , let us sign a joyful three-six-nine years ’ lease ! I live like a Duke , I have filtered drinking-water —<stage>At PATOU 'S significant start and growl , he springs aside , finishing .</stage>You can sling mud upon me , I have a porcelain bath !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Slightly out of patience .</stage>Why not make a practice of talking simply and to the point ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE BLACKBIRD</speaker>
      <p>I like to make you sit up , and watch you blinking .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p>Grrrrr — in the plain interest of public decency , I say it behooves us —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE BLACKBIRD</speaker>
      <p>Do n't say behooves , say it 's up to you , old chap !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>What 's all this juggling with words ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE BLACKBIRD</speaker>
      <p>The thing , Chantecler , quite the thing ! I knew a city sparrow once , and it 's the way they talk in fashionable circles .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>I was well acquainted with a little red-breast , who lived beneath a city poet 's eaves ; he did not talk like you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE BLACKBIRD</speaker>
      <p>I belong to my time . Every chap that 's a bit of a swell nowadays must be a bit of a tough . It 's smart , you know .</p>

      <speaker>THE BLACKBIRD</speaker>
      <p>You see , she must take advantage of the time when the garden is deserted , and yet have it a five-o'clock tea . So she chose the hour when the old gardener is at his early potations .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE BLACKBIRD</speaker>
      <p>Is that streaming eye , my friend , a result of age or rheumatism ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>PATOU</speaker>
      <p>Neither ! But I have within me several dogs , and there is conflict amidst me . My hunter 's nostril twitches at a shot , but , directly , my house-dog 's memory raises before me a bleeding wing , the glazing eye of a doe , the pathos of a rabbit 's dying look — and I feel the heart of a Saint Bernard waking in my breast !<stage>Another shot .</stage></p>

      <speaker>BRIFFAUT</speaker>
      <p>She leaves off laying and hatching eggs . Nature then gives her back her purple and her gold , and the pheasant-hen proud and magnificent Amazon , preferring to put on her back blue , green , yellow , all the colours of the prism , rather than under a sober grey wing to shelter a brood of young pheasants , flies freely forth — Light-mindedly she sheds the virtues of her sex , and having done it — sees life !<stage>He sketches with his paw a slightly disrespectful gesture .</stage></p>

      <speaker>THE PHEASANT-HEN</speaker>
      <p>Beneath foliage — not so thick but a sunbeam may glide in !— I make my home . I am descended , however , from elsewhere . From whence ? From Persia ? China ? None can tell ! But of one thing we may be certain : that I was meant to shimmer in the blue among the fragrant gum-trees of the East , and not to be chased through brambles by a hound !— Am I the ancient Phoenix ? or the sacred Chinese hen ? Whence was I brought to this land ? And how brought ? And by whom ? History is not explicit on the point , and leaves us a splendid choice . Wherefore I choose to have been born in Colchis , from whence I came on Jason 's fist . I am all gold . Perhaps I was the Fleece !</p>

      <speaker>THE PHEASANT-HEN</speaker>
      <p>I refer to my race , for which I stand , by token of my crimson shield . Yes , my ancient fate of being a dead leaf beside a ruby , having appeared to me one day too distinctly dull a lot , I stole his dazzling plumage from the male . A good thing , too , for it becomes me so much better ! The golden tippet , as I wear it , curves and shimmers . The emerald epaulette acquires a dainty grace . I have made of a mere uniform a miracle of style !</p>

      <p>Oh , I understand , of course . We are the illustrious Cock ! Not a Hen in the world but preens her feathers in the hope — the very touching hope , certainly — of offering us a moment 's distraction , some day , between two songs . We are so sure of ourself that we never hesitate , not even when the lady is a visitor , and not quite the ordinary short-kirtled Hen whom one can engage without further ceremony by such advances —</p>

      <p>Light , the universal goddess ! That geranium planted by the farmer 's wife is never twice the same red ! And that old wooden shoe , spurting straw , what a sight , what a beautiful sight ! And the wooden comb hanging among the farmer 's smocks , with the green hair of the sward caught in its teeth ! The pitchfork , stood in the corner , like a misbehaving child , dozing as he stands and dreaming of the hay-fields ! And the bowl and skittles there ,— the trim-waisted skittles , shapely maids , whose orderly quadrilles Patou in his gambols clumsily upsets ! The great worm-eaten bowl whose curved expanse some ant is always crossing , travelling with no less pride than famed explorers ,— around her ball in 80 seconds !— Nothing , I tell you , is two instants quite the same !— And I , sweet lady , have been so susceptible ever , that a garden-rake in a corner , a flower in a pot , cast me long since into a helpless ecstasy , and that from gazing at a morning-glory I fell into the startled admiration which has made my eye so round !</p>

      <p>Through the Peacock , likewise working in our cause , the Cock came out of fashion . But his song is just as inconvenient , in fashion or out of it . He is all the more proudly uncompromising for no longer being in style .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>Yes , I feel that I shall tell , and I know I shall do ill in telling . And it 's all because of the gold on her dainty little head !<stage>Going brusquely nearer to her .</stage>Shall you prove worthy , at least , of having been chosen ? Is your breast true red to the core ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PHEASANT-HEN</speaker>
      <p>Now tell me !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>Look at me , Pheasant-hen , and try , if indeed it be possible , try to recognise , by yourself , sign by sign , the vocation of which my body is the symbol . Guess , to begin with , at my destiny from my shape , and see how , curved like a sort of living hunting-horn , I am as much formed for sound to turn and gain volume within me , as the wild duck is formed to swim !— Wait !— Mark the fact that , impatient and proud , scratching up the earth with my claws , I appear always to be seeking something in the soil —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PHEASANT-HEN</speaker>
      <p>You are seeking for grains of corn , seeds , I suppose .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>Never ! I have never looked for such things . I find them occasionally , into the bargain , but disdainfully I give them to my Hens .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PHEASANT-HEN</speaker>
      <p>Well , then , in your perpetual scratching , what is it you are looking for ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>The right spot ! For always before singing I carefully choose my stand . Pray , observe —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PHEASANT-HEN</speaker>
      <p>True , and then you ruffle your feathers .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>I never start to sing until my eight claws , after clearing a space of weeds and stones , have found the soft , dark turf underneath . Then , placed in direct contact with the good earth , I sing !— And that is already half the mystery , Pheasant-hen , half the mystery of my song , which is not of those songs one sings after composing them , but is received straight from the native soil , like sap ! And the time above all when that sap arises in me ,— the hour , briefly , in which I have genius , in which I can never doubt I have !— is the hour when dawn falters on the boundaries of the dark sky . Then , filled with the same quivering as leaves and grass , thrilled to the very tips of my wing quills , I feel myself a chosen instrument . I accentuate my curve of a hunting-horn , Earth speaks in me as in a conch , and ceasing to be an ordinary bird , I become the mouthpiece , in some sort official , through which the cry of the earth escapes toward the sky !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PHEASANT-HEN</speaker>
      <p>Chantecler !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>And that cry which rises from the earth , that cry is such a cry of love for the light , is such a deep and frenzied cry of love for the golden thing we call the Day , and that all thirst to feel again : the pine on its bark , the tortuous roots in woodland paths on their mosses , the feather-grass on each delicate spray , the tiniest pebble in its tiniest mica flake ; it is so wonderfully the cry of all that misses and mourns its colour , its reflection , its flame , its coronet , its pearl ; the beseeching cry of the dew-washed meadow begging for a wee rainbow at every grass-tip , of the forest begging a burst of fire at the end of each gloomy avenue ; that cry which mounts to the sky through me is so greatly the cry of all that feels itself in disgrace , plunged in a sunless pit , deprived of light without knowing for what offence ; is the cry of cold , the cry of fear , the cry of weariness , of all that night disables or disarms ; the rose shivering alone in the dark , the hay wanting to be dried and go to the mow , the sickle forgotten out of doors by the reaper and fearing it will rust in the grass , the white things dismayed at not looking white ; is so greatly the cry of the innocent among beasts , who have nothing to conceal , of the brook fain to show its crystal clearness ; and even — for thy very works , O Night , disown thee !— of the puddle longing to glisten , the mud longing to become earth again , by drying ; it is so greatly the magnificent cry of the field impatient to feel its wheat and barley growing , of the blossoming tree mad for still more blossoms of the green grapes craving a purple side ; of the bridge waiting for footsteps , for shadows of birds among shadows of branches ; the voice of all that yearns to sing , to drop the garb of mourning , live again , serve again , be a brink , be a bourn , a sun-warm seat , a stone glad to comfort with warmth the hand touching , or the insect overcrawling it ; finally , it is so greatly the cry toward the light of all Beauty , all Health , all which wishes , in sunshine and joy , to see its work while doing it , and do it to be seen — And when I feel that vast call to the Day arising within me , I so expand my soul to make it more sonorous , by making it more spacious , that the great cry may still be increased in greatness ; before giving it , I withold it in my soul a moment so piously ; then , when , to expel it , I contract my soul , I am so convinced of accomplishing a great act , I have such faith that my song will make night crumble like the walls of Jericho —</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>And sounding its victory beforehand , my song springs forth so clear , so proud , so peremptory , that the horizon , seized with a rosy trembling — obeys !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PHEASANT-HEN</speaker>
      <p>Chantecler !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>I sing ! Vainly Night offers to compromise , offers a dubious twilight — I sing again ! And suddenly —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PHEASANT-HEN</speaker>
      <p>Chantecler !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>I fall back , blinded by the red light bathing me , dazzled at having , I , the Cock , made the Sun to rise !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PHEASANT-HEN</speaker>
      <p>Then the whole secret of your song —?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>Is that I dare assume that the East without me must rest in idleness ! I sing , not to hear the echo repeat , a shade fainter , my song ! I think of light and not of glory ! Singing is my fashion of waging war and bearing witness . And if my song is the proudest of songs , it is that I sing clearly to make the day rise clear !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PHEASANT-HEN</speaker>
      <p>What he says sounds slightly mad !— You are responsible for the rising of —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>That which opens flower , eye , soul , and window ! Certainly ! My voice dispenses light ! And when the sky is grey , the reason is that I have sung badly .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PHEASANT-HEN</speaker>
      <p>But when you sing by day ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>I am practising , or else promising the ploughshare , the hoe , the harrow , the scythe , not to neglect my duty of waking them .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PHEASANT-HEN</speaker>
      <p>But what wakens you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>The fear of forgetting .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PHEASANT-HEN</speaker>
      <p>And you believe that at the sound of your voice the whole world is suffused —?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>I have no clear idea of the whole world . But I sing for my own valley , and desire that every Cock may do the same for his .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PHEASANT-HEN</speaker>
      <p>Still —</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>But here I stand , explaining , perorating , and forgetting altogether to make my dawn .</p>

     <sp>

      <p>His dawn !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>Ah , what I say sounds mad ? I will make the dawn before your very eyes ! And the wish to please you adding its ardour to the ordinary forces of my soul , I shall rise in singing , as I feel , to unusual heights , and the dawn will rise more fair to-day than ever it rose before !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PHEASANT-HEN</speaker>
      <p>More fair ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>Assuredly ,— in just the measure that strength is added to the song by the knowledge of listeners , boldness to the exploit by the consciousness of lovely watching eyes —<stage>Taking his stand upon a hillock at the back , overlooking the valley .</stage>Now , Madam !</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>Alas !— But shall we therefore despond ?<stage>And tearing himself from melancholy , he springs toward the left .</stage>There is still much to do over here .

      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>I sang in total blackness . My song rose from the cheerless shade , and was the first to rise . It is when Night prevails that it 's fine to believe in the Light !</p>

      <p>How dare they sing when you are singing ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>Let them sing ! Their songs acquire significance from mingling with mine , and their tardy but numerous cries unconsciously hasten the flight of the dark .<stage>Straightening upon his hillock , he calls to the distant COCKS .</stage>Now , all together !</p>

      <p>Such a burden of responsibility resting upon me ! That inspiring breath which I await when I scratch in the sand , will it come again ? I feel the whole future depending upon an incomprehensible something which might perchance fail me ! Do you understand now the anguish gnawing me ? Ah , the swan is certain , by bending his neck , to find under water the grasses he delights in ; the eagle , when he swoops from the blue , sure of falling upon his prey ; and you are ever sure of finding in the earth the well supplied nests of the ants ,— but I , for whom my own work remains a mystery , I , possessed ever by the fear of the morrow , am I sure of finding my song in my heart ?</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>THE BLACKBIRD</speaker>
      <p>Hang the pot ! I 've had a sensation ! I tell you I was wild ! My feet were doing such a horn-pipe I had trouble to keep my eye steady at the peep-hole .</p>

      <p>Nay , my best ! Pardon if my best combines merely the green of all April with the gold of all October ! I stand abashed . I am the Cock , just the Cock , without further addition . The Cock such as he is still found in some old-fashioned barnyard .

But your perverse attempts to wring blushes from little baggages in convenient corners outrage my love of Love ! It is true that I care more to retain love 's dream than these Cochin-Chinese , who , courting a giggle , use refinement in coarseness , research in vulgarity ; true that my blood has swifter flow in a less ponderous body , and that I am not a feathered pig ,— but a Cock !</p>

      <p><stage>To the birds nearest to him .</stage>He is vexed because of those Cocks whom I introduced .<stage>To CHANTECLER , ironically .</stage>What , my dear sir , do you say to these resplendent gentlemen ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>I say , my dear sir , that these resplendent gentlemen are manufactured wares , the work of merchants with highly complex brains , who to fashion a ridiculous Chicken have taken a wing from that one , a topknot from this . I say that in such Cocks nothing remains of the true Cock . They are Cocks of shreds and patches , idle bric-a-brac , fit to figure in a catalogue , not in a barnyard with its decent dunghill and its dog . I say that those befrizzled , beruffled , bedeviled Cocks were never stroked and cherished by Nature 's maternal hand . I say that it 's all Aviculture , and Aviculture is flapdoodle ! And I say that those preposterous parrots , without style , without beauty , without form , whose bodies have not even kept the pleasing oval of the egg they were hatched from , look like so many desperate fowls escaped from some hen-coop of the Apocalypse !</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p><stage>With rising spirit .</stage>And I add that the whole duty of a Cock is to be an embodied crimson cry ! And when a Cock is not that , it matters little that his comb be shaped like a toadstool , or his quills twisted like a screw , he will soon vanish and be heard of no more , having been nothing but a variety of a variety !</p>

      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p><stage>Going from one to the other .</stage>Yes , Cocks affecting incongruous forms , Cocks crowned with cocoa-palm coiffures — Hear me talk like the Peacock ! I lapse into alliteration !<stage>Finding his fun in bewildering them with cackling guttural volubility .</stage>Yes , Cockerels cockaded with cockles , Cockatrice-headed Cockasters , cock-eyed Cockatoos ! Not content to be common Cocks , your crotchet it was to be what but crack Cocks ? Yes , Fashion , to be accounted of thy flock , these chuckle-headed Cocks craved to be Super-cocks . But know ye not , ye crazy Cocks , one cannot be so queer a Cock , but there may occur a queerer Cock ? Let some Cock come whose coccyx boasts a more flamboyant shock , and you pass like childish measles , croup or chicken-pox ! Consider that to-morrow , high Cockalorums , fancy Cocks , consider that day after to-morrow , cheese-capped goblet-crested Cocks , in spite of curly hackle and cauliflowered hocks , a more fantastic Cock than ever may creep out of a — box ! For the Cock-fancier , to diversify his stock , may more fantastically still combine his Cutcutdaycuts and his Cocks , and you will be no more — sad Cuckoos made a mock !— but old rococo Cocks beside this more coquettish Cock !</p>

      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>You wish to ape the sparrow of city streets ! But his impudence is not a manner of prudence , an art of remaining vague , an elegant method of having no opinion . His eyes always express either wrath or delight . Do you care to know the secret by which the little beggar , with his “ Chappie ” and his “ See ” can steal away our hearts ? It is that he is frank and fearless that he believes , that he loves , that the railings of a balcony where some child strews crumbs for him are the only cage he ever knew ! It is that one can be sure of his gaiety of soul , since he is gay when he is hungry ! But you who , void of gaiety because void of love , have imagined that evil wit can take the place of good humour , and that one can play the sparrow when he is a sleek and vulgar trimmer , sniggering behind his wing , what I say to you is , “ Guess again , Mock-sparrow , guess again ! ”</p>

The WOODPECKER stands at his bark window , dreamily nodding ; all the RABBITS , with uppricked ears , sit at their earthen doors .</stage>

      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>There must have been left in the air some power from my yesterday 's song .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p><stage>With all his strength come back to him .</stage>The proof that I was serving the cause of light when I sang is that the Owls are glad of my silence .<stage>Going to the PHEASANT-HEN , with defiance in his mien .</stage>I make the Dawn appear , and I do more than that !</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>

      <p>On grey mornings , when poor creatures waking in the twilight dare not believe in the day , the bright copper of my song takes the place of the sun !<stage>Turning to go .</stage>Back to our work !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PHEASANT-HEN</speaker>
      <p>But how find courage to work after doubting the work 's value ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>Buckle down to work !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PHEASANT-HEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>With angry stubbornness .</stage>But if you have nothing whatever to do with making the morning ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>Then I am just the Cock of a remoter Sun ! My cries so affect the night that it lets certain beams of the day pierce through its black tent , and those are what we call the stars . I shall not live to see shining upon the steeples that final total light composed of stars clustered in unbroken mass ; but if I sing faithfully and sonorously and if , long after me , and long after that , in every farmyard its Cock sings faithfully , sonorously , I truly believe there will be no more night !</p>

      <p>No , I shall never forget the noble green forest where I learned that he who has witnessed the death of his dream must either die at once or else arise stronger than before .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE PHEASANT-HEN</speaker>
      <p><stage>In a voice which she does her best to make insulting .</stage>Go and get into your hen-house by the way of a ladder .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>The birds have taught me that I can use my wings to go in .</p>

      <speaker>THE PHEASANT-HEN</speaker>
      <p>Go and see your old Hen in her old broken basket .</p>

      <speaker>CHANTECLER</speaker>
      <p>Ah , forest of the Toads , forest of the Poacher , forest of the Nightingale , and of the Pheasant-hen , when my old peasant mother sees me home again , back from your green recesses where pain is so interwoven with love , what will she say ?</p>
