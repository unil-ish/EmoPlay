    <head>PROLOGUE .</head>
    <stage>The scene represents a wild , deserted place , the slope of a mountain rising to infinite heights . In the rear of the stage , halfway up the mountain , huge iron gates , tightly closed , indicate the boundary of the world as we conceive it . Beyond the iron gates , which oppress the earth with their enormous weight , in silence and in mystery , dwells the Beginning of every being , the Supreme Wisdom of the universe .</stage>
    <stage>At the foot of the Gates stands Someone guarding the entrances , leaning upon a long sword , perfectly motionless . Garbed in wide clothes , which are like stone in the motionlessness of their folds and creases , He hides His face beneath a dark cover , and is Himself the greatest of mysteries . Standing on the boundary separating two worlds , he is dual in his make-up ;— in appearance a man , in reality a spirit . An arbitrator between two worlds , He is like unto a huge shield , which gathers all bolts ,— all looks , all entreaties , all expectations , reproaches , and curses . The bearer of two elements , He wraps his speech in silence , which is like the silence of the iron gates , and sometimes in human words .</stage>
    <stage>Amidst the rocks , looking around on all sides strangely and shyly , appears Anathema , someone accursed . Clinging to the grey rocks , himself grey , cautious and flexible , like a serpent seeking a hole , he goes stealthily and quietly to the Guardian of the Entrances , desiring to strike him with an unexpected blow . But he is frightened by his own audacity and , jumping to his feet , laughs defiantly and maliciously . Then he sits down on a rock , with an air of freedom and independence , and throws small cobblestones at the feet of the Guardian of the Entrances ;— cunning , he conceals his fear beneath the mask of raillery and slight audacity . In the faint , grey , almost colorless light , the head of the accursed one seems enormous ; especially large is his high forehead , which is furrowed by wrinkles of fruitless reflections and unsolvable eternal problems . Anathema 's thin beard is perfectly grey ; his hair , once jet black , is also greyish , rising on his head in disordered tufts . Restless in his movements , he is vainly trying to conceal his alarm and his purposeless haste , which are forever devouring him . Endeavoring to emulate the proud stillness of the Guardian of the Entrances , he grows quiet for an instant in the pose of proud majesty , but the very next moment , in painful quest after the eternally elusive , he wriggles in mute spasms , like a worm under foot . And in his questions he is rapid and impetuous like a whirlwind , drawing strength and fury in his mad whirl ....</stage>
    <p>ANATHEMA .</p>
    <stage>You are still here on guard ? And I thought you were away ,— even a chained dog has his moments of rest or sleep , even though the whole world be his kennel and Eternity his master ! Is Eternity afraid of thieves ? But do not be angry . I have come to you as a good friend and I implore humbly : Open the heavy Gates for an instant and allow me to have a glimpse of Eternity . You dare not ? But perhaps the mighty gates have cracked from age , and the unfortunate , honest Anathema could peep into the narrow cleft , without disturbing any one ,— show me it with a sign . Softly , on my belly , will I crawl over , I will glance at it and crawl back ,— and He will not know . But I shall know and become a God , become a God , a God ! I have so long wanted to become a God — and would I be a poor God ? Look !</stage>
    <stage>He assumes a haughty pose , but immediately bursts into laughter . Then he sits down calmly on a flat rock and , folding his legs under him , takes out dice . He mutters something to himself , yet loud enough to be heard by the Guardian of the Entrances .</stage>
    <stage>If you do n't want to you need not do it ,— I shall not fight with you . Have I come here for that purpose ? I simply roamed about the world and came here by mere accident — I have nothing to do , so I roam about . And now I am going to throw dice . If He were not so serious , I would have invited Him , too ,— but He is too proud , too proud , and He does not understand the pleasure of the game . Six , eight , twenty — correct ! It 's always correct when the Devil plays , even when he plays honestly .... David Leizer ... David Leizer ...</stage>
    <stage>Turning to the Guardian of the Entrances , he speaks freely .</stage>
    <stage>Do you know David Leizer ? You surely do not know him . He is a sick and foolish old Jew , whom no one knows , and even your Master has forgotten about him . So says David Leizer , and I cannot help believing him — he is a foolish , but honest man . He is the man I have won just now with my dice — you saw it : six , eight , twenty .... One day I met David Leizer by the seashore , when he was questioning what the waves were complaining of ; and I liked him . He is a foolish , but honest man , and if he should be well tarred and lighted , he would make a brilliant torch for my feast .</stage>
    <stage>Chatting with feigned ease , he steps over softly to the rock nearest the Guardian .</stage>
    <stage>No one knows David Leizer , but I shall make him famous , I shall make him mighty and great — it is very possible that I shall even make him immortal ! You do not believe me ? No one believes the wise Anathema , even when he speaks the truth — and who loves the truth more than Anathema does ? Perhaps you ? You silent dog , you who have stolen the truth from the world , you who have barred the entrances with iron !...</stage>
    <stage>He rushes furiously toward the Guardian of the Entrances , but retreats from the stern , motionless Guardian , with a shriek of horror and pain . And he speaks plaintively , falling with his grey chest upon the grey rock .</stage>
    <stage>Oh , the Devil 's hair is grey ! Weep , you who have grown fond of Anathema ! Wail and grieve , you who are striving toward Truth , who are honoring wisdom — Anathema 's hair is grey ! Who will help the son of Dawn ? He is alone in the universe . Wherefore , O Great One , have you frightened the fearless Anathema — he did not intend to strike you , he only wanted to approach you . May I come over to you ? Tell me .</stage>
    <stage>The Guardian of the Entrances is silent , but to Anathema it seems that he hears something in the silence . Outstretching his serpentine neck , he shouts passionately .</stage>
    <stage>Louder ! Louder ! Are you silent , or did you speak ? I do not understand . The accursed one has a sensitive ear and discerns the shades of certain words in your silence ; he feels a vague movement of thoughts in your motionlessness ,— but he does not understand . Did you speak or are you silent ? Did you say : “ Come , ” or did it only sound so to me ?</stage>
    <p>THE GUARDIAN .</p>
    <stage>Come .</stage>
    <p>ANATHEMA .</p>
    <stage>You said it , but I dare not come up to you .</stage>
    <p>GUARDIAN .</p>
    <stage>Come .</stage>
    <p>ANATHEMA .</p>
    <stage>I am afraid .</stage>
    <stage>He advances toward the Guardian irresolutely , in zigzag movements ; lies down on his belly and crawls , wailing with longing and fear .</stage>
    <stage>Oh , I the prince of darkness , wise and powerful , and yet you see — I am crawling on my belly like a dog . And I am doing it because I love you , I want to kiss the hem of your cloak . But why does my old heart ache so much ? Tell me , Omniscient .</stage>
    <p>GUARDIAN .</p>
    <stage>The accursed one has no heart .</stage>
    <p>ANATHEMA .</p>
    <stage>Advancing .</stage>
    <stage>Yes , yes . The accursed has no heart , his chest is mute and motionless like the grey rock which does not breathe . Oh , if Anathema had a heart , you would have destroyed him long ago by his sufferings , even as you destroy the foolish man . But Anathema has a mind that is searching for the Truth , unprotected against your blows — spare it .... Here I am at your feet , reveal your face to me . Only for an instant , as brief as the flash of lightning ,— reveal your face to me .</stage>
    <stage>He cringes servilely at the feet of the Guardian , not daring , however , to touch his cloak . He is vainly endeavoring to lower his eyes , which are quick and searching , sharp , flashing like coals beneath grey ashes . The Guardian is silent and Anathema continues his fruitless and persistent entreaties .</stage>
    <stage>Do you not want to do it ? Then call the name of Him who is beyond the Gates . Call it in a soft voice , and no one will hear it ; only I will know it , the wise Anathema , longing for Truth . Is it not true that it consists of seven letters ? Or of six ? Or of one ? Tell me . Only one letter — and you will save the accursed one from eternal tortures , and the earth , which I am tearing with my nails , will bless you . You may say it softly , softly , you may only breathe it , and I shall understand it , and I shall bless you .... Tell me .</stage>
    <stage>The Guardian is silent , and Anathema , after some hesitation , full of fury , crawls away slowly , growing holder with every step .</stage>
    <stage>It is not true that I love you .... It is not true that I wanted to kiss the hem of your cloak .... I feel sorry for you , if you believed me .... I simply have nothing to do , so I roam about in the world .... I have nothing to do , so I question the passers-by about this and that ,— about things I know myself .... I know everything !</stage>
    <stage>He rises , shakes himself like a dog that has just come out of the water , and choosing the highest rock , stands up there in a haughty , actorlike pose .</stage>
    <stage>I know everything . With my wisdom I have penetrated the meaning of all things , the laws of numbers are known to me , and the book of Fates is open to me . At one glance I embrace life , I am the axis in the circle of time , which whirls rapidly . I am great , I am mighty , I am immortal , and man is in my power . Who will dare struggle with the Devil ? The strong , I kill , and the weak I force to whirl about in an intoxicating dance , a mad dance , a devilish dance . I have poisoned all the sources of life , on all its roads I have built ambuscades .... Do you hear the voice of those who curse ? The voice of those who are exhausted under the burden of evil ? Of those who dare in vain ? Of those who long endlessly and terribly ?</stage>
    <p>GUARDIAN .</p>
    <stage>I do .</stage>
    <p>ANATHEMA .</p>
    <stage>Laughing .</stage>
    <stage>The name ! Call the name ! Illumine the way for the Devil and for man . All in the world want goodness , but know not where to find it ; all in the world want fife , but meet only death . The name ! Call the name of goodness , call the name of eternal life . I am waiting !</stage>
    <p>GUARDIAN .</p>
    <stage>There is no name for that which you ask , Anathema . There is no number by which to count , no measure by which to measure , no scales by which to weigh that which you ask , Anathema . Every one who has said the word , Love , has lied . Every one who has said the word , Wisdom ,— has lied . And even he who has uttered the word , God ,— has lied with the greatest and most terrible lie . For there is no number , no measure , no scale , no name for that which you ask , Anathema .</stage>
    <p>ANATHEMA .</p>
    <stage>Where shall I go ? Tell me .</stage>
    <p>GUARDIAN .</p>
    <stage>Where you are going .</stage>
    <p>ANATHEMA .</p>
    <stage>What shall I do ? Tell me .</stage>
    <p>GUARDIAN .</p>
    <stage>What you are doing .</stage>
    <p>ANATHEMA .</p>
    <stage>You speak through silence — can I understand the language of your silence ? Tell me .</stage>
    <p>GUARDIAN .</p>
    <stage>No . Never . My face is open , but you see it not . My speech is loud , but you hear it not . My commands are clear , but you know them not , Anathema . And you shall never see , and you shall never hear , and you shall never know , Anathema , unfortunate spirit , deathless in numbers , eternally alive in measures and in weights , but as yet unborn to life .</stage>
    <p>ANATHEMA .</p>
    <stage>Tormented .</stage>
    <stage>Never ?</stage>
    <p>GUARDIAN .</p>
    <stage>Never .</stage>
    <stage>Anathema leaps down from the rocks , and tosses about madly , devoured by grief . Clinging to the rocks , he embraces them tenderly and then pushes them away angrily ; he moans bitterly . He turns his face to West and East , to North and South of the earth , flourishing his arms , as if calling the earth to wrath and vengeance . But the grey rocks are silent , West and East are silent , North and South are silent , and in stern motionlessness , heavily leaning on his sword , stands the Guardian of the Entrances .</stage>
    <p>ANATHEMA .</p>
    <stage>Rise , O Earth ! Rise , O Earth , and gird your sword , O man . There will be no peace between you and Heaven ; the earth is becoming the abode of darkness and death , and the Prince of Darkness ascends to his throne upon it — from now on and forever . I am going to you , David . I will hurl your sad life towards the proud heaven like a stone from a sling — and the foundations of the high heavens will tremble . My slave , David ! With your lips I will proclaim the truth about the fate of man .</stage>
    <stage>He turns to the Guardian of the Entrances .</stage>
    <stage>And you !...</stage>
    <stage>He becomes silent , bashfully , confused by the Silence . He stretches himself lazily , as from tediousness , and mutters in a voice loud enough to be heard by the Guardian of the Entrances .</stage>
    <stage>But am I not roaming about , because I have nothing to do ? I have been here , and now I shall go there . Are there not plenty of roads for the gay Anathema , who is fond of healthy laughter and a carefree jest ? Six .... That means that I bring to David a fortune which he does not expect .... Eight .... That means that David Leizer is healing the sick and reviving the dead . Twenty .... Correct ! That means ... That means that David and I come to express our gratitude . David Leizer , the great , the powerful , the immortal David Leizer and I .... I am going .</stage>
    <stage>Anathema departs .</stage>
    <stage>Silence . The rocks are silent ; the mute Gates , pressing the earth with their enormous weight , are silent ; the Guardian , petrified , is silent .</stage>
    <stage>Silence . But did not Anathema 's footsteps awaken an alarming , resounding echo ? One , two — some heavy steps are heard coming . It is like one footstep , but many people are coming ; they are silent , but the silence is already quivering . A momentary confusion of sounds , of helplessness and tremulous outbursts , and suddenly the silence breaks out in high yellow flames of fire : somewhere below , in the invisible distance , on earth , long trumpets , carried by hands uplifted high , are blaring in rebellious , brasslike tones ,— their defiant cry of revolt is turned both to earth and to Heaven .</stage>
    <stage>One , two ,— now it is clear that a crowd is moving ; its monstrous voice , its blended and separate sobs , its noisy and stormy speech is heard ; and below , in the labyrinth from broken and dark passages , the first distinct sound rings out : “ Da-a-vid ! ” It grows more distinct , rises higher , and now it soars overhead-on the wings of this brass fanfare , above the heavy stamping of the marching feet .</stage>
    <stage>“ Da-a-vid ! Da-a-a-vid ! Da-a-a-vid ! ”</stage>
    <stage>The sounds blend harmoniously . They become the song of millions of people . The trumpets are blaring , exhausted ; they call hoarsely with their brass voices —</stage>
    <stage>Does the Guardian of the Entrances hear them ? The grey rocks are covered with moans ; passionate sobs rise to His feet , but the Guardian is motionless , the Guardian is speechless , and the iron Gates are mute .</stage>
    <stage>The abyss crashes .</stage>
    <stage>With one blow , as if splitting the earth , a brass roar and shout breaks forth ,— and out of the fragments , like a spring from a rock that is split by lightning , a soft , harmonious , bright melody comes forth .</stage>
    <stage>Then it dies out .</stage>
    <stage>Silence . Immobility . Expectation , expectation , expectation .</stage>
    <p>CURTAIN</p>

    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>The south of Russia . A hot summer midday . A wide road near the end of a large , thickly populated city . Starting from the left corner of the stage , the road crosses it diagonally , turning in the rear of the stage to the right . Two high stone posts , of ancient construction , dilapidated and slightly bent , indicate the boundary of the city . On the side of the city line , at the right post , there is a deserted , once yellow sentry-box , the plaster fallen of in spots and the windows tightly boarded and nailed up . On the sides of the road there are several small shops made of cheap wood , separated from one another by narrow passages — in the desperate and ineffectual struggle for existence the little shops seem to be clambering stupidly upon one another . The people are dealing in all sorts of merchandise : candies , sunflower seeds , cheap sausages , herrings ; each shop has a small , dirty counter , through which a pipe with two faucets stands out prominently — one of them for soda-water , at a penny a glass ,— the other for seltzer . One of the little shops belongs to David Leizer ; the others — to the Greek Purikes , to the young Jewess Sonka Zitron , and to the Russian , Ivan Bezkrainy , who , in addition to his business , mends shoes and rubbers ; he is the only one who has “ real noblemen 's ” cider for sale .</stage>
     <stage>The sun is burning mercilessly and the few small trees , with their leaves curled up from the heat , are pining for rain ; the dusty road is deserted . Beyond the posts , where the road is turning toward the right , there is a high precipice — the dust-covered tops of trees are seen here and there in the descending distance . And embracing the entire horizon , the sea has stretched itself in a smoky blue strip , sleeping peacefully in the heat and glare of the sun .</stage>
     <stage>Sarah , David Leizer 's wife , an old Jewess , exhausted by life , is seated in front of her little shop . She is mending some rags and is chatting languidly with the other shopkeepers .</stage>
    </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>No one is buying anything . No one is drinking any soda-water ; no one is buying any sunflower seeds or any fine candies which melt in the mouth .</p>

     <p>One might think that all the people have died so as not to buy anything . One might think that we remained alone with our stores in the whole world — we alone in the whole world .</p>

     <p>BEZKRAINY . The sun has burnt all the customers — only the shopkeepers remained . Silence . The soft sobbing of Sonka is heard .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BEZKRAINY</speaker>
     <p>Sonka , yesterday you bought a chicken . Did you kill or rob anybody that you can afford to buy chickens ? And if you are so rich and you hide your money , why do you deal here and hinder us from making a living ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>BEZKRAINY</speaker>
     <p>Sonka , I am asking you ,— is it true that you bought a chicken yesterday ? Do n't lie , I know it from trustworthy people . Sonka maintains silence , weeping .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>When a Jew buys a chicken , it is because either the Jew is sick or the chicken is sick . Sonka Zitron 's son is dying ; yesterday he commenced to die and to-day he will end it — the boy is tenacious and he is dying slowly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BEZKRAINY</speaker>
     <p>Why did she come here if her son is dying ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Because it is necessary to trade .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PURIKES</speaker>
     <p>It is necessary to trade . Sonka is weeping .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Yesterday we ate nothing , we waited for to-day ; and to-day we will eat nothing , waiting that to-morrow will bring us customers and happiness . Happiness ! Who knows what is happiness ? All people are equal before God , and yet one sells two cents ’ worth , while another sells thirty cents ’ worth . And one always two cents ’ worth , while the other always thirty cents ’ worth , and no one knows why happiness is given to a person .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BEZKRAINY</speaker>
     <p>I used to sell thirty cents ’ worth , and now I sell only two cents ’ worth . At that time I had no “ noblemen 's ” cider , and now I have it , and yet I sell only two cents ’ worth now . Luck is changeable !</p>

     <p>Yesterday my son Naum came and asked me : “ Mother , where is father ? ” So I said to him : “ What for do you want to know where father is ? David Leizer , your father , is a sick , unfortunate man , who is going to die soon ; and he goes to the seashore to commune in solitude with God about his fate . Do n't disturb your father , he is going to die soon — you had better tell me what you want to say . ” And Naum answered : “ I will tell you , mother ,— I am beginning to die ! ” That is what Naum answered . When David Leizer , my old husband , came home , I said to him : “ You are still steadfast in your uprightness ! Blaspheme God and die ! For your son Naum is already beginning to die . ” Sonka is weeping more loudly .</p>

      <l>With alarm .</l>
      <l>How is it possible that people should stop buying things altogether ?</l>
      <l>That 's impossible !</l>

     <p>That 's impossible .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PURIKES</speaker>
     <p>It is possible . Suddenly everybody may stop buying things . All are seized with horror ; even Sonka stops weeping , and pale-faced , she surveys the deserted road with her frightened , dark eyes . The sun is burning mercilessly . Anathema appears in the distance , at the turn of the road .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>SONKA</speaker>
     <p>A customer ! A customer ! She cries again . Anathema comes nearer to them . Notwithstanding the heat , he wears a black coat of fine cloth , a black silk hat , black gloves ; only his necktie is white , lending a solemn air to his costume . He is tall , and , though grey-haired , straight and stately . The face of the accursed one is of a swarthy-grey color ; his features are stern and of peculiar beauty . When Anathema takes off his hat , his enormous forehead is revealed , furrowed by wrinkles . His head is unusually large and his greyish black hair is dishevelled . Anathema 's neck is wiry and strong , but it is rather thin and long , and in his nervous contortions he carries his head like a heavy weight , giving it the appearance of strange inquisitiveness , restlessness and malignity .</p>

     <speaker>PURIKES</speaker>
     <p>Joyously . A customer ! A customer ! Please do n't buy anything from me , you need n't buy anything from me ,— all I want is to look at you . Sonka , do you see ? A buyer !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SONKA</speaker>
     <p>I do n't see anything . I can n't see . Anathema lifts his hatband bows to all kindly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Thank you . I will drink a glass of soda-water with pleasure , and perhaps even a glass of your noblemen 's cider . But I should like to know where David Leizer 's business place is .</p>

     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Surprised .</l>
      <l>It is here . Do you want David ? I am his wife , Sarah .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Yes , madam Leizer , I want to see David , David Leizer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Suspiciously . You have come with bad news : David has no friends that wear clothes of such fine cloth as you wear . If that is so , you had better go away . David is not here , and I will not tell you where he is .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Heartily . Oh , no , madam , do n't be uneasy ; I am not bringing you any bad news . But how pleasant it is to see such love .— Do you love your husband very much , madam Leizer ? He must be a very strong and healthy man , earning much money .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Frowning . No , he is sick and old and unable to work . But he has not sinned against God or man in any way , and even his enemies dare not say anything bad about him . Here is some seltzer , sir , it is better than soda . And if you are not afraid of the heat , I would ask you to sit down and wait a while ; David will soon be here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Sitting down . Yes , I have heard many good things about your husband , but I did not know that he was so feeble and old . Have you any children , madam Leizer ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>We had six , but the first four died ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Nods his head compassionately .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Yes , we lived miserably , sir . And we have only two left . Our son Naum ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BEZKRAINY</speaker>
     <p>A good-for-nothing , who makes believe that he is sick and saunters about the city all day long .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Stop , Ivan , are n't you ashamed to slander honest people ? Naum is going around because he has to get credit . Then , sir , we have a daughter , and her name is Rosa . But unfortunately she is too beautiful , too beautiful , sir . Happiness what is happiness ? One person dies of smallpox , while another person needs smallpox , but it would not come , and the face is as pure as a flower leaf .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Feigning amazement . Why are you so sorry about it ? Beauty is a gift from God , which He has bestowed upon man , whom he has thus elevated and brought nearer to Himself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Who knows ? It may be a gift from God , and it may be a gift from somebody else of whom I would not speak . But there is one thing I do not know ; why has a man beautiful eyes , if he must hide them ? Why has he a white face , if he must cover it with soot and filth ? Beauty is a too dangerous treasure , for it is easier to hide money from a robber , than beauty from a wicked man .<stage>Suspiciously .</stage>Did you come perhaps to see Rosa ? Then you better go away ,— Rosa is not here , and I will not tell you where she is .</p>

     <p>A buyer . Sarah , look , a buyer is here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes , Purikes . But he will not buy that which he has come for , and he will not find that which he is seeking . Anathema smiles good-naturedly and listens attentively to the conversation ; every time some one begins to speak , he stretches his neck and turns his head to the speaker , holding it slightly bent on one side . He makes grimaces like an actor , expressing now amazement , now sorrow or indignation . He laughs , inappropriately , thereby frightening and surprising the people .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BEZKRAINY</speaker>
     <p>Sarah , you are making a mistake in valuing your goods too highly and not selling when people are ready to buy . Every article loses its value if you keep it too long .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Tearfully . What a wicked man you are , Ivan . I gave you credit for ten copecks , and you are forever slandering us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BEZKRAINY</speaker>
     <p>Do n't pay any attention to me , Sarah ,— I am wicked because I am hungry . You , sir , in that black coat , go away : Sarah is an honest woman and she will not sell her daughter to you , even if you offered her a million .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Hotly . That 's right , Ivan , thank you . But who told you , sir , that our Rosa is beautiful ? It is not true — do n't laugh , it is n't true , she is as ugly as deadly sin . She is as filthy as a dog that has just crawled out of the coal-hole of a ship ; her face is furrowed by smallpox and it looks like a field where people dig lime and sand ; there is on her right eye a cataract as large as on an old horse . Look at her hair — it is like faded wool , half torn away by birds ; and when she walks , she stoops ,— I swear to you , she stoops when she walks ! If you take her , everybody will laugh at you , everybody will spit at you , the street urchins will give you no rest ....</p>

     <p>But you yourself —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Imploringly . Have I said anything ? My God , women are so talkative , sir ; and they love their children so dearly that they always consider them beautiful . Rosa — beautiful !<stage>Laughs .</stage>Just think of it , Purikes ,— Rosa is beautiful ! She laughs . Rosa comes over from the direction of the city . Her hair is disheveled , almost covering her black , flashing eyes ; her face is smeared with something black , and she is dressed wretchedly . She walks with a youthful and stately gait , but on noticing the strange man , she stoops like an old woman .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Here , here is Rosa ; look , sir ! My God , how ugly she is . David cries every time he sees her .</p>

     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Persuasively . What are you saying , Rosa ? There is no uglier girl than you in the whole world .<stage>Whispers entreatingly .</stage>Hide your beauty , Rosa . A robber has come , Rosa ,— hide your beauty ! At night I will wash your face myself , I will comb your braids myself , and you will be as beautiful as a heavenly angel , and we will all pray to you . A robber has come , Rosa .<stage>Aloud .</stage>Did they throw stones at you again ?</p>

      <l>Yes , they did .</l>

     <p>And the dogs attacked you , too ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROSA</speaker>
     <p>Yes , they did .—</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>So you see , sir ? Even the dogs !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>In a friendly tone . Yes , it seems that I have made a mistake . To my regret , your daughter is really not pretty and it is painful to look at her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Of course , there are uglier girls than she is , but — Go , Rosochka , go over there , take your work — What is there for a poor and ugly girl to do but work ? Go , my poor Rosochka , go . Rosa takes some rags to mend and disappears behind the counter . Silence .</p>

     <p>Calmed down . Thirty years already , ever since David became sick . A misfortune happened to him when he served in the army ,— he was trampled by horses and they crushed his chest .</p>

     <p>What injustice !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BEZKRAINY</speaker>
     <p>Have you ever met justice in the world ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Of course I have . You are no doubt an unfortunate man , and everything appears to you in dark colors . But you will see , you will soon see , that justice does exist .<stage>Freely .</stage>The devil take it , I have nothing to do , so I always roam about the world , and I have not seen anything so plentiful as justice . How shall I say it , madam Leizer ? There is more justice on earth than fleas on a good dog .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Smiling . But what if it is just as hard to catch justice as to catch fleas ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BEZKRAINY</speaker>
     <p>And what if it bites just as the fleas do ? All laugh . From the side of the city appears an organ-grinder , exhausted , half-blinded from dust and perspiration . He wants to pass by , but suddenly he pauses in despair , and begins to play a terrible tune .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>What a kind-hearted man you are . Go , musician , eat and drink . But for the water I will not take anything from you — let the water be mine . The organ-grinder sits down and eats ravenously .</p>

     <speaker>ORGAN-GRINDER</speaker>
     <p>Morosely , I used to have a monkey before — music and a monkey . The monkey was eaten up by the fleas , and my music box started to screech , and I am looking for a tree on which to hang myself . That is all . A little girl runs in . She looks curiously at the organ-grinder , then turns to Sonka .</p>

     <p>Closing her store . You may . Sarah , if a customer comes , tell him that I will attend to business to-morrow again , otherwise he may think that my store is closed for good . Have you heard it ? Ruzya died .</p>

     <p>Sonka , here is a rouble for you ; you see , a rouble ?</p>

     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>It would be too much honor for me and for you , madam Leizer , if I came from God . No , I have come of my own accord . Naum comes over , looks at the customer with amazement , and sits down , exhausted , upon a rock . Naum is a tall , thin young man , with a narrow chest and a large , pale nose . He looks around on all sides .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>NAUM</speaker>
     <p>Slowly . No , mother , I did not get any credit . I am beginning to die , mother ,— everybody feels hot , while I am very cold ; and I am perspiring , but my perspiration is cold . I met Sonka — Ruzya died already .</p>

     <p>Why not , madam Leizer ? Do you fear that God will give him a bad answer ? You should have more faith , madam Leizer . If David heard you , he would not approve your words .</p>

      <l>Raising his head .</l>
      <l>Is it you , young man , who wants to speak to God ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NAUM</speaker>
     <p>Yes , it is I . Every man can speak with God .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ORGAN-GRINDER</speaker>
     <p>Do you think so ? Then ask for a new organ . Tell Him that this one is screeching .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Compassionately . He might add that the monkey was eaten up by the fleas — that he needs a new monkey . He laughs . All look at him in perplexity ; the organ-grinder rises and takes up his organ silently .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>What do you want to do , musician ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ORGAN-GRINDER</speaker>
     <p>I want to play .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>What for ? We do n't need any music .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ORGAN-GRINDER</speaker>
     <p>I must thank you for your kindness . He plays something weird : the organ screeches , breaks off , wheezes . Anathema , with eyes lifted dreamily to the sky , keeps time with his hand , and whistles .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>My God , how badly it sounds .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>This , madam Leizer<stage>whistles</stage>,— this is called the world harmony . The conversation dies away for some time : only the screeching of the organ and the whistling of Anathema are heard . The sun is still shining mercilessly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>I have nothing to do , so I wander over the world . He is carried away by the playing of the organ . Suddenly the organ breaks off with a screech , which rings in the ears for a long time , and Anathema remains as petrified with uplifted hand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Perplexedly .</l>
      <l>Does it always end like this ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ORGAN-GRINDER</speaker>
     <p>Sometimes even worse . Good-by .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Feeling his vest pocket . No , no , you must n't go away like that .... You have afforded us genuine pleasure , and I do not want you to hang yourself . Here is some change for you , and live on .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Pleasantly surprised . Who could ever think , by looking at your face , that you are such a cheerful and kind-hearted man ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Flattered . Oh , do not embarrass me with your praise , madam Leizer . Why should n't I help a poor man who would otherwise hang himself ! The life of man is a precious thing , madam Leizer ,— and I always carry change with me .... But is n't that venerable man I see there David Leizer ? He looks in the direction where the road turns to the right .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Also looking at the road . Yes , that is David . All wait silently . On the dust-covered road appears David Leizer , walking slowly . He is tall , bony , with long , grey locks and a grey beard ; on his head he wears a high , black cap ; in his hand a staff with which he seems to measure the road . He looks down from under his heavy eyebrows ; and thus , without lifting his eyes , he advances slowly and seriously to the people , and stops , leaning upon the staff with both hands .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Rising respectfully .</l>
      <l>Where were you , David ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Not lifting his eyes .</l>
      <l>I was by the sea .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>What did you do there , David ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>I looked at the waves , Sarah , and asked them whence they came and whither they were going . I was thinking of life , Sarah — whence it came and whither it is going ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>What did the waves tell you , David ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>They did not tell me anything , Sarah .... They come and go away again , and the man by the sea is waiting in vain for an answer from the sea .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>With whom did you speak , David ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>I spoke with God , Sarah . I asked Him about the fate of David Leizer , the poor Jew who is going to die soon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>With emotion .</l>
      <l>And what did God tell you ?</l>
      <l>David is silent , his eyes lowered .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Our son Naum also wants to go with you to the sea and ask about his fate .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Lifting his eyes .</l>
      <l>Is Naum going to die soon ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NAUM</speaker>
     <p>Yes , father ,— I have already commenced to die .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>But , pardon me , gentlemen .... Why should you speak of death , since I have brought you life and happiness ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Turning his head to him .</l>
      <l>Do you come from God ? Sarah , who is he who dares to speak like this ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know . He has been waiting for you a long time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Bustling about joyously . Oh , ladies and gentlemen , smile . Attention for one minute and I will make you all laugh . Attention , gentlemen . Attention ! All look with tense attention at Anathema 's mouth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Taking out a paper , solemnly .</l>
      <l>Are you not David Leizer , the son of Abraham Leizer ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LEIZER</speaker>
     <p>Frightened . Well , yes , I am . But there may be another David Leizer . I do n't know — ask the people .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Interrupting him with a gesture . Did n't you have a brother , Moses Leizer , who fled to America thirty-five years ago on the Italian steamship Fortuna ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALL</speaker>
     <p>Yes , he did .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>But I did not know that he was in America .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>David Leizer , your brother Moses died !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Silence</speaker>
     <p>DAVID . I have long forgiven him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>And before he died he bequeathed all his fortune , amounting to two million dollars<stage>to the people surrounding him</stage>, which means four million roubles ,— to you , David Leizer . A deep sigh goes through the crowd and all seem as petrified .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Outstretching the paper .</l>
      <l>Here is the document , you see — the seal .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Pushing the paper aside . No , do n't ! Do n't do that ! You were not sent by God . God would not make sport of man in this way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Heartily . This is not a jest . Upon my honor , it is the truth ,— four millions . Allow me to be the first to congratulate you and to shake your honest hand warmly .<stage>Takes David Leizer 's hand and shakes it .</stage>Well , madam Leizer , what have I brought you ? And what will you say now ? Is your daughter Rosa beautiful now or is she ugly ? Aha ! Are you going to die so soon , Naum ? Aha !<stage>Tearfully .</stage>That 's what I have brought you , people , and now permit me to step aside — and not to disturb you — Lifts a handkerchief to his eyes and steps aside , apparently agitated .</p>

     <p>Wash your face ! Wash your face , Rosa ! My God , quicker , quicker ,— wash your face ! As though insane , she drags Rosa , washes her , splashing the water with trembling hands . Naum clings to his father 's arm , hanging on to it , as though he is about to lose consciousness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Take back your paper !<stage>Firmly .</stage>Take back your paper !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>NAUM</speaker>
     <p>Seizing the paper . It is ours , father . Father ,— this is how God has answered you . Look at mother , look at Rosa — look at me : I was already commencing to die .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PURIKES</speaker>
     <p>Shouts . Ai , Ai , look out , they 'll tear the paper . Ai , Ai , take away the paper from them , quick ! Naum cries , Rosa , radiantly beautiful , her hair wet , but no longer covering her eyes , comes over to her father , laughing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROSA</speaker>
     <p>It is I , father ! It is I ! It is — I !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>ROSA</speaker>
     <p>I was n't — I 've just been born , mamma !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>See , David , see — a human being has just been born ! Oh , look at her , every one of you ! Oh , open the doors of your vision , throw open the gates of your eyes — look at her , every one of you ! Suddenly David realizes the meaning of what has happened . He throws his cap from his head , tears his clothing , which seems to suffocate him , and pushing everybody aside , rushes to Anathema .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Sternly .</l>
      <l>Why have you brought this ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Meekly .</l>
      <l>But , pardon me , Mr. Leizer , I am only a lawyer . I am sincerely glad .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Why have you brought this ? He pushes Anathema aside , and reeling , goes to the road . Suddenly he stops , turns around and shouts , flourishing his hands .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>I Drive him away — that is the Devil . Do you think he brought me four million roubles ? No , he brought me four million insults . Four million mockeries he hurled upon the head of David ... Four oceans of bitter tears have I shed over life , my sighs were four winds of the earth , my four children were devoured by hunger and diseases — and now , when I must die , he brings me four millions . Will they return to me my youth which I passed in privation , oppressed with grief , wrapped with sorrows , crowned with anguish ? Will they repay me for one day of my starvation , one tear that fell upon a rock , one insult hurled at my face ? Four million curses — that 's what your four million roubles are — oh , Hannah , oh , Benjamin , and Raphael , and my little Moishe ,— you , my little birdies , who died of hunger upon the naked branches of winter — what will you say if your father should touch this money ? No , I do n't need any money . I am telling you — I , an old Jew , dying of hunger . I do n't need any money . I do n't see God in this . But I shall go to Him , I shall tell Him : What are you doing with David ?— I am going . Goes away , brandishing his hands .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>

     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Turns around . Calm yourself , madam Leizer , he will come back . It is always thus at first . I have wandered a great deal over the world and I know it . The blood rushes to the head , the feet begin to quiver , and man curses . That 's nonsense !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROSA</speaker>
     <p>What a crooked mirror , mother !</p>

     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Throw away that piece of glass , Rosa . Mankind will reflect your beauty , the world will reflect your beauty — you will see yourself in the world .... Ah , you are still here , musician . Play something for us , please . Such a holiday must not pass without music !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ORGAN-GRINDER</speaker>
     <p>Shall I play the same ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>The same . The organ wails and wheezes . Anathema whistles furiously , waving his hands , as though blessing everybody with the music and the whistling .</p>

    <head type="act">ACT TWO .</head>
    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>David Leizer lives richly . At the urgent request of his wife and his children he has hired a rich villa , by the sea-shore , engaged numerous servants , bought horses and carriages . Anathema , under the pretext that he had grown tired of his law practice , remained with David as his private secretary . Rosa is taking lessons in languages and deportment . Naum , who has grown very sick , near to death , is learning how to dance . The money has not yet arrived from America , but to David Leizer , the millionaire , a large credit has been extended .</stage>
     <stage>The stage represents a rich parlor , white marble here and there , with large Italian windows and a door leading to a veranda . It is midday . Beyond the open windows , semi-tropical plants are visible , and the deep blue sea in the distance ; through one of the windows , a view of the city is seen .</stage>
     <stage>David Leizer is seated by the table , greatly depressed . A short distance away , on a divan , Sarah is seated , dressed richly , but without taste ; she watches Naum learning how to dance . Naum is very pale , he coughs and almost falls from weakness , especially when , according to the rules of the dance , he must stand on one foot ; but he is studying diligently ! He is dressed rather richly , but his bright-colored vest and necktie spoil the elegance of his appearance . Near Naum , the dancing-master , with a fiddle and how , is hustling about , balancing himself , rising up and down . He is a man of unusual refinement and grace ; he wears a white vest , patent-leather slippers , and a smoking jacket . And Anathema , standing at the veranda door , looks upon all this with an air of sadness and reproach .</stage>

     <speaker>DANCING-MASTER</speaker>
     <p>One — two — three ; one — two — three .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Look , David , see how successful our Naum is in his dancing . I could not hop like that for anything ? poor boy !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>I see .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANCING-MASTER</speaker>
     <p>Monsieur Naum is very talented . Please , one-two — three ; one — two — three . Pardon me , pardon me , this is n't exactly right . You must make the step more precise , neatly rounding the motion of the right foot . This way — this way . Shows him how to do it . Madam Leizer , dancing is quite like mathematics , a circle is necessary .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Please , monsieur Naum . One — two — three . Plays on his violin .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NAUM</speaker>
     <p>Out of breath . One , two , three . One , two , three . One , two , three . He turns around , and then , suddenly , almost falls down . He stops . His face is exhausted , deathly pale ; he is seized with a fit of coughing . Then he resumes dancing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NAUM ,</speaker>
     <p>One , two , three .</p>

     <speaker>DANCING-MASTER</speaker>
     <p>That 's the way , that 's the way , monsieur Naum . Please , more neatly ! More neatly , please ! One , two , three . He plays . Anathema walks over to Sarah cautiously and says in a low voice , yet loud enough to be heard by David :</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Madam Leizer , does it not seem to you that Naum is rather tired ? This dancing-master knows no mercy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Turning around .</l>
      <l>Yes , it is enough . Sarah , you are willing to torture the boy .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Confusedly . What have I to do with it , David ? Do n't I see that he is tired , but he wants to dance ? Naum , Naum !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Enough , Naum ! Take a rest .</p>

      <l>I want to dance .</l>
      <l>Stops and stamps his foot hysterically .</l>
      <l>Why am I not allowed to dance ? Or do you all want me to die soon ?</l>
     </lg>

    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>You will live yet , Naum . You will live yet .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NAUM</speaker>
     <p>Almost crying . Why do n't they allow me to dance ? I want to dance . I have looked for credit long enough , I want to amuse myself . Am I an old man to be in bed and cough there ? Cough ! Cough ! He coughs and cries simultaneously . Anathema whispers something to the dancing-master , who expresses compassion , nods his head , and prepares to go .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DANCING-MASTER</speaker>
     <p>Until to-morrow , monsieur Naum . I am afraid that our lesson was a little too long .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NAUM</speaker>
     <p>To-morrow — do n't fail to come to-morrow . Do you hear ? I want to dance . The dancing-master goes out , bowing . Naum follows him .</p>

     <p>To-morrow , without fail . Do you hear ? Without fail . They go out .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>What are you thinking of , David ? Allow me to be not only your private secretary — although I am proud of this honor — but also your friend . Since the time when you received the money you are oppressed by a dark sorrow , and it pains me to look at you .</p>

     <p>What is there that I should rejoice over , Nullius ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>And Rosa ? Do not sin against God , David ! Do not our eyes rest upon her beauty and youth ? Before even the silent moon dared not look at her , one star dared not whisper about her to any other star ,— while now she is riding about in a carriage , and everybody looks at her , and horsemen gallop after her . Just think of it , Nullius , horsemen gallop after her !</p>

     <p>And Naum ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>What about Naum ? He has long been ill , you know it , and death upon a soft bed is not worse than death upon the pavement . And perhaps he will live yet , he will live yet<stage>cries .</stage>David , Abraham Khessin and Sonka 's girl are waiting for you in the yard .</p>

     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>In the end they will draw out all the money we have , Nullius . I have given to Khessin twice already . He is like sand ,— no matter how much water you pour into it , it is always dry and greedy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Nonsense ! we have too much money , Sarah . But it pains me to look at the people , Nullius . Since the time when you brought us this fortune —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Which you earned by your sufferings , Leizer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Since that time , the people have changed so much for the worse . You like to have the people bow to you very low , Nullius ? I do not like it — human beings are not dogs that they should crawl on their bellies . And you like to have the people tell you , Nullius , that you are the wisest , the most magnanimous , the best of all living beings — whereas you are only an ordinary old Jew , like many another Jew . I do not like it , Nullius ,— for the sons of the God of truth and mercy it is unbecoming to lie , even while dying of the cruelties of truth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Thoughtfully . Riches are a terrible power , Leizer . No one asks you where your money came from ; they see your might and they worship it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Might ? And Naum ? And I , Nullius ? Can I buy for all the money even a single day of health and life ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>You look considerably fresher now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Smiling gloomily . Yes ? Should I , perhaps , also engage a dancing-master ? What do you advise me , Nullius ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Do n't forget Rosa , father . Is it not a great sin against God to hide the beauty of the face ? It is given as a joy and a pleasure to the eyes ; God Himself reveals His beauty in a beautiful face , and did we not lift our hands against God Himself when we stained our Rosa 's face with coal and soot , when we made her terrible and sorrowful to look upon ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Beauty is withering . Everything is dying , Sarah .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>But the lily also withers , and the narcissus dies , the petals of the yellow rose fall apart — would you , David , trample all flowers under foot and heap abuse upon the yellow rose ? Do not doubt , David ,— the God of righteousness has given you riches — will you who were so firm in misfortune that you did not blaspheme God even once — will you grow weak in your happiness ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>You are perfectly right , madam Leizer . Rosa has so many suitors that all she needs is to choose .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Rising angrily .</l>
      <l>I will not give Rosa to any of them .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Why not , David ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>I will not give Rosa to any of them . They are like dogs that want to eat out of the golden bowl — I will drive the dogs away .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Enter Rosa . She is dressed richly , but simply . She is somewhat pale and fatigued , but very beautiful . She tries to speak and to move gracefully , but at times she forgets herself and becomes rude and vociferous . She feds tormented by this . Rosa is accompanied by two horsemen . The older man is very pale and he frowns angrily . Naum clings to Rosa , as though seeking protection in her youth , strength , and beauty , and he walks faintly after her .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>In a rather loud voice .</l>
      <l>Sarah , here are the suitors .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Waving her hand .</l>
      <l>Oh , be silent , David .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROSA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Kissing her mother carelessly .</l>
      <l>How tired I am , mamma . Good afternoon , father .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Take care of yourself , Rosochka ; you must n't study so much . To the older of the two cavaliers . Please tell her that she must n't work so hard — what does she need to work for now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>YOUNG RIDER</speaker>
     <p>In a low voice . People should pray before your daughter , madam Leizer . Soon a temple will be erected in her honor .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLDER RIDER</speaker>
     <p>Smiling . And near the temple , a cemetery . Madam Leizer , there are always cemeteries near the temples .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROSA</speaker>
     <p>Good-by . I am tired . If you are disengaged , come in to-morrow morning — I may go out with you again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLDER RIDER</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Shrugging his shoulders .</l>
      <l>Disengaged ? Oh , yes , of course , we are entirely free .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Harshly</speaker>
     <p>Good-by .</p>

     <speaker>YOUNG RIDER</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>With a sigh .</l>
      <l>Good-by .</l>
      <l>They go out .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Uneasily .</l>
      <l>Rosochka , I think you have offended him . Why did you do it ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROSA</speaker>
     <p>That does n't matter , mamma .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>To David . These are not suitors , David . David laughs morosely . Anathema runs over to Rosa and offers her his arm . He leads her , half-dancing , merrily whistling the same tune that the organ had played .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Rosa , were it not for my age<stage>whistles</stage>and not for my illness<stage>whistles</stage>, I would be the first to ask your hand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROSA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Laughing haughtily .</l>
      <l>Better illness than death .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>You are a very gay man , Nullius .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Whistling . The absence of wealth and , then , a clear conscience , David , a clear conscience . I have nothing to do , so I walk arm in arm with Rosa . You spoke of death , Rosa ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROSA</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Stopping .</l>
      <l>You are indeed beautiful , Rosa .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Thoughtfully</speaker>
     <p>And what if .... If .... But no ; duty above all . Listen to me , Rosa : do n't give yourself away to any one less than a prince , even though the prince of darkness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NAUM</speaker>
     <p>Rosochka , why did you go away from me ? I feel cold when you do not hold my hand . Hold my hand , Rosochka .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROSA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Hesitating .</l>
      <l>But I must go to change my dress , Naum .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NAUM</speaker>
     <p>I will accompany you as far as your room . You know , I danced again to-day and danced very well . I am not so short of breath now any longer . With a feeling of adoration and slight envy . How beautiful you are , Rosochka !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Wait , Rosochka , I will comb your hair myself . Will you allow me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROSA</speaker>
     <p>You do it very badly , mamma ; you kiss it more than you comb it — my hair gets entangled from your kisses .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Is that how you answer your mother , Rosa ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROSA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Stopping .</l>
      <l>Why do you despise my beauty , father ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Before , I used to love your beauty , Rosa .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>With indignation .</l>
      <l>What did you say , David ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Yes , Sarah . I love the pearl when it is on the bottom of the sea ; but after it is taken out of the sea , it becomes blood — and then I do not like pearls , Sarah .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROSA</speaker>
     <p>Why do you despise my beauty , father ? Do you know what another girl in my place would have done ? She would have lost her mind and would have whirled about on earth like a dog that swallowed a pin . But what am I doing ? I am studying , father . I am studying by day and night , father . In great agitation . I do n't know anything . I do n't know how to speak , I do n't even know how to walk — I stoop , I stoop as I walk .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>That is n't true , Rosa .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROSA</speaker>
     <p>Agitated . Here I have forgotten myself for a while , and I am shouting , I am croaking hoarsely , like a crow that has caught cold . I want to be beautiful — that 's what I was born for . You laugh ? It is in vain . Do you know that your daughter will be a duchess , a princess ? I want to add a scepter to my crown !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Oho ! All three go out . David jumps from his seat angrily and paces the room quickly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>What a comedy , Nullius ! Yesterday she begged Heaven for a herring , and to-day a crown is not enough for her . To-morrow she will take the throne away from Satan and will sit upon it , Nullius , and she will sit firmly ! What a comedy ! Anathema has changed the expression of his face ; he is stern and morose .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>No , David Leizer , it is a tragedy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>‘ Tis a comedy , Nullius , a comedy . Do n't you hear the laughter of Satan in all this ? Pointing at the door . You saw a corpse dancing — I see it every morning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Is Naum so dangerously ill ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Dangerously ill ? Three physicians , three serious gentlemen , examined him yesterday and told me quietly that in a month from now Naum will die , that he is already more than half a corpse . And every morning I see in this white marble parlor a corpse jumping to the tune of music — is it not a dream , Nullius ? Is it not the laughter of Satan ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>And what did they say about your health , David ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>I did not ask them . I do n't want them to tell me . You may also jump to the tune of music , David . How would you like it , Nullius : two corpses dancing in a white marble hall ? He laughs bitterly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>You frighten me , my friend . What is going on within your soul ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Do not touch my soul , Nullius — there is horror in it !</l>
      <l>Clasps his head .</l>
      <l>Oh ! what shall I do ? What shall I do ? I am alone in the whole world .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>What ails you , David ? Calm yourself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Stopping before Anathema , horror-stricken . Death , Nullius , death ! You have brought us death . Was I not mute before the face of Death ? Did I not wait for it as for a friend ? But here you have brought us riches — and I want to dance . I want to dance , yet death clutches at my heart ; I want to eat , for hunger has entered my very bones ,— but my old stomach refuses to accept any food ; I want to laugh , but my face is sobbing , my eyes are weeping , and my soul is crying with mortal fear . Hunger has crept into my bones , and poison is already in my blood — there is no salvation for me ; Death has overtaken me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Significantly .</l>
      <l>The poor are waiting for you , David .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>What matters it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>The poor are waiting for you , David .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>The poor are always waiting .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Sternly . Now I see that you are really lost , David . God has forsaken you . David stops and looks at him , surprised and angry . Anathema , with head thrown back haughtily , meets his look calmly and sternly . Silence .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>You say this to me , Nullius ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Yes , I say this to you , David Leizer . Beware , David Leizer , you are in</l>
      <l>Satan 's hands .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Terrified . Nullius , my friend , you frighten me . What have I done to deserve your anger and these cruel , terrible words of yours ? You have always treated me and my children so kindly .... Your hair is just as grey as mine , in your face I have long observed a hidden grief , and — I respect you , Nullius ! Why are you silent ? A terrible fire is burning in your eyes .— Who are you , Nullius ? But you are silent .— No , no , do not lower your eyes , I am even more terrified when they are lowered , for then upon your brow appear fiery letters of some vague — of some terrible — fatal truth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Tenderly .</l>
      <l>David !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Joyously .</l>
      <l>You have started to speak , Nullius .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Be silent and listen to me . From madness I will bring you back to wisdom , from death to life .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>I am silent and I am listening .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Your madness consists of this , David Leizer ,— you have sought for God all your life , and when God came to you , you said : “ I do not know You . ” Your death consists of this , David Leizer ,— blinded by misfortunes , like a horse that is turning around in the darkness , you failed to notice the people and you remained in their midst alone , with your illness and your riches . There in the yard Life is waiting for you — and you , blind man , you close the door against it . Dance , David , dance ,— Death has lifted the bow and is waiting for you . Be more graceful , David Leizer , more graceful ; round out your steps more neatly !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>What do you want of me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Return to God that which God has given to you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Darkly .</l>
      <l>Has God given me anything ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Every rouble in your pocket is a knife which you thrust into the heart of the hungry . Distribute your fortune to the poor , give bread to the hungry , and you will conquer Death .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>No one gave a crust of bread to David when he was hungry . By satisfying their hunger , will I still the hunger that is in my bones ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>In them your own hunger will be stilled .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Shall I get back my health and my strength ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>In them you will be strong .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Shall I drive out death , already in my blood , which is as thin as water , which is already in my veins , that have become hard like dried-up cords ? Shall I recover life ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>By their life you will prolong your life . Now you have but one heart ,</l>
      <l>David ,— but then you will have a million hearts .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>But I shall die !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>No , you will be immortal ! David retreats in horror .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Your lips have uttered a terrible word . Who are you that you dare promise immortality ? Are not life and death in the hand of God ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>God said : Reestablish life through life .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>But people are wicked and vicious , and the hungry one is nearer to God than the well-fed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Remember Hannah and Benjamin ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Be silent !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Remember Raphael and little Moishe ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Grief-stricken .</l>
      <l>Be silent , be silent !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Remember your little birds who died upon the cold branches of winter —</l>
      <l>David cries Utterly .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>When the lark sings in the blue sky , will you say to it : “ Be silent , little bird , God does not need your song ” — And will you not give a kernel to it when it is hungry ? And will you not cover it upon your breast when it is cold , that it may feel warm and save its voice for Spring ? Who are you , then , unfortunate man , who has no pity on birds and who turns children out into the storm ? Remember how your little Moishe died . Remember , David , and say : “ The people are vicious , wicked , and unworthy of my kindness ! ” David bends his knees as under a heavy weight and lifts his hands , as though warding off from his head a blow from the sky . He speaks hoarsely .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Adenoi ! Adenoi ! Anathema , with arms folded on his breast , looks at him in silence .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Mercy ! Mercy !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Quickly .</l>
      <l>David , the poor are waiting for you . They will go away soon .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>No , no !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>The poor are always waiting , but they grow tired of waiting and they go away .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>They will not go away from me . Oh , Nullius , Nullius !... Oh , wise Nullius ! Oh , foolish Nullius ! Is it possible that you did not understand that I have long been waiting for the poor and that their voice is in my ears and in my heart ? When wheels are riding along a dust-covered road , on which rain had just fallen , they think as they turn and leave a trace : Here we are making a road . But the road was there before , Nullius , the road was there before !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Gayly</speaker>
     <p>Call the poor over to me .</p>

     <p>Do not deceive me , David .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>I have never deceived any one , Nullius . Resolutely and majestically . You spoke and I was silent , and I listened ; now be silent and listen to me : I have given my soul not to man but to God , and His power is over me . And I command you : Call my wife Sarah over here , and my children Naum and Rosa , and all the people in my household , whoever they may be .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>And call the poor who are waiting for me in the yard . And when you go out on the street , see whether there are any poor people waiting for me , and if you see them , call them also . For my lips are burning with their thirst , their hunger torments my body with insatiable hunger , and I am hastening to announce to the people my last , unchangeable will . Go !</p>

     <p>The spirit of God has come over me . Adenoi . Adenoi .... Who was the terrible one that spoke through the voice of old Nullius , when he spoke about my little children who died ? Only an arrow out of the bow of the Omniscient strikes the very heart with such good aim . My little birds .... Verily , You have saved me upon the edge of the abyss , and You have torn my spirit away from the clutches of the Devil . He who looks straight at the sun may grow blind , but with the lapse of time the light may come back to the revived eyes ; but he who looks into darkness grows blind forever . My little birds .... Suddenly he laughs softly and joyously , and he whispers . I myself shall bring them bread and milk , I shall hide myself behind the bed-curtain that they should not see me — children are so tender and easily frightened and they are afraid of unfamiliar people ; and I have such a terrible beard .<stage>Laughs .</stage>I shall hide myself behind the bed-curtain and will watch how the children are eating . They need so little ; they eat a little crust of bread and they have enough ; they drink a cup of milk and they know no thirst any longer . Then they sing — But how strange ! does not the night pass away when the sun comes ? do not the waves , at the end of the storm , lie down calmly and quietly like lambs resting in the pasture ? Whence came the alarm , the slight confusion , and the fear ? Shades of unknown woes are passing over my soul and soaring noiselessly over my thoughts . Ah , if I remained poor , if I remained unknown , under the shade of the fence where the refuse is cast away ! You have lifted me to the peak of the mountain and You show my old , sorrowful face to the world . But such is Your will . You will command — and the lamb will become a lion ; You will command — and the furious lion will stretch out her powerful breasts to her little ones ; You will command — and David Leizer , who has grown white in shade , will fearlessly rise to the sun . Adenoi ! Adenoi ! Sarah , Naum , and Rosa enter , alarmed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>David , what is it you have called us for ? And why was your Nullius so strict when he told us of your command ? We have not sinned against you , and if we have sinned , investigate it , but do not look at us so sternly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROSA</speaker>
     <p>May I sit down ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Be silent and wait . All those whom I have called are not here yet . Be seated , Rosa , if you are tired , but when the time comes , rise . You , too , may sit down , Naum . The servants enter irresolutely ; a lackey , resembling an English Minister ; a chamber-maid ; a cook ; a gardener ; a dish-washer , and others . They move about in confusion . Soon about fifteen or twenty poor people enter , in groups . Among them are : Abraham Khessin , an old man ; Sonka 's girl ; Joseph Kritsky , Sarah Lepke , and several other Jews and Jewesses . But there are also Greeks , and Little Russians , and Russians and other paupers whose nationality has been lost in rags and filth ; two drunkards . Purikes , Ivan Bezkrainy , and the Organ-grinder , with the same outworn instrument , are also here . But Anathema is still away .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Please , please . Come in more boldly , do n't stop at the threshold ,— others are coming behind you . But it would be well if you wiped your feet first ; this rich house is not mine , and I must return it as clean as when I took it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KHESSIN</speaker>
     <p>We have not yet learned how to walk on rugs , and we have not yet any patent leather shoes , as your son Naum has . How do you do , David Leizer ? Peace be upon your house .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Peace unto you , too , Abraham . But why do you call me David Leizer , when you used to call me simply David before ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KHESSIN</speaker>
     <p>You are now such a mighty man , David Leizer . Yes , I used to call you merely David before , but here I was waiting for you in the yard , and the longer I waited , the longer your name grew , Mr. David Leizer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>You are right , Abraham : when the sun sets , the shadows become longer , and when a man becomes smaller , his name grows longer . But wait another while , Abraham .</p>

     <p>Mr. Leizer , a certain man , who looked like an old devil , caught me by the collar and said : “ David Leizer , who received an inheritance , is calling you . ” I asked him , “ What for ? ” So he answered : “ David wants to make you his heir , ” and he began to laugh . And now that I came here , your servant is chasing me away .</p>

     <p>Do n't speak , mamma . Do you want , perhaps , to smear my face again with soot ? Pushing several paupers into the door , Anathema enters , apparently fatigued .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Well , David , meanwhile receive these . Your millions frighten the poor , and nobody wanted to follow me , thinking that some deception is hidden here .</p>

     <speaker>DRUNKARD</speaker>
     <p>This is the man who caught me by the collar .</p>

     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Thank you , Nullius . Now take ink and paper and sit down near me , by the table ; bring me my old counting-board .... As everything I am about to say is very important , I ask you to write it correctly and to make no errors — we shall give an account of every word before God . I ask you all to rise and listen attentively , striving to understand the great words which I am about to utter .</p>

     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Solemnly . Upon the death of my brother , Moses Leizer , I received an inheritance<stage>on the counting-board</stage>of two million dollars .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Sternly . Do not interrupt me , Nullius . Yes , it does mean four million roubles . And now , submitting to the voice of my conscience and the command of God , and also in memory of my children , Hannah , Benjamin , Raphael , and Moses , who died of hunger and disease in their childhood .... He lowers his head and weeps bitterly . Sarah also cries bitterly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Oh , my little Moishe ! David , David , our little Moishe is dead .</p>

     <p>Wiping his eyes with a large red handkerchief . Be silent , Sarah . What was I going to say to them , Nullius ?... Well , write , Nullius , write . I know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Firmly</speaker>
     <p>I have resolved , in accordance with the command of God , who is Truth and Mercy , to distribute all my possessions to the poor . Am I speaking properly , Nullius ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>I hear God in your words . At first no one believes David ; but soon joyous doubts and unexpected fear come over them . As though in sleep the people repeat : “ Four millions , four millions ! ” and they hide their faces with their hands . The Organ-grinder comes forward .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Let your hearts rejoice , O unfortunate people , and with a smile on your lips answer the mercy of Heaven . Go from here to the city , like heralds of happiness ,— go through all its streets and squares , and shout everywhere : “ David Leizer , the old Jew , who is to die soon , received an inheritance and now distributes it among the poor . ” And if you will see a man weeping , and a child whose face is bloodless and whose eyes are dim , and a woman whose breasts are shrunken like those of an old goat ,— tell them also : “ Go , David is calling you . ” Do I speak properly , Nullius ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes . But have you called all those who should be called ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>And if you should see an intoxicated man slumbering amidst his vomitings , wake him and tell him : “ Go , David is calling you . ” And if you should see a thief thrashed in the market-place by those he had robbed , call him also , with words of kindness , yet firm enough to be regarded as a command : “ Go , David is calling you . ” And if you should see people who in their misery have become irritated and furious and who are beating one another with sticks and bits of brick , announce to them also in words of peace : “ Go , David is calling you . ” And if you should see a bashful man , who while walking in the wide street lowers his eyes before the eyes of others , but who stares greedily when no one looks at him , tell him also in a low voice , without offending his pride : “ Are you not looking for David ? Go , he has long been waiting for you . ” And if in the evening , when the Devil sows the seeds of night over the earth , you should see a woman , hideously painted , just as the heathen paint the bodies of their dead , and who stares boldly , for she has lost all shame , and who lifts her shoulders , for fear of a blow , tell her also : “ Go , David is calling you . ” Do I speak properly , Nullius ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Yes , David . But have you called all who should be called ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>And whatever form of aversion or fear poverty may assume , and in whatever colors misery may paint itself , and by whatever words suffering may fence itself around , rouse with a loud call those who are fatigued , in words of life return life to those who are dying ! Do not trust the silence and the darkness if they obstruct your way like a wall : Shout more loudly into the silence and the darkness , for there dwells unspeakable horror .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>That 's right , David , that 's right ! I see how your spirit climbs to the peak of the mountain and how you knock loudly at the iron gates of eternity : Open ! I love you , David , I kiss your hand , David ,— like a dog I am ready to crawl before you and to obey your commandments . Call , David , call ! Rise , O earth ! North and South , East and West , I command you , by the will of David , my master , answer the call of him who calls you , and stop at his feet like four oceans of tears . Call , David , call !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>David is calling you all . Confusion , tears , laughter ,— for all believe him now . Anathema kisses David 's hand , springing about delightedly . He drags the Organ-grinder by the collar to the center .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Look , David , here 's a musician ! Laughs and shakes the Organ-grinder . So you do n't want your old music , eh ? You need a new monkey , eh ? Perhaps you will ask for a powder that destroys the fleas ? Ask ; we shall give you everything .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Be quiet , Nullius , be quiet . We must work . You are an expert at counting , Nullius , are you not ?</p>

     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Be seated , then ; write and count . But there is one more thing , my dear children : I am an old Jew , who can divide a piece of garlic into ten portions . I know not only the need of man , but I saw also how a roach was starving — yes ,— I saw also how small children died of hunger .... Lowers his head and heaves a deep sigh . Therefore do not deceive me , and remember that there is a number and a measure for everything . And where ten copecks are needed , do not ask for twenty , and where one measure of grain is needed , do not ask for two , for what is superfluous for one is always essential to another . Like brothers having one mother whose breasts are full but are quickly exhausted , do not abuse one another , and do not offend the generous but careful mother .... You may begin . Nullius , is everything ready ?</p>
    </sp>

     <p>You may begin . I am waiting , David .</p>

     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Stand in line , then , I beg you . I have not received the money yet ; it is still in America , but I shall write down exactly how much each one of you is to get according to his need .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>David , David , what are you doing with us ? Look at Rosa , look at poor Naum . Naum is dumfounded — he wants to say something , but is unable ; he clutches the air with outstretched fingers . A little distance away from him , alone in her youth , strength , and beauty , amidst all these poor people , with emaciated faces and flat breasts , stands Rosa , who looks at her father defiantly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROSA</speaker>
     <p>Are we less your children than these who have been picked up in the street ? And are we not brother and sister to those who died ?</p>

     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Rosa is right , mother ,— everybody will get the proper share .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ROSA</speaker>
     <p>Yes ? But do you know , father , what is the proper share for everybody ? She laughs bitterly and wants to go away .</p>

     <stage>The same dust-covered road , with the bent posts and the old , deserted sentinel-box ; the same little shops . The sun is burning as mercilessly as when Anathema first appeared there .</stage>
     <stage>A large number of poor people are gathered there to welcome David Leizer , who had distributed his fortune among the poor . The air is rent by shouting , motion , and merry bustling . Purikes , Bezkrainy , and Sonka , happy now , and proud of their shops , are doing a brisk business in soda-water and candies . Sarah Leizer is sitting as before near her little shop , dressed neatly but poorly .</stage>
     <stage>A solemn welcome is arranged for David and Anathema , who had gone to the seashore . All the little shops , even the posts and the deserted sentinel-box , are decorated with parti-colored rags and with branches of trees ; on the right side of the road , upon the scorched grass , an orchestra is preparing to meet David — several Jews with various instruments , among which there are : a good violin , cymbals , a broken brass trumpet , and even a drum , slightly broken . The members of the orchestra are scolding one another criticizing each other 's instruments .</stage>
     <stage>There are a number of children in the crowd . Also , little babes in arms . Abraham Khessin and those who were in line when David started to distribute his money are there ; a little distance away from the crowd stands the stern organ-grinder , with his organ .</stage>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KHESSIN</speaker>
     <p>No , Leibke , I have n't seen such a big hole , but that is not at all important . David Leizer was a multimillionaire , he had twenty million roubles , but he is unspoiled and humble , and your love will afford him joy . Does the soul need a drum to be able to express its love ? I see here people who have neither drums nor trumpets , and who weep for happiness — their tears are noiseless like the dew .— Rise higher , Leibke , rise a little higher to the sky , and you will not hear any drums there , but therefore you will hear the tears falling .</p>

     <speaker>OLD MAN</speaker>
     <p>You must n't quarrel and darken the days of bright happiness ,— that would be disagreeable to David . A Wanderer is listening to their conversation ; his face is stern and swarthy . His hair and his clothes are covered with dust . He is guarded in his movements , but his eyes , lustreless , stare ahead fixedly , like open windows at night .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WANDERER</speaker>
     <p>He has brought peace and happiness on earth , and the whole world knows of him already . I have come from distant places , where the people are different from you , and where the customs are different from yours , and only in their suffering and their misery they are your brethren . And there they know already about David Leizer , who distributes bread and happiness , and they bless his name .</p>

     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>I hear , Abraham , I hear everything . But I hear no longer the voice of Naum who died ; I hear no longer the voice of Rosa . Old man , you have wandered much over the world , and you know even the people that do not resemble us ,— have you not met on the road a beautiful girl , the most beautiful of all girls on earth ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BEZKRAINY</speaker>
     <p>She had a daughter , Rosa , a beautiful girl , she ran away from home because she would not give up her share to the poor . Did she take much money along with her , Sarah ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Can there be such a thing as too much money for Rosa ? You may as well say that there are too many diamonds in the Czar 's crown and too many rays in the sun .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WANDERER</speaker>
     <p>No , I have not seen your daughter : I am traveling along the highways , and there you can see neither the rich nor the beautiful .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>But perhaps you have seen people gathered , talking enthusiastically about a certain beautiful girl ? That is my daughter , old man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WANDERER</speaker>
     <p>No , I have not seen such people . But I have seen other people gathered , speaking about David Leizer , who is distributing bread and happiness . Is it true that your David has healed a woman who was suffering from an incurable disease and was already dying ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KHESSIN</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Smiling .</l>
      <l>No , that is not true .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WANDERER</speaker>
     <p>Is it true that David restored sight to a man who was blind from the day of his birth ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KHESSIN</speaker>
     <p>Shaking his head . No , that is not true . Some one has been deceiving the people who do not resemble us . Only God can perform miracles — David Leizer is only a kind-hearted and worthy man , such as all men who have not forgotten God should be .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PURIKES</speaker>
     <p>It is not true , Abraham Khessin . David is not an ordinary man , and he possesses a superhuman power . I know it . The crowd that surrounded them is eagerly listening to Purikes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PURIKES</speaker>
     <p>I saw with my own eyes , how the one we regarded as a customer came upon the deserted , sunny road , but he was not a customer . I saw with my own eyes how he touched David with his hand , and David started to speak so terribly that I could not listen to him . Do you remember it , Ivan ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BEZKRAINY</speaker>
     <p>That 's true . David is not an ordinary man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SONKA</speaker>
     <p>Does an ordinary man throw money at people , like stones at a dog ? Does an ordinary man go to weep over the grave of another 's child , whom he did not bring forth , whom he did not fondle , and whom he did not bury when death came ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
     <p>With child in her arms . David is not an ordinary man . Who ever saw an ordinary man who was more a mother to a child than his own mother ? Who hides behind the bed-curtain and watches how other people 's children are eating , and who weeps for joy at the sight of them ? Of whom even the tiniest children are not afraid , and they play with his venerable beard as with the beard of their grandfather ? Did not the stupid little Rubin tear out a tuft of grey hair from David Leizer 's venerable beard ? Did David grow angry ? Did he cry out for pain , did he stamp his feet ? No , he began to laugh as if overcome with happiness , and he cried as though for joy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DRUNKARD</speaker>
     <p>David is not an ordinary man . He is a queer fellow . I said to him : “ Why do you give me money ? It is true , I am barefooted and unwashed , but do not think that I will buy boots and soap for the money you give me . I 'll spend it on drink in the nearest dram-shop . ” That 's what I had to tell him , for although I am a drunkard , I am an honest man . And the queer David answered me jestingly , like a good-natured lunatic : “ Semyon , if it pleases you to drink , please drink ,— I have not come to teach the people but to bring them joy . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLD JEW</speaker>
     <p>There are many teachers , but there is none to bring them joy . May God bless David who brings joy to mankind .</p>

     <p>No , I am an honest man .</p>

     <speaker>VIOLINIST</speaker>
     <p>In despair . Well , tell me all , you who have any conscience : Is this the kind of music that should greet him who brings joy to mankind ? I am ashamed that I have gotten together such a poor orchestra , and I would rather die than disgrace myself before David .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>To the organ-grinder . Will you also play ? You have such a fine organ now that even angels might dance to your music .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>ORGAN-GRINDER</speaker>
     <p>I will .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>But why have you no monkey ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ORGAN-GRINDER</speaker>
     <p>I could n't find a good monkey . All the monkeys I have seen are either old , or mean , or altogether untalented , and are even unable to catch fleas . The fleas have already destroyed one of my monkeys , and I do n't want another monkey destroyed that way . A monkey needs talent , just like a man ,— it is n't enough to have a tail , even to be a monkey . The wanderer is questioning Khessin in a low voice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WANDERER</speaker>
     <p>Tell me the truth , Jew : I was sent here by my people , and I walked many miles on my old legs , under the mercilessly scorching sun , for the purpose of learning the truth . Who is this David who brings joy to mankind . Let it be as you say that he does not heal the sick ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KHESSIN</speaker>
     <p>It is a sin and an offence against God to think that a human being can heal .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WANDERER</speaker>
     <p>Be it so . But is it not true that Leizer wants to build an enormous palace of white stone and blue glass and gather together all the poor of the world there ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KHESSIN</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>In embarrassment .</l>
      <l>I do not know . Is it possible to build such a large palace ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WANDERER</speaker>
     <p>With conviction . It is possible . Is it true that he wants to take away the power from the rich and bestow it upon the poor ?<stage>In a whisper .</stage>And to take the power from those who rule , the might from those who are in command , and distribute it among all the people on earth , giving an equal share to each of them ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KHESSIN</speaker>
     <p>I do not know</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Timidly</speaker>
     <p>You frighten me , old man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WANDERER</speaker>
     <p>Looking around cautiously . And is it true that he has already sent heralds to the black people that they , too , shall prepare themselves to accept the new kingdom , for he wants to bestow the power equally upon the black as upon the white , giving to each one according to his desire .<stage>In a mysterious whisper .</stage>In accordance with justice . On the road appears David Leizer , walking slowly ; in his right hand , a staff ; Anathema is holding his left arm reverently . There is agitation and confusion among the waiting crowd : the musicians rush for their instruments ; the women pick up their children quickly . They shout : “ He 's coming ! He 's coming ! ” They call : “ Moishe , Petya , Sarah ! ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WANDERER</speaker>
     <p>And is it true ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KHESSIN</speaker>
     <p>Ask him . Here he is coming . Noticing the crowd , Anathema stops David , who is absorbed in thought , and he points triumphantly to the people . Thus they stand for some time : David with his grey head thrown back , and Anathema clinging close to him . Anathema whispers something in David 's ear and keeps on pointing with his left hand . Leibke , bustling about desperately , gets his orchestra together and they begin to play a lively wild tune which is as discordant as the fluttering parti-colored rags . Shouting , laughter , the children are rushing forward , some one is crying ; many people are outstretching their hands prayerfully to David . Then David moves forward amidst this chaos of lively sounds . The crowd makes room for him to pass ; many throw branches and twigs on the ground and spread their clothes before him ; women tear of their head-dress and throw it at his feet on the dusty road . Thus he walks over to Sarah , who rises and welcomes him together with the other women . The music stops . But David is silent . Confusion .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KHESSIN</speaker>
     <p>Why are you silent , David ? The people you have made happy are greeting you and spreading their clothing before you on the ground , for their love is great and their hearts cannot comprise all their joy . Say a word to them — they are waiting . David remains standing , with lowered eyes ; with both hands he is leaning on his staff ; his face is stern and serious . Anathema looks at him , over his shoulder , with alarm .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>They are waiting for you , David . Say unto them a word of joy and calm their love . David is silent .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
     <p>Why are you silent , David ? You frighten us . Are you not the David who brings joy to mankind ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Impatiently . Speak , David . Their agitated ears are waiting for a word of joy and by your silence , which is like the dumbness of the rock , you crush their soul to the earth . Speak !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Lifting his eyes and surveying the crowd sternly . Wherefore these honors and the noise of voices , and the music which plays so loudly ? To whom do you render honors worthy of a prince or of one who has performed a great deed ? Is it before me , before a poor old man who must die soon , that you spread out your clothes upon the ground ? What have I done to deserve your delight and exultation , to force tears of senseless joy from your eyes ? I gave you money and bread — but that was the money of the Uppermost , it came from Him and went back to Him through you . The only thing I have done was not to hide the money like a thief , I did not become a plunderer , like those who have forgotten God . Do I speak properly , Nullius ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>No , David , no . Your speech is not worthy of a wise man and it does not come forth from the lips of a humble man .</p>

     <p>Oh , my little birds who died on the naked branches of the winter !... Oh , children , my children , little children , tiny children !... Well , Nullius , am I not weeping ? Am I not weeping , Nullius ? Well , let everybody weep . Let the musicians play , Nullius — I understand everything now . Oh , children , little children , I gave you all , I gave you my old heart , I gave you my sorrow and my joy — Did I not give them all my soul , Nullius ? Crying and laughing through tears . You have again wrenched my soul from the jaws of sin , Nullius . On the day of rejoicing I appeared mournful before the people , on the day of the people 's exultation I did not raise my eyes to Heaven , but lowered them to the ground ,— bad old man that I am . Whom did I want to deceive with my insincerity ? Do I not live by day and night in raptures of joy , and do I not draw love and happiness with full hands ? Why have I feigned sadness ?... I do not know your name , woman ; give me your child , the one that is laughing when everybody is crying , because he alone is sensible . Smiling through tears . Or are you perhaps afraid that I will steal it like a gypsy ? The woman kneels and holds out her child .</p>

     <p>Joy restores health , Abraham , and the serving of God strengthens a man . But after all , Sarah and I cannot live much longer , and we should like to rest our eyes upon the wonderful beauty of God 's land . But why do you address me as a stranger , old friend ? Have you not yet forgiven me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KHESSIN</speaker>
     <p>Frightened . Oh , do not say that , David ! If you were to tell me : Call me “ thou ” or kill yourself , I would rather kill myself , but would not say “ thou ” to you . You are not an ordinary man , David .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>I am not an ordinary man . I am a happy man . But where is the gay man Nullius ? I do n't see him . I suppose he is preparing some prank or another — I know him . There is a man who does not darken the face of the earth with gloom , Abraham , who is never averse to laughter , which is to life like dew upon grass , and which sparkles in many colors in the rays of the sun . Of course he is playing his pranks ; do you hear ? Music is playing beyond the pillars ; the organ , together with the orchestra , is playing the same tune it had played before . The sounds are discordant , somewhat wild , but strangely gay . Together with the music the crowd appears in a solemn procession . At the head of the procession , side by side with the Organ-grinder , walks Anathema , as if dancing . He carries the organ on a strap and turns the handle with one hand , keeping time with the other hand , whistling shrilly , and casting glances on all sides and skyward . The musicians and the poor , now gay , follow him . On passing David , Anathema bends his head toward him and keeps on playing and whistling . David , smiling , nods his head and adjusts his grey , long beard . The procession disappears .</p>

     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Do not make light of this , David . You are not an ordinary man . The Wanderer , who stood near by all the time and saw the solemn procession , now listens to Sarah 's words and nods his head . Anathema , gay , somewhat out of breath , appears .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>How was it , David ? I think it was not bad . They marched very well — better than I expected . Only that stupid trumpet . Dancing , he passes David again , whistling . Then he bursts into laughter .</p>

     <p>Good-naturedly . Yes , Nullius . The music was very good . I never before heard such fine music . I thank you , Nullius ,— you have afforded great pleasure to the people by your gayety .</p>

      <l>To the Wanderer .</l>
      <l>Did you like it , old man ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WANDERER</speaker>
     <p>I liked it fairly well . But what will happen when all the nations on earth will bend at the feet of David Leizer ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Astonished .</l>
      <l>What is he saying , Nullius ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Oh , David , it is very touching : the people are in love with you , even as a bride is in love with the bridegroom . This wonderful man , who has come thousands of miles —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WANDERER</speaker>
     <p>More .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Asked me : “ Does David Leizer perform miracles ? ” Well ,... I laughed , I laughed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>KHESSIN</speaker>
     <p>He asked me , too , but to me it was not laughable . The ear of him who waits is keen ,— even the stones seem to sing to him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WANDERER</speaker>
     <p>Only the footsteps of the blind are short , but their thoughts are long . He steps aside and , watches David . It is near sunset and the earth is in the embrace of shadows . Abraham Khessin bids David farewell and goes away . The shopkeepers prepare to close their shops . Silence and peace .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Breathing with difficulty . At last . We have worked quite hard , David — the trumpet alone<stage>closes his ears</stage>— what is that worth ?<stage>Candidly</stage>My misfortune is that my ear is keen , unbearably sharp , almost — yes , almost like that of a dog . If I hear —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>I am very tired , Nullius , and I want to rest . I do not feel like seeing any more people to-day , and you will not be offended , my old friend —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>I understand . I will only escort you to your palace .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes , to my palace . According to my contract , I am king for six months more . Come , Sarah ,— with you alone I want to pass the remainder of this great day in peace and joy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>You are not an ordinary man , David . How did you guess my desire ? They go away towards the pillars . David pauses , looks back , and says , leaning upon Sarah 's shoulder :</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Look , Sarah ; this is the place where our life has passed — how sad and poor it is , Sarah , and it breathes of the homelessness of the desert . But was not it here , Sarah , that I learned the great truth concerning the fate of man ? I was poor , alone , and near death , a foolish old man , seeking an answer from the waves . But now people have come — Am I alone now ? Am I poor and near death ? Listen to me , Nullius ; there is no death for man . What death is there ? What is death ? Who was the mournful one that invented this strange word — Death ?— Perhaps it does exist , I do not know — but I , Nullius — I am immortal . As though struck , he lends down , but lifts his arms upward . Oh , how terrible it is : I am immortal ! Where is the end of the sky ? I have lost it . I am immortal ! Oh , the breast of man aches from immortality , and his joy bums him like a fire . Where is the end of man ?— I am immortal . Adenoi ! Adenoi ! Blessed be the mysterious name of Him who has given immortality to man , forever and aye .</p>

     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Not listening to him . I give the spirit of man over to the boundless space of Time . May it five immortally , in the immortality of fire . May it live immortally in the immortality of light , which is life . And may darkness stop before the dwelling of immortal light . I am happy , I am immortal — O my God !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Ecstatically . It is a lie ! Oh , how long yet will I listen to this foolish man ? North and South , East and West , I am calling you . Quicker , come here , to the aid of the Devil ! Rush over here in four oceans of tears and bury man in your abyss . Come here ! This way ! No one heeds Anathema 's sobs , neither David , radiant with the ecstasy of immortality , nor Sarah , nor the other people , who listen attentively to David . Anathema moves restlessly about , alone , cursing . A shrill voice is heard ; a woman , terribly painted , rushes in from the road . Her clothes are torn , and her beautiful face is disfigured . She screams and sobs and calls wildly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
     <p>My God ! Where is David , who is distributing his fortune ? Two days and two nights , two days and two nights , I have been looking for him all over the city , but the houses are silent and the people are laughing . Tell me , kind people , have you not seen David , who brings joy to the people ? Do not look upon my open bosom — a wicked man tore my clothes and scratched my face . Oh , do not look upon my open bosom : it never knew the happiness of feeding innocent lips .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WANDERER</speaker>
     <p>David is here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
     <p>Falling on her knees . David is here ? Oh , have pity on me , people ! do not deceive me ; I am blinded by deceit , and falsehoods have made me deaf . Do I hear right ? Is David here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BEZKRAINY</speaker>
     <p>Yes , there he stands . But you are too late — he has already distributed all his fortune .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PURINES</speaker>
     <p>He has already distributed all his fortune . WOMAN . What are you doing to me , people ? Two days and two nights I have been looking for him — the people deceived me , and now I am too late . I will die on the way now — I have nowhere else to go . Tearfully , flings herself about on the dust-covered road .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>It seems that somebody has come to you , David .</p>

     <p>Yes , it is I .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
     <p>Without lifting her head . I do not dare glance at you . You must be like the sun . Gently and trustfully . Oh , David , how long I have been looking for you !... The people kept deceiving me all the time . They told me that you went away , that you do not exist at all , and that you never existed . One man said to me that he was David , and he seemed to be kind , but he treated me like a robber .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Rise !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
     <p>Permit me to rest here , at your feet . Like a bird that has crossed the sea , I am beaten by the rain , I am exhausted by the storms , I am tired to death . Weeps ; continues trustfully . Now I am calm , now I am happy : I am at the feet of David , who has brought joy to mankind .</p>

     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>

      <l>Irresolutely .</l>
      <l>But you have come too late , woman . I have already given away everything</l>

     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Yes . We have distributed all the money . Go home , woman ,— we have nothing left . We feel sorry for you , but you are too late . Do you understand ? You are too late ,— only this morning we gave away the last penny .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Do n't be so cruel , Nullius .</p>

     <p>But it is the truth , David .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
     <p>Doubtingly . That is impossible ! Lifting her eyes . Are you David ? How kind-hearted you are . Did you say that I am too late ? No , he said it — his face is mean . David , please give me some money and save me . I am tired to death . And your name is Sarah ? You are his wife ? I have heard about you , too . Crawls over to her and kisses her dress .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
     <p>Plead for me , Sarah .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Weeping . Give her some money , David . Get up , my dear ; it is very dusty here — you have such beautiful black hair . Sit down here , and rest yourself . David will soon give you money . Lifts the woman and seats her near herself upon a rock , and caresses her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>What shall I do ?</l>
      <l>Confusedly ; wiping his face with a red kerchief .</l>
      <l>What shall I do , Nullius ? You are such a wise man ,— help me .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Outstretching his arms . By God , I do not know . Here is the list — we have not a cent , and I am an honest lawyer , not a counterfeiter . I can n't bring you every day an inheritance from America .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Whistles</speaker>
     <p>I have nothing to do , so I roam about the world .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Indignantly . That is cruel , Nullius . I did not expect it from you . But what shall I do ? what shall I do ? Anathema shrugs his shoulders .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Sit here , my dear ; I will come back soon . David , let us step aside ; I must tell you something . They step aside and whisper .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Did they beat you hard , woman ? Evidently the man who was beating you was not skillful — he did not knock your eyes out , as he wanted to do .</p>

     <p>Three hundred roubles .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Give it to the woman . Smiling and crying . Sarah does not want to go to Jerusalem . She wants to continue in business here until death comes . What a foolish woman , Nullius , is n't she ? Cries restrainedly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Does that cause you much pain , David ? Were you so eager to go ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>What a foolish woman , Nullius . She does not understand that I also want to remain in business here .</p>

     <p>You are not an ordinary man , David .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>It was my dream , Nullius , to die in the Holy City and to join my dust to the dust of the righteous people buried there . But<stage>he smiles</stage>is not the ground everywhere kind to its dead ? Give the money to the poor woman . Well , Sarah , how shall it be ? We must open a store and learn from Sonka how to make good soda-water .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Triumphantly . Woman , David , who has brought joy to mankind , gives you money and happiness .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>BEZKRAINY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>To Sonka .</l>
      <l>I told you that he has not distributed all his money . He has millions .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WANDERER</speaker>
     <p>Listening . That 's right . How could David give away everything ? He only started to give away . The woman thanks David and Sarah ; he places his hands upon her head , as though blessing her . Behind him , from the side of the field , something grey appears , dust-covered , moving slowly . They move silently , and it is hard to discern at first that they are human beings . The grey dust has equalized them — their distress and their suffering have made them brethren . There is something alarming in their dull , inflexible movement — and the people look upon them uneasily .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BEZKRAINY</speaker>
     <p>Who is coming there on the road ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SONKA</speaker>
     <p>Something grey is crawling along the road . If they are human beings , they do not look like human beings .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PURIKES</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I am afraid for David . He stands with his back toward them , and does not see them . And they are coming like blind people .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SONKA</speaker>
     <p>They will soon crush him . David , David , turn around and look .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>It is too late , Sonka ,— David can n't hear you now .</p>

     <speaker>PURIKES</speaker>
     <p>But who is that ? I am afraid of them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WANDERER</speaker>
     <p>These are our people ! These are blind people from our land ,— they have come to David for their eyesight .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Loudly</speaker>
     <p>Stop , stop ! you have reached your destination . David is in your midst . The blind , almost crushing the frightened David , pause and seek him with their fingers .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE BLIND</speaker>
     <p>Where is David ? Help us to find David . Where is David , who brings joy to mankind ? He is here . I feel him already with my fingers . Are you David ? Where is David ? Where is David ? Are you David ?</p>

    <head type="act">ACT FOUR</head>
    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>A large , high , somewhat dark room — David 's study in the rich villa where he spends his last days . Two large windows in the room : one overlooking the road to the city ; the other , on the left , overlooking the garden . Near this window , a large writing-table , covered with papers in disorder — sheets of paper of various sizes , and large books . Under the table , and near it , paper torn into small bits . A large Bible , bound in old leather , lies on the floor , open , with its back upward , resembling the roof of a house which is falling apart . Notwithstanding the heal , there is a fire in the fireplace . David Leizer feels cold and feverish .</stage>
     <stage>It is growing dark . Through the lowered blinds , faint sunlight comes in , but it is already dark in the room . Only the small lamp on the table brings out into bold relief the white heads of David and Anathema .</stage>
     <stage>David is sitting by the table . His hair and beard , unkempt for some time , lend him a savage and terrible appearance ; his face is emaciated , his eyes are wide open ; clasping his head with both hands , he stares fixedly through his large spectacles , examines a paper , throws it aside , takes up another paper , and nervously turns the leaves of a heavy volume .</stage>
     <stage>Anathema stands near him , holding the back of his arm-chair . He is motionless , thoughtful , and stern .</stage>
     <stage>The windows are closed , but through the dosed windows comes the muffled noise of many voices . It increases slowly , wavering in force and impassionateness . Those who had been called by David are now besieging his house . Silence .</stage>
    </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>It has crumbled away into dust ; Nullius ! The mountain that reached the sky has split into rocks , the rocks have turned into dust , and the wind has carried the dust away . Where is the mountain , Nullius ? Where are the millions which you brought me ? Here I have been looking for an hour through my papers for one copeck , only one copeck , that I may give it to him who asks for it , but I cannot find it . What is lying around there ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>The Bible .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>No , no , I mean there , among the papers . Let me have it . I think it is an account I have n't examined yet . That would be good luck , Nullius ! Stares intently . No , it is all crossed out here . Look , Nullius , look ! A hundred , then fifty , then twenty ,— and then one copeck . But I cannot take this copeck away from him , can I ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Six , eight , twenty ,— correct .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>No , no , Nullius ,— one hundred , fifty — twenty ,— one copeck . It has all melted away , it slipped through my fingers like water . And the fingers are dry already — and I feel cold , Nullius !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>It is warm here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>I say it is cold here , Nullius . Throw some logs of wood into the fireplace .... No , wait . How much does a log cost ? Oh , it costs a great deal ; put it away , Nullius ,— this accursed fire is devouring wood so quickly , as though it did not know that every log of wood is — a life . Wait , Nullius .... You have a splendid memory , you never forget anything , like a book — do n't you remember how much I designated for Abraham Khessin ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>At first , five hundred .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes , Nullius , of course ,— he is an old friend of mine ; we used to play together . And for a friend five hundred is not much at all . Of course , he is an old friend of mine , and I must have pitied him and left to him more than to the others in the end — for our friendship is such a tender feeling , Nullius . But it is bad if a man wrongs strangers and distant people on account of a friend — for they have no friends or protection . And we will cut down Abraham Khessin 's allowance , we will cut it down just a little bit ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>With fear</speaker>
     <p>Tell me , how much have I now allowed for Abraham ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>One copeck .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Impossible ! Tell me that you have made an error ! Have pity on me , and tell me that you have made an error , Nullius ! It cannot be — Abraham is my friend — we used to play together . Do you understand what it means when children play together , and then they grow up and they have grey beards , and they smile together at the past ? You have also a grey beard , Nullius .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Yes , my beard is grey . You allowed one copeck for Khessin .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Takes Anathema by the arm ; in a whisper . But she said that her child would die , Nullius ,— that he is dying already . Understand me , my old friend , I must have money . You are such a fine man , you are<stage>pats his arm</stage>such a kind man , you remember everything , like a book ,— search a little more .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Bethink yourself , David ; your reason is betraying you . It is already two days that you have been sitting here at this table , looking for that which is no more . Go out to the people who are waiting for you , tell them that you have nothing left , and dismiss them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Angrily</speaker>
     <p>DAVID . But did I not go out ten times already to the people and did I not tell them that I have nothing left ? Did a single one of them go away ? They stand and wait there , and they are firm in their misery , like a rock , obstinate like the child at the mother 's breast . Does a child ask whether there is milk in the mother 's breast ? When I speak , they are silent and they listen to me like reasonable people ; but when I become silent , the spirit of despair and want seizes upon them and wails in a thousand voices . Did I not give everything away to them , Nullius ? Did I not cry out all my tears ? Did I not give them away all the blood of my heart ? What are they waiting for , Nullius ? What do they want of the poor Jew , who has already exhausted his life ?...</p>

     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>They are waiting for a miracle , David .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Rising , with fear . Be silent , Nullius , be silent ,— you are tempting God . Who am I that I should perform miracles ? Bethink yourself , Nullius . Can I make two copecks of one ? Can I come over to the mountains and say : “ Mountains of the earth , turn into mountains of bread and satisfy the hunger of the hungry ” ? Can I come over to the ocean and say : “ Sea of water as salty as tears , turn into a sea of milk and honey and quench the thirst of the thirsty ” ? Think of it , Nullius !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Did you see the blind ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Only once did I dare lift my eyes ,— but I saw strange , grey people , into whose eyes some one had spat something white , and they feel the air as if it were a danger , and they fear the earth as though it were a horror . What do they want , Nullius ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Did you see the sick and the maimed , with organs of the body missing ,— did you see them crawl on the ground ? Out of the pores of the earth they come like a perspiration of blood — the earth is of them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Be silent , Nullius .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Did you see people who are devoured by their conscience : their face is dark , as though scorched by fire , and their eyes are surrounded with white rings , and they run about in a circle like mad horses ? Did you see people who look straight ahead , and in their hands they hold long staffs for measuring the road ? These are the people searching after truth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>I dared not look any further .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Did you hear the voice of the earth , David ?</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Enter Sarah ; she advances to David timidly .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Is that you , Sarah ? Shut the door tightly , do not leave a crevice behind you . What is it you wish , Sarah ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>With fear and faith . Are you not entirely prepared yet , David ? Make haste and go out to the people : they are tired of waiting and many of them fear death . Dismiss these , for others are coming , David , and soon there will be no place for a man to stand . The water has already given out in the fountains and they are not bringing any bread from the city , as you have ordered , David .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Uplifting his hands ; horrified . Awaken , Sarah , sleep has enmeshed you in nets of cunning and your heart is poisoned with the madness of love . It is I , David !...</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>With fear</speaker>
     <p>And I did not command to bring bread .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>If you are not quite ready , David , they can wait . But order lamps lighted and give bedding for the women and the children ,— for night will soon set in and the earth will grow cold . And order them to give milk to the children — they are starved . There , in the distance , we have heard the sound of innumerable footsteps : are those not herds of cows and goats , full of milk , driven here at your command ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Hoarsely .</l>
      <l>Oh , my God , my God !...</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>In a low voice , to Sarah .</l>
      <l>Go away , Sarah : David is praying . Do not disturb his prayer .</l>
      <l>Sarah goes away timidly and cautiously .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Mercy ! Mercy ! The noise outside the windows subsides . Suddenly it is heard again : Sarah had notified them that they must wait .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Mercy ! Mercy !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>In a commanding tone . David be a man in the face of the great fear . Did you not call them here ? Did you not call loudly , in a voice of love , to the silence and the darkness where unspeakable horror dwells ? And now they have come to you — North and South , East and West , and like four oceans of tears they have stretched themselves at your feet . Rise , David !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>What shall I do , Nullius ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Tell them the truth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>What shall I do , Nullius ? Shall I perhaps take a rope and , hanging it upon a tree , strangle myself like the one who had once betrayed ? Am I , perhaps , a traitor , having called them and not given anything to them , and loving them in order to destroy them ? Oh , how my heart is aching !... Oh , how my heart is aching , Nullius ! Oh , I feel as cold as the ground that is covered with ice , and within it there is heat and white flame . Oh , Nullius , have you seen the white flame on which the moon turns dark and the sun burns like yellow straw ? He tosses about . Hide me , Nullius . Is there not a dark room , where the light does not penetrate ? are there not strong walls through which I would not hear these voices ? Whither are they calling me ? I am a sick old man , I cannot endure and suffer so long — I myself had small children , and did they not die ? What were their names , Nullius ? I have forgotten . Who is it they call David , the man who has brought joy to mankind ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>That was your name , David Leizer . You are deceived , Leizer . You are deceived even as I am deceived !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>With entreaty . Protect me , Nullius . Go out to them and tell them aloud , so they all can hear : “ David Leizer is a sick old man , and he has nothing left . ” They will listen to you , Nullius ,— you have such a respectful appearance ,— and they will return to their homes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes , David . You see the truth already , and you will soon proclaim it to the people . Ha , ha ! Who said that David Leizer could perform miracles ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Folding his arms .</l>
      <l>Yes , yes , Nullius .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Who dares demand miracles of Leizer ? Is he not a sick old man ,— mortal like all the rest ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes , Nullius ,— a man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Did not love deceive Leizer ? It said to him : “ I shall do everything , ” — and it raised only dust on the road like the blind wind from behind a corner , which bursts in noisily and lies down quietly , which blinds the eyes and stirs up the dust . Let us go , then , to Him who gave love to David , and ask Him : “ Wherefore did you deceive our brother David ? ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes , Nullius ! Of what good is love to man if it is powerless ? Of what good is life if there is no immortality ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Rapidly . Go out and tell this to them ,— they will listen to you . They will lift their voice to Heaven — and we shall hear the answer of Heaven , David ! Tell them the truth and you will stir up the earth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>I am going , Nullius . And I will tell them the truth — I have never lied . Open the doors , Nullius . Anathema quickly throws the door open and respectfully allows David to pass to the balcony . David walks slowly , with an air of importance . Then Anathema closes the door behind David . The noise suddenly subsides , a deathlike silence sets in , and David 's quivering voice is heard faintly . Anathema dances about the room in a fit of ecstasy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Ah ! you would not listen to me ,— now listen to them . Ah ! you forced me to crawl on my belly like a dog . You would not permit me to glimpse even through a crevice !... You laughed at me in your silence !... You tortured me by your motionlessness . Listen , then , and answer , if you can . It is not the Devil who speaks to you , it is not the son of Dawn who raises his voice ,— it is man , it is your favorite son , your care , your love , your tenderness , and your proud hope , that is wriggling under your foot like a worm . Well ? You are silent ? Lie to him by your thunder , deceive him with your lightning ,— how dares he look into the heavens ? Let him , like Anathema ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Wailing</speaker>
     <p>The poor , offended Anathema , who is crawling on his belly like a dog ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Furiously</speaker>
     <p>Let man crawl back again to his dark hole , let him decay in silence , bury himself in gloom , where unspeakable horror dwells . A myriad-voiced sound is heard from outside the windows .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Do you hear ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Sarcastically</speaker>
     <p>It is not I . It is they . Six , eight , twenty-correct . It is always correct with the Devil .... The door opens and David , horror-stricken , runs in . A shout is heard behind him . David closes the door and holds it with his shoulder .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Help , Nullius ! They will soon break in — the door is not strong ; they will break it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>What do they say ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>They do not believe me , Nullius . They ask for a miracle . But do the dead also shout ?— I saw the dead they have brought here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Furiously . Then lie to them , Jew ! David goes away from , the door and says mysteriously , with confusion and fear :</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Do you know , Nullius , something is going on within me ,— I have nothing ,— but here I went out to them , I saw them and suddenly I felt that it is not true — I do have something . And I spoke , but I did not believe it myself ; I spoke , and yet I felt that I stood with them and shouted against myself , and demanded angrily .... With my lips I declare that I have nothing ,' and with my heart I promise them , and with my eyes I cry out , Yes , yes , yes ! What shall I do , Nullius ? Tell me , are you sure that I have nothing ? Anathema smiles . Sarah 's , voice is heard behind the door on the right ; a knock at the door .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Let me in , David .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Do not open the door , Nullius .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>It is your wife , Sarah . He opens the door . Sarah enters , leading by the hand a pale-faced woman who is carrying something in her arms .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Meekly . Forgive me , David . But this woman says that she cannot wait any more . She says that if you delay any longer , she will not recognize her child when he is revived . If it is necessary for you to know his name , it is Moishe , little Moishe . He is a dark little one ,— I looked at him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
     <p>Falling down on her knees . Forgive me , David , for breaking the line and not waiting for my turn . But there are those who died but a little while ago , while I am carrying him already three days and three nights on my breast . Perhaps it is necessary for you to take a look at him ? Then I will uncover him — I am not deceiving you , David .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>I have looked at him already , David . She let me hold him awhile . She is very tired , David . David retreats slowly , the palms of his hands outstretched forward . He moves thus until he reaches the wall .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Mercy ! Mercy ! Both women wait patiently .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>What shall I do ? I am fainting , O God ! Nullius , tell them that I do not resurrect the dead !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
     <p>I implore you , David ! Do I ask you to restore life to an old man who has lived long and who has deserved death for his evil deeds ? Do I not understand whom it is possible to resurrect and whom it is not possible to resurrect ? But perhaps it is hard for you because he is dead so long . I did not know this ,— forgive me . And when he was dying , I promised him : “ Moishe , do not be afraid to die — David , who brings joy to mankind , will restore your little life to you . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Show him to me . Looks at him , shaking his head , and weeps , wiping his eyes with his red kerchief . Sarah looks at him confidently , leaning on his shoulder .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>How old was he ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
     <p>Two years , going on the third . David turns his tear-stained face to Anathema and says in a strange voice :</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Shall I make an attempt , perhaps , Nullius ? Suddenly he bends down and cries hoarsely : Adenoi !... Adenoi !... Begone ! Begone ! The Devil has sent you here . Tell them , Nullius , that I do not resurrect the dead . They have come to mock me ! Look , they are both laughing there . Begone ! Begone !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>In a low voice , to Sarah .</l>
      <l>Go away , Sarah , and lead the woman away . David is not quite ready yet .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>In a whisper . I will take her to my room . Later you may tell David that she is there . To the woman . Come , woman ,— David is not quite ready yet . They go out . David , exhausted , sits down in an arm-chair and lowers his grey head . He reads something softly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>They have gone , David . Do you hear ? They have gone away .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Nullius , did you see ? It was a dead child . Moishe .... Yes , yes , Moishe , a dark little one ; we looked at him ....<stage>Loudly , in despair .</stage>What shall I do ? Teach me , Nullius .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Quickly . Flee ! Listens to what is going on outside the window , nods his head affirmatively , and advances to David cautiously , like a conspirator ; David waits for him , with his arms folded as in prayer , a confident smile on his lips . His back is bent , and he frequently takes his red kerchief from his pocket , but does not know what to do with it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>In a whisper .</l>
      <l>We must flee , David , flee !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Joyously .</l>
      <l>Yes , yes , Nullius ,— we must flee .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>I shall hide you in a dark room which no one knows of ; when they fall asleep , tired of waiting and hungry , I shall lead you through the sleeping people — and will save you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Joyously .</l>
      <l>Yes , yes , save me .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>And they will be waiting ! In their sleep they will , wait and dream dreams of great expectations — and you will not be here any longer !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Nodding his head joyously . And I shall not be here any longer , Nullius ! And I shall have fled already , Nullius !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Laughs</speaker>
     <p>ANATHEMA .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Laughing</speaker>
     <p>And you will not be here any longer ! You will have fled ! Let them speak to Heaven then . They look at each other and laugh .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>In a friendly tone . Wait for me , David . I shall go out at once and see whether the house is still surrounded . They are such madmen !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes , look . They are such madmen ! Meanwhile I shall prepare myself , Nullius .... But I ask you , do not leave me here all alone for a long time . Anathema goes out . David goes cautiously on tiptoe to the window and wants to look out , but he dares not ; he goes to the table and is frightened by the scattered sheets of paper ; he moves cautiously to the corner where his clothes are . He dresses hastily , mixing up his clothes . For a long time he does not know what to do with his beard ; suddenly he pushes it under his coat and hides it with his collar .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Muttering . Yes , yes . I must hide my beard . All the children know my beard .... But why did they not tear it out ? Yes , yes , my beard .... But what a black coat ! It does not matter , you will hide it . That 's the way . Rosa had a mirror .... But Rosa ran away , and Naum also died , and Sarah — oh , but why does not Nullius come ? Does he not hear how they are shouting ?... A knock on the door .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Frightened .</l>
      <l>Who is there ? David Leizer is not here .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>It is I , David ; let me in . Anathema enters .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Well , Nullius ,— it is possible to recognize me now , is it not ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Very good , David . But I do n't know how we can get out . Sarah has filled the house with guests : in every room the blind and the maimed are waiting for you with a pleasant smile ; there are also dead people there , David . Your Sarah is a splendid woman , but she is too much of a hostess , David , and she intends to build up a fine household on miracles .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>But she must not do it , Nullius .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Many people are already sleeping at your doors , smiling in their dreams ,— self-confident , lucky people , who have managed to outstrip the others .... And in the garden and in the yard ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>With fear .</l>
      <l>What is there in the yard ?...</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Not so loud , David . Look and listen . He puts out the light in the room and draws aside the draperies ; the windows are lit up with a red light ; it is dark in the room , but David 's head , and the paper on the floor , are tinted a pale crimson hue .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Frightened , in a whisper .</l>
      <l>Where does this fire come from , Nullius ? I am afraid .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Also in a whisper . ‘ Tis a cold night , and they have started bonfires . Sarah told them that they would have to wait a long time yet , so they have taken precautions .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Where did they get the wood ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>They broke certain things . Sarah told them that you ordered them to start bonfires , and they are humbly burning whatever wood they find .... And there , David , farther away ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>In despair .</l>
      <l>What is it , Nullius ? What else can there be , there yonder ?...</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>I do not know , David . But from the upper window , which was wide open , I heard something like the roaring of the ocean when the rocks tremble with pain from the beating of the breakers ; it was as though the roaring of brass trumpets that I heard , David ,— they are shouting to the sky and to you , and they are calling you .... Do you hear ? In the muffled noise and chaos of sounds , ring out the sounds : Da-vid ! Da-vid ! Da-vid !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>I hear my name . Who is calling ? What do they want ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know . Perhaps they want to crown you as their king .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>You , David Leizer . Perhaps they are bringing you might and power — and the power of performing miracles — do you not want perhaps to become a God , David ? Look and listen . He throws the windows wide open . The sounds of the voices calling “ Da-vid , Da-vid , Da-vid ! ” grow louder and are mingled with the blowing of trumpets . David at first moves to the wall , then he slowly advances to the window . He straightens himself , looks out of the window , and pushing Anathema aside , outstretches his arms to the poor of the earth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Calling .</l>
      <l>Come this way ! Come here ! To me ! I am here ! I am with you !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Astonished .</l>
      <l>What ? You are calling them ? You — are — calling — them ? Bethink yourself ,</l>
      <l>Leizer !</l>
     </lg>

     <p>Angrily . Be silent ! you do not understand me ! We are all human beings and we shall go together . Enthusiastically . And we shall go together ! Come here , brethren , come ! Look , Nullius ,— they have lifted their heads , they are looking , they hear me . This way ! this way !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Will you perform miracles ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Angrily . Be silent — you are a stranger . You speak as an enemy of God and mankind . You know neither pity nor compassion . We are tired , we are exhausted ,— even the dead have grown tired of waiting . Come here — and we shall go together . This way !</p>
    </sp>

      <l>Looking at David .</l>
      <l>Are not the blind showing the way to them ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Who needs eyesight if not the blind ? This way , blind !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Are not the lame making the road and swallowing the dust there ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Who needs the road if not the lame ? This way , maimed !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Are they not carrying the dead on the stretchers , swaying with measured steps ? Look , David , and dare to say : “ Come this way , to me . I am he who resurrects the dead ! ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Tormented .</l>
      <l>You know no love , Nullius .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>“ I am he who restores sight to the blind ” — Loudly , through the window . This way ! Nations of the earth , seeking God ,— come together , at the feet of David — he is here !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Not so loud .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Eh , this way ! Suffering mothers ,— fathers who have lost their reason in grief ,— brothers and sisters who devour one another in the convulsions of hunger — come this way , to David , who has brought joy to mankind !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Seizing him by the shoulder . You have lost your mind , Nullius . They may hear you and may break into the house .... What are you doing , Nullius ? Be more cautious .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>

      <l>Shouting .</l>
      <l>David is calling you !</l>

     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>

      <l>Dragging him away from the window forcibly .</l>
      <l>Be silent ! I 'll choke you if you utter another word . You dog !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Releasing himself . You are as foolish as a human being . When I call you to flee from here , you curse me . When I call you to love — you want to choke me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>With contempt</speaker>
     <p>Man !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Enfeebled . Oh , do not ruin me , Nullius . Oh , forgive me if I have angered you , foolish old man that I am , with a memory that fails me . But I cannot — I cannot perform any miracles !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Let us flee from here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes , let us flee .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Irresolutely</speaker>
     <p>But where ? Where do you want to lead me , Nullius ? Is there a place on earth where God is not present ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>I shall lead you to God .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>No , I do n't want to go to Him . What will God tell me ? And what shall I answer Him ? Be considerate , Nullius . Can I say anything in answer to God now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>I shall lead you to the desert . We shall leave here these wicked and vicious people , who are seized with the itch of suffering and who break down posts and fences like hogs that scratch themselves .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Irresolutely .</l>
      <l>But they are human beings , Nullius .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Renounce them , and , pure , stand up in the desert before the face of God . Let the rock be your bed , let the howling jackal become your friend , let only the sky and the sand hear the penitent moans of David — not a single stain of another 's sin shall come upon the pure snow of his soul . He who remains with lepers becomes a leper himself — only in solitude will you see God . To the desert , David , to the desert !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>I shall pray .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>You will pray .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>I shall exhaust my body with fasting .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>You will exhaust your body with fasting .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>I shall cover my head with ashes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>What for ? Unfortunate people do that . But you will be happy , David , in your sinlessness . To the desert , David , to the desert !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>To the desert , Nullius , to the desert !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Quickly . Let us run . There is a cellar here of which no one knows . There are old barrels there , and there is the smell of wine . I shall hide you . And when they fall asleep —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>To the desert ! To the desert ! They rush out quickly . Disorder and silence in the room .. Through the open window soon comes in the noise of voices and of brass trumpets , moans and sobs of the mob ,— “ Da-a-a-vid ! ” And with its pages bent under it , like a house that is falling apart , lies the Bible , with its back upward .</p>

    <stage>SLOW CURTAIN .</stage>
   </div>
   <div type="act" n="5">
    <head type="act">ACT FIVE .</head>
    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>On the right , upon the slope of a mountain , a dilapidated stone fence . On the left , the sea is seen . Beyond the fence , a deserted garden ; among the trees two tall cypress trees stand out prominently . The sea is dark . It is before a storm . The sky is overcast with heavy clouds , which are driven rapidly by the wind .</stage>
     <stage>As the curtain goes up no one is on the stage ; then Anathema climbs over the fence and assists David over the fence . David is very weak and moves with difficulty . Their dark clothes are covered with mud and torn in places . Both have lost their hats on the way .</stage>
    </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Quicker , quicker , David ! They are pursuing us . In this dark garden , where it is so quiet , I heard a roaring in the distance , on that side ,— as though there were another sea there . Quicker , David !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>I can n't , Nullius . Put me down here that I may die .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Put your foot here , on this rock . Take care .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Before my eyes are paths which turn and turn and lead to the wall . Then there are more walls , Nullius , and this dark ditch where a bloated dead horse is lying . Where are we , Nullius ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>We are at the sea . We shall take a boat from the fishermen and trust ourselves to the waves — You will sooner find mercy with the senseless waves , David , than with the maddened people .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Yes , it is better to die . He lies down by the fence . I am fifty-eight years old , Nullius , and I must have a rest .... But who was the man that met us on the highway and was so greatly overjoyed , and ran off shouting : “ Here is David , who has brought joy to mankind ? How does he know me ? I had never seen him before .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>As if surveying the shore . Your fame is great , David .... Strange , I do not find any path leading downward .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Shutting his eyes . The cypress trees have turned dark — there will be a storm to-night , Nullius . We should have remained at the stone pit : it was dark and quiet there , and I slept like a man with clear conscience .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Grumbling</speaker>
     <p>But why are you silent , Nullius ? Or am I to speak all alone , as if I were already in the desert ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>NULLIUS</speaker>
     <p>I am searching .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>With dissatisfaction . What else is there to search for ? We have searched enough to-day , and we jumped like trained dogs . I felt ashamed , Nullius , when I climbed the fences like a little boy stealing apples . You had better come over here and tell me something about your wanderings . I am too tired to sleep .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>You 'll not be able to sleep , David .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Advancing</speaker>
     <p>There is no way down to the sea .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>What of it ? Look for it elsewhere .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Outstretching his hand in the direction of the city . Look , David ; what is that white line there in the distance ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Lifting his head .</l>
      <l>I do n't see it .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>It is the city which is awaiting you . Now listen . What is that noise in the distance ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Listening .</l>
      <l>That — of course , Nullius , that is the echo of the waves of the sea .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>No . It is the voice of the people , who will come here soon and will demand miracles from you , and will offer you the kingdom of the poor on earth . When we were hiding in the rocks , I heard two men speak as they hastened to the city : they said that you had been carried away by some evil one and that it was necessary to rescue you from that evil one and offer you the kingdom .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Am I not a sick old Jew ? Am I a piece of gold that I should be stolen ? Leave me alone , Nullius ; you are raving like the other people .... I am sleepy .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Impatiently .</l>
      <l>But they are coming this way .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Let them come . You will tell them that David is sleeping and that he does not want to perform miracles . He prepares himself for sleep .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Bethink yourself , David .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Stubbornly . He does not want to perform any miracles . Good night , Nullius . I am old and I do not like to talk nonsense .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>David ! David does not answer ; he falls asleep , his hands folded under his head .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Awaken , David ! the people have come here . Pushes him angrily . Get up , I say . You make believe that you are asleep — I do n't believe you . Do you hear ? Through his teeth . You 've fallen asleep — damned flesh ! Steps aside and listens .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Ha , ha ! They are coming .... They are coming .... And their king is sleeping ! They are coming — and their miracle-worker is sleeping the sleep of the horse which draws water . They are carrying a crown and death — and their victim and master is catching the wind with an open mouth , smacking his lips for pleasure . O miserable race ! There is treachery in your bones , betrayal in your blood , and falsehood in your heart ! It is better to rely upon flowing waters , to walk upon the waves as upon a bridge ; it is better to lean upon the air as upon a rock , than to trust one 's haughty anger and bitter dreams to a traitor . Goes over to David and pushes him rudely . Get up ! Get up , David ,— Sarah is here , Sarah , Sarah !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Awakening . Are you here , Sarah ? I 'll be up soon ; I am very tired , Sarah .... What is this ? You , Nullius ? Where is Sarah ? Did n't she call me just now ? How tired I am ! how tired I am , Nullius !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Sarah is coming . Sarah is carrying an infant .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>What infant ? We have no small children . Our children —</l>
      <l>Half rises , looks around , frightened .</l>
      <l>What is that , Nullius ? who is crying there ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Sarah is carrying a dead child . You must resurrect the dead child ,</l>
      <l>David . He is dark , and his name is Moishe — Moishe — Moishe !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Rising . We must flee , Nullius . We must flee . But where is the road ? Where have you led me to ? Seizes Anathema by the arm . Listen how they are shouting . They are coming this way , to me — oh , save me , Nullius !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>There is no way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Holding David</speaker>
     <p>There is an abyss .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>What shall I do , Nullius ? Shall I , mayhap , hurl myself down and dash my head against the rocks ? But am I a wicked wretch that I should come to God without His calling me ? Oh , if God only called me — faster than an arrow would my old soul rush to Him ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Listens</speaker>
     <p>They are shouting . They are calling ... calling ? Step aside , Nullius ; I want to pray .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Steps aside .</l>
      <l>But make haste , David ; they are near .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Do you hear ? They are coming . I love them , but my love is bitterer than hatred , and it is as powerless as indifference . Kill me , and meet them yourself . Kill me — and meet them with mercy , with love . Fertilize the hungry earth with my body and grow bread upon it , drown sorrow with my soul and grow laughter upon it . And joy , O Lord , joy for mankind .... The approach of an enormous mob is heard .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Advancing .</l>
      <l>Quicker , David , quicker ,— they are approaching .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>One moment , one moment .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>In despair</speaker>
     <p>Joy ... What else ? Only one word — only one word — but I have forgotten it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Weeping</speaker>
     <p>Oh , what a great number of words there are , but one is missing .... But , perhaps , you need no words at all ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Only one word is missing ? How strange ! It seems that they have found their word — do you hear them wailing ? “ Da-a-vid ! Da-a-vid ! ” Rise , David , and meet them proudly ; it seems they are beginning to mock you . David rises . Some one rushes in ahead of the mob , shouting joyously : “ David ! ” and runs back . The sea looks in one place as though stained with blood .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Retreating a step . I am afraid , Nullius . This is the same one we met on the road , with a red little beard .... I fear him , Nullius .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Meet them proudly . Strike them with the truth , David ,— with the truth !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>But do not leave me alone , Nullius , or I shall forget again where the truth is . People appear on the fence . They are exhausted , mud-covered , like David . They seem to be blind yet their faces are radiant with joy , and they keep exclaiming : “ Da-vid ! Da-vid ! ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Outstretching his arms . Back — They do not listen to him and keep climbing the fence , wailing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Audaciously .</l>
      <l>Where are you going ? Back — back , you were told .</l>
      <l>The people in the front rank pause in fear .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>VOICES</speaker>
     <p>Stop ! Stop ! Who 's that ? That 's David . No , that 's the robber . The one who has carried him off . The robber .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>A RESTLESS MAN</speaker>
     <p>Silence ! Silence ! David wishes to speak . Listen to David . They become silent ; but in the distance people are still shouting : “ Da-vid ! ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>What is it you want ? Yes , it is I , David Leizer , a Jew from the same city that you come from . Why do you pursue me like a thief and frighten me like a robber with your shouting ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Audaciously . What do you want ? Go away from here . My friend David Leizer does not want to see you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Yes . Let me die here , for death is already approaching my heart ; go home to your wives and your children . I cannot ease your sufferings in any way ,— go . Do I speak properly , Nullius ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Yes , David .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE RESTLESS MAN</speaker>
     <p>Our wives are here and our children are here . Here they stand , waiting for your word of kindness , David ,— you who have brought joy to mankind ! I have no strength left in me and I have nothing to say . Go .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WOMAN</speaker>
     <p>Move forward a little , Rubin , and bow to our master David . You probably remember him , David ? Bow to him once more , Rubin . The boy bows timidly and hides in the crowd again . Laughter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OLD MAN</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Smiling .</l>
      <l>He is afraid of you , David . Do n't be afraid , boy .</l>
      <l>Milled laughter . The Wanderer comes forward .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WANDERER</speaker>
     <p>You have called us , David , and we have come . We have long waited silently for your merciful call , and now your call has reached the remotest boundaries of the earth . The roads have become black with people ; the deserted roads have come to life and the narrow paths are filled with footsteps , and they will soon become highways — and even as the blood that is in the body all rushes to the heart , so all the poor on earth will come to you alone . Welcome to you , our master David — the people are bowing before you with their life and the earth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>

      <l>DAVID .</l>
      <l>With sudden hope .</l>
      <l>Tell me , Nullius , tell me : Is righteousness a miracle ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Bitterly . There are the blind — they are innocent . There are the dead — and they are also innocent . The earth is bowing before you with its graves , and it greets you with darkness . Perform a miracle .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>

     <p>Suspiciously and sternly . And the people do not want you to speak with him whose name we dare not utter . He is an enemy of mankind , and at night , when you were asleep , he carried you off to this mountain — but it did not occur to him to carry off the heart of the people ; and , beating unceasingly , this heart has brought us to you .</p>

     <speaker>SARAH</speaker>
     <p>Peace be with you , David . Forgive me for disturbing you , but the people have asked me to speak with you and to find out when you intend to return home to your palace . And they have also asked you to make haste , David , for many have died already of unbearable sufferings — and the dead have already grown tired of waiting . And many have already lost their reason from their unbearable sufferings , and they will soon commence to murder ; if you will not make haste , David , all the people will become enemies — and it will be hard for you to establish a kingdom upon the dead earth . Bitter wailings in the distance : “ Da-vid ! Da-vid ! Da-vid ! ”</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>DAVID</speaker>
     <p>Weeping . Oh , Sarah , Sarah ! What are you doing with me ? Consider , Sarah ,— consider you all . Have I not given everything away to you ? I have nothing left . Have pity on me even as I had pity on you ,— and kill my unnecessary body with stones . I love you — and words of anger are powerless upon my lips , and wrath upon loving lips does not frighten you — have pity on me . I have nothing more . I have a little blood in my veins , but would I not give away the last drop of it , if I could only quench your bitter thirst ? Like a sponge I would have squeezed my heart between the palms of my hands — and the cunning heart , so greedy for life , would not dare hide a single drop .... Be tears his clothes and scratches his chest with his nails . Here my blood is flowing — my blood is flowing ? has a single one of you smiled a smile of joy ? Here I am tearing the hair of my beard and I fling the grey locks — I fling them at your feet — has a single dead person risen ? Here I spit into your eyes — will one blind man regain his sight ? Here I bite the rocks — the rocks — like a mad beast — will one hungry person be satiated ? Here I hurl myself at you — Be makes several quick steps , and the crowd retreats in horror .</p>

     <speaker>RESTLESS MAN</speaker>
     <p>Listen what David , who has brought joy to mankind , has done to me . He promised me ten roubles , and then took it back and gave me one copeck , and I thought that the copeck was not really a copeck — I went to a store with it and demanded a great deal , but they laughed and chased me away as a thief . You are the thief . You are the robber ; you have left my children without milk . Here is your copeck . Throws the copeck at David 's feet . Many other people follow his example .</p>

     <speaker>ANGRY MAN</speaker>
     <p>Traitor ! He raised the dead out of their graves in order to make sport of them . Strike him with stones . Bends down to lift a stone . A strong wind rises ; in the distance thunder-peals resound . The mob is horror-stricken .</p>

     <p>Hastily . Curse them , David . They will soon put you to death . Quick ! David lifts his arms and sinks down , struck by a stone . Almost in silence , grumbling , they hurl stones upon his motionless body . Thunder-peals . Anathema is laughing . Suddenly a woman screams . Then another . All are shouting . The mob runs away . The last one lifts a stone to throw it on David 's head , but looks around and finding himself alone , lets the stone fall out of his hand and runs away with a wild outcry .</p>

     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>

     <p>Look ! Look how the herd you have cursed is fleeing . Ha , ha ! They are falling from the rocks . Ha , ha ! They are hurling themselves into the sea . Ha ! They are trampling children under their feet . Look , David ,— they are trampling upon children . You have done it . Great and mighty David Leizer ! Favorite son of God ! You have done it . Ha , ha , ha ! He whirls around , madly laughing . Ah , where shall I go with my joy ? Ah , where shall I go with my tidings ? the earth is too small for it ! East and West ! North and South ! Look and listen . David , who has brought joy to mankind , is put to death by mankind and by God . And upon his ill-smelling corpse I — Anathema — will put my foot .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>To heaven</speaker>

I shall lie down quietly on the threshold , I shall only look through the crevice and see how the little children are eating .... Oh , my beard .... Oh , my terrible beard .... Oh , do n't be afraid , my little one ,— you alone are laughing . My little children , my tiny little children ....</p>

     <p>I told you , Nullius , to examine that paper . Abraham Khessin , my friend —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Firmly</speaker>
     <p>Abraham Khessin is my friend .... He sinks down and dies . Thunder in the distance . It is dark ; the sun , red , is seen on the horizon , near the water . It sets .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Bending over him . Is it true this time ? Are you dead ? Or do you He again ? No — it is an honest death now . Let me have your fist . Open it . You do n't want to ? But I am stronger than you . Rises and examines what David had in his hand . A copeck ! Throws it down with contempt . Pushes David with his foot . Farewell , fool . To-morrow people will find your body here and will bury you with pomp , according to the custom of the people . Kind-hearted murderers , they love those they kill . And out of the rocks with which they stoned you for your love , they will erect a tall , crooked , and stupid tombstone . And in order to enliven the stupid , dead pile of stone , they will put me on the top . He laughs . Then he suddenly breaks of his laughter and assumes a haughty pose . Who shall wrench the victory from the hands of Anathema ? The strong I kill , the weak I force to whirl about in an intoxicating dance — a mad dance — a devilish dance . He strikes the ground with his foot . Be subdued , O earth , and bring me your gifts humbly ! Kill , burn , betray , O man , in the name of your master ! I steer my boat over a sea of blood which smells so sweetly ,— and my sails are burning red —</p>

    <stage>CURTAIN .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EPILOGUE</speaker>
     <p>Nothing has happened ; nothing has changed . As before , the earth is weighted down by the heavy iron Gates , closed from time immemorial , beyond which dwells in silence and in mystery the Beginning of every being , the Supreme Wisdom of the universe . And the Guardian of the Entrances is just as silent and as sternly motionless as before . Nothing has happened ; nothing has changed . The grey light , as grey as the rocks , is terrible ; the place is terrible , but Anathema likes it . And he appears again ; but he does not crawl on his belly like a dog ; nor does he hide himself beyond the rocks like a thief . Like a conqueror , he is trying to seal his victory by his haughty gait , by the importance of his slow movements . But as the Devil can never be truthful , and as there are no bounds to his doubts , he brings his duality even into this : He walks like a conqueror , yet he is afraid ; he throws his head back high like a sovereign , and yet he laughs at his exaggerated self-importance ; a gloomy and malicious clown , he longs for greatness ; and forced to laugh , he despises laughter . Thus , assuming important airs beyond measure , he goes up to the middle of the mountain and waits there in a haughty pose . But his uncertain importance is devoured by the silence , even as dry wood is devoured by fire — and he begins to hurry , without holding out the pause , like a poor musician , striving to conceal himself and his doubts and his odious fear in a vast deal of jests , in loud shouting and in rapid gestures . He stamps his foot and shouts in a voice of assumed sternness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Why are there no trumpets here ? Why no celebration ? Why are these old and rusty gates closed ? And why does no one hand me the keys ? Is it proper in decent circles to meet thus an eminent guest , the reigning prince of the earth , which is friendly to us ? Only the doorkeeper is here , apparently asleep , and no one else . It is bad — bad ! He bursts into laughter , and stretching himself wearily , sits down upon a rock . He speaks humbly and with an air of fatigue . But I am not vainglorious . Trumpets , flowers , and shouting — all this is useless ! I myself heard at one time how the people trumpeted glory for David Leizer , but what has come of it ? He heaves a sigh . It is sad to think of it . He whistles mournfully . You have surely heard of the misfortune that has come upon my friend David Leizer ? I remember when I last chatted with you ,— you did not know this name then .... But do you know it now ? It is a name to be proud of ! When I left the earth , the entire earth in a million of hungry throats called this glorious name , shouting : “ David is a deceiver ! David is a traitor ! David is a liar ! ” Then it seemed to me that some of the people reproached also another one — for my honest friend , who died an untimely death , did not act so incautiously in his own name . The Guardian is silent . And Anathema shouts now with an air of real triumph , breathing malice . The name ! Call the name of him who has ruined David and thousands of people ! I , Anathema , have no heart , my eyes have dried up from the fire of Hell , and there are no tears in them , but if the tears were there I would have given them all to David . I have no heart , but there was an instant when something five trembled in my chest , and I was frightened : I wondered whether a heart could be born . I saw how David was perishing and thousands of people with him , I saw how his spirit , grown dark , curled up piteously like a dead worm in the sun , was hurled down into the abyss of non-existence , into my abode of darkness and death .... Tell me , are you not the one who has ruined David ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUARDIAN OF THE ENTRANCES</speaker>
     <p>David has attained immortality , and he lives forever in the deathlessness of fire . David has attained immortality , and he fives forever in the deathlessness of fight , which is fife . Dumfounded , Anathema falls to the ground and lies motionless for an instant . Then he lifts his head , which is as angry as that of a serpent . He rises and speaks with the calm of boundless wrath .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>You fie ! Forgive me my daring , but you fie . Surely your power is immense — and you can give immortality to a dead worm that has turned black from the sun . But would that be just ? Or do the numbers fie to which you , too , must submit ? Or do all the scales fie , and is all your world nothing but one fie ,— a cruel and mad game of laws , a malicious laugh of a despot at the dumbness and submissiveness of the slave ? He speaks gloomily , in the grief of deathless blindness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>I am tired of searching . I have grown tired of life , of aimless tortures — of the quest after the ever elusive . Give me death , but do not torment me with ignorance ; answer me honestly , even as I am honest in my uprising as a slave . Did not David love ? Answer . Did not David give his soul away ? Answer . And did they not stone David , who had given his soul away ? Answer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUARDIAN</speaker>
     <p>Yes . They stoned David , who had given his soul away .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Smiling darkly . Now you are honest and you answer me with modesty . Without having stilled the hunger of the hungry , without having restored sight to the blind , without having brought to life those who had died innocently ,— having stirred up dissension and dispute and cruel bloodshed , for the people have already risen against one another and are committing violence , murder , and plunder in the name of David ,— did not David manifest the powerlessness of love , and did he not create a great evil which could be numbered and weighed ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUARDIAN</speaker>
     <p>Yes . David has done that which you say ; and the people have done that of which you accuse them . And the numbers do not lie , and the scales are correct , and every measure is what it is .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Triumphantly .</l>
      <l>You say that !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUARDIAN</speaker>
     <p>But that which you do not know , Anathema , is not measured with a measure , and is not calculated in numbers , and is not weighed on scales . Light has no boundaries , nor is there any boundary for the glow of fire — there is a red fire , and there is a yellow fire , and there is a white fire , in which the sun bums like a yellow straw ,— and there is still another unknown fire , whose name no one knows — for there is no limit to the glow of fire . Having died in numbers , having died in measures and in weights , David has attained immortality in the deathlessness of fire .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA ,</speaker>
     <p>You lie again ! He flings himself about on the ground in despair .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Oh , who will help the honest Anathema ? He is being deceived eternally . Oh , who will help the unfortunate Anathema ? His immortality is deception . Oh , weep , you who have grown fond of the Devil ; wail and grieve , you who strive for truth , who honor wisdom ,— Anathema is being deceived eternally . When I win , he takes it away from me . When I come out victorious , he fetters the conqueror in chains , he pricks out the eyes of the ruler , and to the haughty he gives the traits of a dog , a wagging and quivering tail . David , David , I was a friend to you ,— tell him that he lies . He puts his head down on his outstretched arms , like a dog , and wails bitterly . Where is the truth ? Where is the truth ? Where is the truth ? Was it not crushed with stones ? Is it not lying in the ditch together with the carrion ? Oh , the light has died out from the world ! Oh , the world has no eyes !... he crows have pecked them out .... Where is the truth ? Where is the truth ? Where is the truth ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Plaintively</speaker>
     <p>Tell me , will Anathema ever learn the truth ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUARDIAN</speaker>
     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANATHEMA</speaker>
     <p>Tell me , will Anathema ever see the gates open ? Shall I ever see your face ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GUARDIAN</speaker>
     <p>No . Never . My face is open , but you see it not . My speech is loud , but you hear it not . My commands are clear , but you know them not , Anathema . And you will never see , and you will never hear , and you will never know , Anathema , unfortunate spirit , deathless in numbers , ever alive in measure and in weight , but as yet unborn to life . Anathema leaps to his feet .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>You lie ,— silent dog , you who have robbed the world of the truth , you who have barred the entrances with iron ! Farewell ; I like a fair game , and I pay when I lose . And if you will not pay , I shall cry before the whole universe : “ Help ! I have been robbed ! ” He bursts into laughter . Whistling , he retreats a few steps , and turns around . He speaks unconcernedly .</p>

     <p>I have nothing to do , so I roam about the world . Do you know where I am going now ? I shall go to the grave of David Leizer . Like a grieving widow , like the son of a father who had been murdered from behind the corner by a traitor 's blow ,— I shall sit down on David Leizer 's grave and shall weep so bitterly , and cry so loudly , and call so terribly , that not one honest soul will remain that would not curse the murderer . Insane from grief , I shall point to the right and to the left .... Was not this the one who killed him ? Did not that one assist in the bloody crime ? Did not that one betray ? I shall cry so bitterly , I shall accuse so sternly , that all on earth will become murderers and hangmen , in the name of Leizer , in the name of David Leizer , in the name of David , who brought joy to mankind ! And when from the heap of corpses , of filthy , foulsmelling , and disgusting corpses I shall announce to the people that you are the one who killed David and the people ,— they will believe me . Bursts into laughter . For you have such a bad reputation — of a liar , a deceiver , a murderer . Good-by . He goes off laughing . His laughter resounds once more from the depths . And then everything relapses into silence .</p>
