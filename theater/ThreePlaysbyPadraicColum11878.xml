   <div type="dedication">
    <p>TO MY FRIEND THOMAS HUGHES KELLY THESE THREE IRISH PLAYS AUTHOR 'S NOTE I have been asked to say something about the intentions and ideas that underlie the three short plays in this volume .</p>
   </div>
   <titlePage>
    <docImprint>These plays were conceived in the early days of the Irish National Theatre . I had been one of the group that formed the National Theatre Society and I wrote plays for players who were my colleagues and my instructors ; I wrote them for a small , barely-furnished stage in a small theatre ; I wrote them , too , for an audience that was tremendously interested in every expression of national character . “ The Land ” was written to celebrate the redemption of the soil of Ireland — an event made possible by the Land Act of<date>1903</date>. This event , as it represented the passing of Irish acres from an alien landlordism , was considered to be of national importance . “ The Land ” also dealt with a movement that ran counter to the rooting of the Celtic people in the soil — emigration — the emigration to<country>America</country>of the young and the fit . In “ The Land ” I tried to show that it was not altogether an economic necessity that was driving young men and women out of the Irish rural districts ; the lack of life and the lack of freedom there had much to do with emigration . “ The Land ” touched upon a typical conflict , the conflict between the individual and that which , in Ireland , has much authority , the family group . This particular conflict was shown again in “ The Fiddler 's House . ” where the life , not of the actual peasants , but of rural people with artistic and aristocratic traditions , was shown .</docImprint>
   </titlePage>
   <performance>I tried to show the same conflict working out more tragically in the play of middle-class life , “ Thomas Muskerry . ” Here I went above the peasant and the wandering artist and came to the official . I had intended to make plays about the merchant , the landowner , the political and the intellectual leader and so write a chapter in an Irish Human Comedy . But while I was thinking of the play that is third in this volume my connection with the National Theatre Society was broken off . “ Thomas Muskerry ” was produced in the Abbey Theatre after I had ceased to be a member of the group that had founded it .</performance>

   <head>ACT I</head>
   <stage>SCENE : The interior of a farmer 's cottage ; the kitchen . The entrance is at the back right . To the left is the fire-place , an open hearth , with a fire of peat . There is a room door to the right , a pace below the entrance ; and another room door below the fire-place . Between the room door and the entrance there is a row of wooden pegs , on which men 's coats hang . Below this door is a dresser containing pretty delpht . There is a small window at back , a settle bed folded into a high bench ; a small mirror hangs right of the window . A backed chair and some stools are about the hearth . A table to the right with cloth and tea things on it . The cottage looks pretty and comfortable . It is towards the close of an Autumn day .</stage>
   <stage>James Moynihan has finished tea ; Anne Hourican is at the back , seated on the settle knitting , and watching James . James Moynihan is about twenty-eight . He has a good forehead , but his face is indeterminate . He has been working in the fields , and is dressed in trousers , shirt , and heavy boots . Anne Hourican is a pretty , dark-haired girl of about nineteen .</stage>
   <stage>James Moynihan rises .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE And so you can n't stay any longer , James ?</stage>
   <stage>JAMES ( with a certain solemnity ) No , Anne . I told my father I 'd be back while there was light , and I 'm going back . ( He goes to the rack , takes his coat , and puts it on him ) Come over to our house to-night , Anne . I 'll be watching the girls coming in , and thinking on yourself ; there 's none of them your match for grace and favour . My father wanted me to see a girl in Arvach . She has three hundred pounds , besides what the priest , her uncle , will leave her . “ Father , ” says I , “ listen to me now . Have n't I always worked for you like a steady , useful boy ? ” “ You have , ” says he . “ Did I ever ask you for anything unreasonable ? ” says I . “ No , ” says he . “ Well then , ” says I , “ do n't ask me to do unreasonable things . I 'm fond of Anne Hourican , and not another girl will I marry . What 's money , after all ? ” says I , “ there 's gold on the whin-bushes if you only knew it . ” And he had to leave it at that .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE You always bring people around .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES The quiet , reasonable way is the way that people like .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Still , with all , I 'm shy of going into your house .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES Do n't doubt but there 'll be a welcome before you ; come round with Maire .</stage>
   <stage>Anne rises , and comes to him . She has graceful , bird-like movements .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE ( putting her hands on James ’ shoulders ) Maybe we wo n't have a chance of seeing each other after all .</stage>
   <stage>James Moynihan kisses her reverently</stage>
   <stage>JAMES Sit down now , Anne , because there 's something I want to show you . Do you ever see “ The Shamrock ” ?</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Very seldom .</stage>
   <stage>James and Anne go to the settle ; they sit down .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES There be good pieces in it sometimes . There 's a poem of mine in it this week .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Of yours , James ? Printed , do you mean ?</stage>
   <stage>JAMES Ay , printed . ( He takes a paper out of his pocket , and opens it ) It 's a poem to yourself , though your name does n't come into it . ( Gives paper ) Let no one see it , Anne , at least not for the present . And now , good-bye .</stage>
   <stage>Goes to the door . Anne continues reading the verse eagerly . At the door James turns and recites :—</stage>
   <stage>When lights are failing , and skies are paling , And leaves are sailing a-down the air , O , it 's then that love lifts my heart above My roving thoughts and my petty care ; And though the gloom be like the tomb , Where there 's no room for my love and me , O , still I 'll find you , and still I 'll bind you , My wild sweet rose of Aughnalee !</stage>
   <stage>That 's the first stanza . Good-bye .</stage>
   <stage>James goes out . Anne continues reading , then she leaves the paper down with a sigh .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE O , it 's lovely ! ( She takes the paper up again , rises and goes to the door . She remains looking out . Some one speaks to her ) No , Brian , Maire 's not back yet . Ay , I 'll engage she 'll give you a call when she does come back . ( Anne turns back . She opens drawer in the dresser and puts paper in . She begins to clear table , putting the delpht back on dresser . To herself , anxiously ) I hope Maire wo n't forget to call at the mill . ( Room door right opens , and Conn Hourican comes down . Conn Hourican is a man of about fifty , with clear-cut , powerful features , his face is clean-shaven , his expression vehement . His dress is old-fashioned . He wears knee-breeches , a frieze coat rather long , a linen shirt with a little linen collar and a black string for bow . He carries a slick and moves about restlessly )</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Had Maire any talk of going to the mill , father ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN I heard nothing of it .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE I hope she 'll mind of it . We must get the meal there , and not be going to the shop so often .</stage>
   <stage>CONN I suppose we must .</stage>
   <stage>He moves about restlessly .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE And I was just thinking that one of us ought to go to Arvach on Tuesday , and get the things there .</stage>
   <stage>CONN The mean , odious creatures !</stage>
   <stage>Anne is startled . She turns from dresser .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE What are you thinking of , father ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN That den of robbers . Well , well , I 'm finished with them now ; but I 'm a proud man , and a passionate man , and I 'll be even with them yet .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE There 's no comfort in going into rough places .</stage>
   <stage>CONN You know nothing at all about it . Were the men in yet ?</stage>
   <stage>ANNE James Moynihan was here , because he had to go away early ; but Brian MacConnell is outside still . Father , you were home late two nights this week .</stage>
   <stage>CONN And is a man to have no life to himself ? But sure you know nothing at all about it . I 'm going out now to give Brian MacConnell a hand .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE It 's hardly worth while going out now .</stage>
   <stage>CONN There 's still light enough to do a bit of mowing , and you ought to know that it is n't right to neglect the boy that 's come to do a day 's work with you . ( Going to the door ) Many 's the day I put in with the scythe in Ireland , and in England too ; I did more than stroll with the fiddle , and I saw more places than where fiddling brought me . ( Brian MacConnell comes to the door ) I was just going out to you , Brian . I was telling the girl here that it 's not right to neglect the boy that 's giving you a day 's work out of his own goodness .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN I 'm only coming in for a light .</stage>
   <stage>CONN As you 're here now , rest yourself .</stage>
   <stage>Brian MacConnell comes in , and goes over to the hearth . He is dark and good-looking , and has something reckless in his look . He wears corduroy trousers , and a shirt loose at the neck . Anne comes to Brian . Conn stands at entrance , his back turned .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN ( lighting his pipe with a coal ) When do you expect Maire back ?</stage>
   <stage>ANNE She 'll be here soon . Shell give you a call if you 're outside ,</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN How is it you could n't keep James Moynihan ?</stage>
   <stage>ANNE It 's because you did n't say the good word for me , I must think . Be sure you praise me the next time you 're working together .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN Will you do as much for me ?</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Indeed , I will , Brian . Myself and another are making a devotion to Saint Anthony .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN And what would that be for ?</stage>
   <stage>ANNE That the Saint might send us good comrades .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN I thought it was Saint Joseph did that for the girls .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Sure we could n't be asking the like from him . We could n't talk to Saint Joseph that way . We want a nice young saint to be looking at .</stage>
   <stage>Conn turns from the door .</stage>
   <stage>CONN ( bitterly ) It 'll be a poor season , Brian MacConnell .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN The season 's not so bad , after all .</stage>
   <stage>CONN God help them that are depending on the land and the weather for the bit they put into their heads . It 's no wonder that the people here are the sort they are , harassed , anxious people .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE The people here mind their own business , and they 're a friendly people besides .</stage>
   <stage>CONN People that would leave the best fiddler at the fair to go and look at a bullock .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE ( to Brian ) He 's not satisfied to have this shelter , Brian .</stage>
   <stage>CONN ( to Brian ) I 'm saying , Brian , that her mother had this shelter , and she left it to go the roads with myself .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE That God may rest my mother . It 's a pity she never lived to come back to the place . But we ought to be praising grandmother night and day , for leaving this place to Maire .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Your grandmother did that as she did everything else .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE ( to Brian ) Now , Brian , what would you do with a man that would say the like ?</stage>
   <stage>Anne goes outside .</stage>
   <stage>CONN ( to Brian ) It 's small blame to the girl here for thinking something of the place ; but I saw the time , Brian MacConnell , when I could make more playing at one fair than working a whole season in this bit of a place .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN Girls like the shelter , Conn .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Ay , but the road for the fiddler . I 'm five years settled here , and I come to be as well known as the begging ass , and there is as much thought about me . Fiddling , let me tell you , is n't like a boy 's whistling . It can n't be kept up on nothing .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN I understand that , Conn .</stage>
   <stage>CONN I 'm getting that I can n't stand the talk you hear in houses , wars and Parliaments , and the devil knows what ramais .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN There 's still a welcome for the man of art , somewhere .</stage>
   <stage>CONN That somewhere 's getting further and further away , Brian .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN You were not in the town last night ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN I was not , Brian . God help me , I spent the night my lone .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN There 's Sligomen in the town .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Is there , now ? It would be like our times to play for them . ( Anne comes in with some peat ) Anne , would you bring me down my spectacles ? They 're in the room , daughter . ( Anne goes to room . Conn turns to Brian eagerly ) I suppose the Sligomen will be in Flynn 's .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN They were there last night .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Listen , Brian , I 've a reason for not going to Flynn 's . Would you believe it , Brian , Flynn spoke to me about the few shillings I owe him ?</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN That was shabby of him . He got a lot out of you in the way of playing .</stage>
   <stage>CONN It 's just like them . Besides , Maire keeps us tight enough , and I often have to take treats from the men . They 're drovers and rambling labourers and the like , though , as you say , they 've the song and music , and the proper talk . Listen , Brian , could you leave a few shillings on the dresser for me ?</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN To be sure I will , Conn .</stage>
   <stage>Brian goes to the dresser , and puts money on a shelf .</stage>
   <stage>CONN ( with dignity ) Thank you , Brian . There 's few I 'd let put me under a compliment ; but I take it from you . Maire , as I said , is a careful girl , but some of us must have our freedom . Besides , Brian , the bird that sings lone sings slow . The man of art must have his listeners . ( Conn takes the money off dresser ) Anne , daughter , what 's keeping you there ? Sure the spectacles were in my pocket the whole time , child . ( Anne comes dawn ) When I spoke against the people about here , I was leaving you out of it , Brian .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN I 'm fond of tune , though it was n't here I got fond of it .</stage>
   <stage>Brian goes to the door .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE ( going to Brian ) You wo n't be rambling again , Brian ?</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN I 'm settled here , Anne ; I made it up with my brothers .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE They used to say that a MacConnell quarrel was a lasting quarrel .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN Maybe we 're working the bad blood out of us .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Do n't be staying out long , Brian .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN Till Maire gives me the call .</stage>
   <stage>Brian MacConnell goes out .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE We ought n't to take another clay from Brian MacConnell . There 's only the patch at the back to be mown , and you could do that yourself .</stage>
   <stage>CONN You can depend on me for the mowing . I 'm going up now , to go over an oul ’ tune I have .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE James Moynihan would come over and stack for us .</stage>
   <stage>CONN James Moynihan is a decent boy , too .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE You wo n't be going out to-night , father ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN Now , how 's a man to know what he 'll be doing ?</stage>
   <stage>ANNE It leaves me very anxious .</stage>
   <stage>CONN I 'll give you this advice , and it 's proper advice to give to a girl thinking of marrying . Never ask of your menkind where they 're going .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE The like of that brings bad luck on a house .</stage>
   <stage>CONN You have too much dead knowledge , and the shut fist never caught a bird .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE I only wish you were settled down .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Sure I am settled down .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE I can n't speak to you , after all .</stage>
   <stage>CONN You 're a good girl , Anne , and he 'll be lucky that gets you . And do n't be grieving that you 're not bringing James Moynihan a fortune . You 're bringing him the decency of birth and rearing . You 're like the lone pigeon I often think — the pet that does n't fly , and keeps near the house .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE That 's the way you always treat me , and I never can talk to you .</stage>
   <stage>CONN ( at window ) Hush now , here 's the other , your sister Maire . She 's like the wild pigeon of the woods . ( Maire Hourican comes in ) We were discoursing on affairs , Maire . We wo n't be bringing Brian MacConnell here tomorrow ; there 's only the bit at the back to be mown , and I 'll do that myself .</stage>
   <stage>Conn Hourican goes into the room right ; soon after the fiddle is heard . Anne goes to the settle , and takes up her knitting . Maire takes her shawl off , and hangs it on the rack . Maire Hourican is over twenty . She is tall , and has easy , graceful movements ; her features are fine and clear-cut ; the nose is rather blunted , the mouth firm . Her gaze is direct and clear . She has heavy auburn hair , loose now , and falling . Maire comes down to the table , opens basket , and takes some flowers from top . She turns to dresser and arranges some of the flowers in a jar .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE We 'd have no right to take another day from Brian . And when there 's no one here to-morrow , you and me could draw some of the turf .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Your hair is loose , Maire .</stage>
   <stage>Maire goes to the mirror and fixes her hair .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE The wind blew it about me , and then I let it down . I came home by the long way , just to feel young again with my hair about me .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE And did you meet any one ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Indeed I did . I met James Moynihan .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE James had to go early . They 're building at his place .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Indeed they ought to let James build a house for himself . ANNE Some day they will , Maire .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE But we must not let some day be a far day .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE ( hesitatingly ) I think I 'll show you something .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE What is it , daughter ?</stage>
   <stage>Anne rises and goes to the dresser . She opens drawer . Maire watches her .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE ( waiting ) I made a good girl out of you , anyway .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE You would n't let me use stroller words when we were on the road . Do you mind of that ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I kept you to the mannerly ways . I have that to my credit .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE ( showing Maire the verses ) Read that , Maire . It was James that made it .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE It 's a song , I declare .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE No , Maire , it 's a poem .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE A poem ? O , that 's grand !</stage>
   <stage>She begins to read it eagerly .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE And , Maire —</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Well ?</stage>
   <stage>ANNE James says it 's about me .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE About you ? O , I wish some one would put me into a song , or into a poem ; I suppose a poem would be best . You might ask James . No , I 'll coax him myself . Ah , no I wo n't , Anne .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE You may keep it for a while , but do n't let any one know .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE He must be very fond of you , and I thinking him so quiet .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE ( happy ) He has grand thoughts about me .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Well , you 'll be seeing him to-night .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE I do n't know that I 'll go out to-night .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Sure Grace Moynihan asked us to go over .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE I 'm shy of going into James ’ .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Anne , you 're the only one of us that has any manners . Maybe you 're right not to go .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE I 'll stay in to-night .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Then Brian and myself will go to Moynihan 's .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE You 'd get an indulgence , Maire , if you missed a dance .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Would it be so hard to get an indulgence ? ( She takes flowers from dresser and puts them in window ) The house looks nice this evening . We 'll keep Brian here for a while , and then we 'll go to Moynihan 's .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Father will be going out to-night .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE ( turning suddenly from window ) Will he ?</stage>
   <stage>ANNE He will . I think I ought to stay in . Maire , father was in only a while before you the night before last and another night .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE O , and I thinking things were going so well with us . He 's drinking again .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE He 's going to Flynn 's again .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Disgracing us again .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE I 'll stay in to-night .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I 'm tired of this .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Do n't say it that way , Maire .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE What will people say of us two now ?</stage>
   <stage>ANNE I 'll talk to him to-night .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE No , you 're going out — you 're going to Moynihan 's — you 're going to see your sweetheart .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE I think you 're becoming a stranger to us , Maire .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE You 're going to Moynihan 's to-night , and I 'm going , too . But I 'm going to settle this first . Once and for all I 'm going to settle this .</stage>
   <stage>The fiddle has ceased . As Maire goes towards the room , Conn Hourican comes down , the fiddle in his hand .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Were you listening to the tune I was playing ? Ah , that was a real oul tune , if there was anyone that knew it . Maire , my jewel , were you listening ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I heard you .</stage>
   <stage>CONN It was a real oul ’ tune , and while I was playing it a great scheme came into my head . Now , listen to me , Maire ; and you listen , too , Anne . Both of you would like to see your father having what 's his due after all , honour and respect .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Both of us would like to see our father earn the same .</stage>
   <stage>CONN I could earn the same , ay , and gold and silver cups besides , if I had the mind to earn them .</stage>
   <stage>He puts fiddle on table and prepares to speak impressively .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Let ye listen to me now ; I 've a scheme to put before ye . When I was going over the oul tune , I remembered that I 'd heard of a Feis<span type="note_anchor">[ 2 ]</span>that 's coming on soon , the Feis of Ardagh . I 'm thinking of going there . There will be great prizes for some one ; I do n't doubt but I 'd do at Ardagh better than I did at the Feis of Granard , where people as high as bishops were proud and glad to know Conn Hourican the Fiddler .</stage>
   <stage>[ Footnote 2 : Feis , pronounced Fesh , a musical or literary gathering , with competitions . ]</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Father , you 've a place to mind .</stage>
   <stage>CONN I 'm tired of that kind of talk ; sure I 'm always thinking of the place . Maire has n't little notions . What do you say to it , Maire , my girl ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE What do I say ? I say you 're not a rambler now , though indeed you behave like one .</stage>
   <stage>CONN You have something against me , Maire .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I have .</stage>
   <stage>CONN What has she against me , Anne ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE All the promises you broke .</stage>
   <stage>CONN You were listening to what the town is saying .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE What does the town know ? Does it know that you stripped us of stock and crop the year after we came here ? Does it know that Anne and myself , two girls of the roads , had to struggle ever since to keep a shelter ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN ( bitterly ) It knows that . It could n't help but know it , maybe . But does it know all the promises you made and broke ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN ( angrily ) Hush now ; I 'll hear no more . I went my own way always , and I 'll go my own way always .</stage>
   <stage>He goes to the entrance , and remains with his back turned . Maire goes to Anne .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE ( raising her voice ) Ay , he 'll go his own way always . What was the good of working and saving here ?</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Be quiet with him .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE He 'll go his own way always , and it 's foolish of us to be fretting for him night and day .</stage>
   <stage>Maire sits on stool and puts her hands across her face .</stage>
   <stage>CONN ( turning his head ) Fretting for me . It was too easy that I reared you .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE God help Maire ! She kept the house together at the worst , and she is always fretting for us .</stage>
   <stage>CONN I 'm oul ’ enough to mind myself . Let her remember that .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE It 's you that ought to remember that .</stage>
   <stage>CONN ( going to Maire ) Did I ever give the harsh word to you , child ?</stage>
   <stage>No answer .</stage>
   <stage>CONN There , there ; I never could see tears in a woman 's eyes ; there , there , colleen . I 'm an oul ’ man ; I wo n't be a trouble to you long .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE ( rising ) Why need you play in Flynn 's ? You 're as good as any that goes there .</stage>
   <stage>CONN I know that . I 'm disgusted with Flynn . May hell loosen his knees for him ! I 'll go in and throw his money on the counter .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Some one else can do that . Promise me you wo n't go near the place .</stage>
   <stage>CONN You 'll have me promise . I promise .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Take this in your hand and promise . It 's a medal that belonged to mother .</stage>
   <stage>She takes a medal from her neck</stage>
   <stage>CONN ( taking the medal ) I 'm disgusted with Flynn . I promise you , Maire .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Now you 've honour and respect .</stage>
   <stage>CONN And what about Ardagh , Maire ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Sure , you 're not the rambling fiddler any more .</stage>
   <stage>CONN That would be the good rambling . I see the trees making shadows across the roads .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE We 'll talk about it again .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Brian MacConnell will be coming in now . CONN I 'm going out to Brian MacConnell .</stage>
   <stage>He goes to the door .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Tell Brian to come in now .</stage>
   <stage>Conn Hourican goes out . There is a pause . Maire hums a tune as she goes to the mirror .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Am I looking well to-day ?</stage>
   <stage>ANNE ( rather distantly ) You 're looking your best , I think . ( Seriously ) Maire , I did n't like the way you talked to father .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE ( petulantly ) What have you against it ?</stage>
   <stage>ANNE You 're becoming a stranger to us , Maire .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE ( as an apology ) I 'm out often , I know , but I think as much as ever of the house , and about you and father . You know we could n't let him go to the Feis at Ardagh . We could n't let him go off like a rambling fiddler .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE We could n't let him go off by himself .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE You 're going to Moynihan 's .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Maybe I 'll go .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Anne , honey , do something for me .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE What will I do ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE You 'll meet father coming up with Brian , and take him away .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE And will you tell me everything to-night ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Who else would I talk to but yourself , Nancy ? ( Anne goes out ) I wish Anne had n't spoken to me like that . I feel the like of that . ( Desperately ) Well , I 'll pray for nothing now but to look my best . ( She goes to the fire . Brian MacConnell comes in ) You 're welcome , Brian .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN We did n't finish to-day . I 'll come in to-morrow and finish .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE O no , Brian , we wo n't take another day from you .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN Well , what 's a day after all ? Many 's the day and night I put in thinking on you .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE But did you do what I asked you to do ?</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN I did . I made it up with my brothers . It was never my way before . What I wanted I took with the strong hand ; or if I might n't put the strong hand on it , I left it alone .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE ( eagerly ) Tell me what your brother said to you .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN When I came up to the door , Hugh came out to meet me . “ What destruction are you bringing me ? ” he said . “ There 's my hand , ” says I , “ and I take your offer . ” MAIRE Ah , that 's settled . You could settle anything , Brian . ( She goes to the settle and sits down ) I wonder could you settle something for us ?</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN What is it , Maire ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE It 's my father . He wants to be rambling again . He wants to be going to some Feis .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN Sure , let him go .</stage>
   <stage>He takes her hand .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I could n't , Brian . Could n't you help us ? Could n't you keep father 's mind on the right things ?</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN Sure , let the fiddler go on the roads .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE You might stay here this evening with ourselves . Father would be glad to talk with you .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN ( putting his arm around her ) But I want the two of us to be seen in Moynihan 's to-night .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE ( resistance in her voice ) Stay here with us , and let all that go by .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN Hugh will be there with that woman that brought him the big fortune ; and I want you to take the shine out of her .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE ( rising ) I was out often lately . You know that , Brian .</stage>
   <stage>She goes to chair at table , and sits away from him .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN ( rising and going to her ) But this night above all you must be with me .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE ( turning to him impulsively ) Stay here and I 'll be as nice to you as if we were in another house . ( He kisses her . She rises and goes from him ) If you knew me at all , Brian MacConnell , that 's not the way you 'd treat me .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN Are you not coming out with me ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE You must leave me to myself now . ( Conn Hourican comes in ) Is Anne with you , father ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN She 's gathering posies or something like that . Brian , did you hear about the Feis at Ardagh ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE ( with vehemence ) Oh , what 's the good of talking about that ? You can n't go .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Ca n't go , did you say , girl ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Oh , how could you go ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN Is that the way ? Well , God help us . Give me that fiddle till I leave it up .</stage>
   <stage>He takes the fiddle off dresser , and turns to go .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Father , let me be with you to-night ; oh , I 'm sorry if I vexed you . ( No reply ) Well , stay with Brian MacConnell ; I 'm going out to Anne .</stage>
   <stage>Maire goes out . Brian goes to rack , and puts on his coat .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN Are you coming , Conn ? I 'm off .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Where to , man ?</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN To Flynn 's .</stage>
   <stage>CONN I can n't be going , I 'm sorry to say .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN I 'm going anyway . It 's a great thing to be in the company of men .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Ay , in troth . Women , Brian , leave the heart of one very lonesome .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN ( masterfully ) Why can n't you come out ? I thought you were going to-night .</stage>
   <stage>CONN I can n't , Brian , and that reminds me . Give these few shillings to Flynn for me . I 'll owe them to you still .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN I 'm not going to be bothered by the like . Why can n't you come ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN I promised Maire .</stage>
   <stage>Brian strides away . He turns , comes back deliberately , and sits on table beside Conn .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN They 'll be all looking out for you at Flynn 's .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Well , the next time they see me they may respect me .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN Some of the boys will take it very unkindly . CONN They 're decent enough fellows , some of them .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN And above all nights they 'll be watching out for you this night , on account of the Sligomen .</stage>
   <stage>CONN They 're decent enough fellows , as I said , and I 'll be sorry to disappoint them .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN The Sligomen will have great stories about Shawn Heffernan .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Shawn Heffernan ! Is that impostor still alive ?</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN He is , and for fiddling these Sligomen think there 's not the like of him in the whole of Ireland .</stage>
   <stage>CONN God help them if that 's all they know . We played against each other at the Granard Feis . He got the prize , but everybody knew that it was me played the best .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN There 's few of them alive now that mind of the Granard Feis . He got the prize , and there 's no talk of you at all .</stage>
   <stage>CONN No talk of me at all ?</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN It 's said that since you settled down you lost your art .</stage>
   <stage>CONN And what had the men at Flynn 's to say about that ? BRIAN They bragged about you for a while , but the Sligomen put them down .</stage>
   <stage>CONN I wonder would we have time to go up , play a few tunes , and come back , while Maire would be doing something ? It would be a pity not to give them fellows a lesson and close their ignorant mouths for them . I wonder would we have time ? ( Anne comes in with Maire ) I thought you went somewhere and left Brian and myself here .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE We 're going somewhere and Brian might come with us .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Every one is going to Moynihan 's .</stage>
   <stage>CONN It 's a pleasant house , a pleasant house . Brian will make his ceilidh<span type="note_anchor">[ 3 ]</span>with me . We might go over a few tunes .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Let Brian come where there are girls that might miss him .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Anne , you 're a great one for keeping up the story that girls are always thinking about men .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE And so they are . Just as men are always thinking about girls .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE You 'd make a good ribbonman .<span type="note_anchor">[ 4 ]</span>You 'd put a face on anything you said .</stage>
   <stage>[ Footnote 3 : Celidh , pronounced cayley , a visit . ]</stage>
   <stage>[ Footnote 4 : A ribbonman — a member of a secret agrarian society . ]</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Ribbonism and secret societies were denounced off the altar .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Goodness ! The men will begin to think they 've secrets worth telling .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Have you secrets worth telling , Brian ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I daresay he has . There are foolish women in the world .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Are you coming to Moynihan 's , Brian ?</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN No . I 'm going where there 's men .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Come , Anne , till I deck you out . Come here , daughter , do n't wear flowers . I think they 're unlucky . Here I am talking like this , and I going to a dance . I suppose I 'll dance with seven or eight and forget what 's on my mind .... Everyone is going to Moynihan 's except the men here . Are you going out , father ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN I 'm making a ceilidh with Brian .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Well , God be with you both . Come on , Anne .</stage>
   <stage>Maire takes down her shawl , and puts it over her head . She stands at the door , watching Anne , who goes to Brian .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Brian , what have you against Moynihan 's ?</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN Nothing at all . I may go in . MAIRE Come on , Anne . God be with you both .</stage>
   <stage>Maire and Anne go out . They are heard talking for a while . Conn goes to the door .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Maire and Anne are turning the bohereen .<span type="note_anchor">[ 5 ]</span>Come on now .</stage>
   <stage>He takes his fiddle and begins to wrap it up eagerly .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN Ay , let 's go .</stage>
   <stage>CONN ( at door ) I never forget , I never forget . The Granard Feis is as fresh in my mind as the day I played at it . Shawn Heffernan , indeed ! I never forget . I never forget .</stage>
   <stage>Conn Hourican and Brian MacConnell go out .</stage>
   <stage>[ Footnote 5 : Bohereen — the little path going from the cottage to the main road . ]</stage>
   <p>CURTAIN</p>
   <p>ACT II</p>
   <stage>The next day : The scene is as in previous Act . It is now in the forenoon . Maire Hourican is seated at the fire in a listless attitude . Anne is busy at the dresser . Maire rises .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE We should n't have stayed at Moynihan 's so late .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Indeed it would have been better to go home , but I was sure that Brian MacConnell would come in .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Well , it was his own loss if he did n't come . Maybe there was one there that I liked better .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE You could n't have liked Connor Gilpatrick better than Brian MacConnell .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Connor 's the best-looking boy in the country . Was it noticed that we were together often ?</stage>
   <stage>ANNE ( significantly ) Peggy Carroll noticed it .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Well , the boy was glad to talk to me . Connor 's a good dancer , and he has fine talk besides . If Brian MacConnell had come to the door , I would n't have turned my head towards him .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Sure , you would n't compare a young boy like Connor Gilpatrick with Brian MacConnell ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I would n't have turned my head towards Brian . O ! never expect kindness from men . Why did you let me stay on ? I 'm afraid to look at myself in the glass to-day . ( She goes over to the mirror ) You were hard on me , Anne , yesterday .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE I did n't like the way you talked to father .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I think I 'm getting different to what I used to be . Well , I 've reason to be sorry for what I did yesterday . ( She is at window ) Was Peggy Carroll vexed at the way I went on ?</stage>
   <stage>ANNE She never took her eyes off the pair of you . You know she 's very fond of Connor .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Anne , never remind me of my foolishness , I 'm heartsick of myself to-day .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE I 'll comb out your hair for you , and you 'll look well enough .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Then you 're expecting Brian MacConnell ?</stage>
   <stage>ANNE It 's likely he 'll come in to see if there 's anything to be done .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I suppose he 'll come in . Gracious , how did father get out ? He 's coming up the path .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE ( coming to Maire ) Father 's not up , surely ? Maire , be easy with Brian MacConnell when he comes in .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Father 's coming up the path . Anne !</stage>
   <stage>ANNE What is it , Maire ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Father was n't in at all , last night .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Then he went to Flynn 's , after all .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Ay , he went to Flynn 's .</stage>
   <stage>She goes to Anne .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE O Maire , what will become of us all ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I do n't know .</stage>
   <stage>Maire goes to the settle , and sits down .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE What will we do with him at all ?</stage>
   <stage>Conn Hourican comes in .</stage>
   <stage>CONN God save you ! ( He looks around ) Well , I came back to ye .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE You did , God help us ! And we depending on you . It 's the bad way you always treated us .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Did you hear what happened to me , before you attack me ?</stage>
   <stage>ANNE What happened to you ? What always happens to you ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN I wonder that a man comes in at all ! The complaints against him are like the Queen 's Speech , prepared beforehand .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Ever since I can remember , you treated us like that . Bringing us into drinking-places and we little . It 's well we got to know anything , or got into the way of being mannerly at all .</stage>
   <stage>CONN You know too much . I always said that . Is James Moynihan coming here to-day ?</stage>
   <stage>ANNE No , he is n't coming here to-day .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Well , we can do without him . There 's something to be done to-day . I said I 'd do the bit of mowing , and I was thinking of that all along . ( He looks at Maire ) Did you hear what happened to me , Maire ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE It 's no matter at all .</stage>
   <stage>CONN I went over to Flynn 's , I may tell you .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE In troth we might have known that .</stage>
   <stage>CONN But did you hear what happened to me ?</stage>
   <stage>ANNE How could we hear ? It was Maire went to the door , and there you were coming up the path ; and we thinking you were in bed , resting yourself .</stage>
   <stage>CONN I went over to Flynn 's , but I had good reason for going there . ( He puts the fiddle down on the table ) Did n't you hear there were Sligomen in the town , Maire ? Well , one of them was in the way of rewarding the prizes . I told you about the Feis ; well , it 's no matter now , I 'll say no more about that . At all events the man I mentioned wanted to know what music was in the country , so he sent a message to myself .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE ( as satirical as she can be ) That was kind of him .</stage>
   <stage>CONN It was . I could do no less than go . I 'll rest myself now , and then get ready for the mowing . ( He goes to the room door ; he turns again and watches Maire ) Maire , I 'm sorry you were n't on the spot . You might have advised me . I could n't think of where you went or I 'd have followed you . I had to make haste .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE It 's no matter at all now .</stage>
   <stage>CONN I 'll stretch myself on the bed before I begin work . Anne , did you say you were leaving something in the room for me ?</stage>
   <stage>ANNE I suppose I 'll have to leave the tea in the room for you .</stage>
   <stage>She gets the tea ready . Maire remains motionless .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Well , I have the pattern of daughters , anyway . I would n't give this house for the praise of Ireland , no , not if they carried me on their backs . ( Anne takes the tea up to the room ) It 's a pity you were n't there , Maire , though of course I would n't bring you into such a place . But they were decent fellows , decent , warm-hearted fellows . If you were to see their faces when I played An Chaitin Donn . I 'll warrant they 'll be whistling it , though they never heard the tune before . And the manners they have ! I offered the fiddle to one of them . “ No , ” says he , “ not a string will I touch while the master of us is here . ” That 's something like the spirit . ( Maire has turned to him and is attentive ) But there , I wo n't fill myself up with false music telling you about it all .</stage>
   <stage>He turns to the room .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Bring up your fiddle .</stage>
   <stage>CONN ( taking fiddle and going towards room again ) It will be as good as sound sleeping for me . I 'll never forget it . Flynn will never forget it . It will be the making of Flynn .</stage>
   <stage>Maire rises .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE You 've only your fiddle ; we should n't forget that .</stage>
   <stage>Conn goes up to the room . Maire turns to the fire . Anne comes down .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE O Maire , what will become of us at all ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE He is very pleased with himself . He has only his fiddle , we should n't forget that .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE It will be a long time till he does the like again .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE It will be a long time , I suppose . Both of us might be in a different house and have different cares .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE That would be terrible . I 'll never leave him , Maire . MAIRE You can n't say the like now .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Why ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE How could you take such things upon you and life stretching out before you ? You 're not young enough , Anne . Besides , it 's not what we say ; it 's what we feel . No , it 's not what we feel either ; it 's what grows up in us .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE He might never do the like again .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Many 's the time mother said that , and she and me lying together .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Will we ever get out of it , Maire ?</stage>
   <stage>James enters .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE You have only a while to stay with us .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE O James , what will your father say if he hears of you giving us another day ?</stage>
   <stage>JAMES My father took a stick in his hand this morning , and went off with himself .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE You 're welcome , James . It was a pleasant time we had in your house last evening .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES I hope you liked the company , Maire . I 'm afraid there was very little to be called refined or scholarly , and the conversation at times was homely enough . But we did our best , and we were proud to see you .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Sit down , James .</stage>
   <stage>James sits on chair , near table . Maire is seated at fire , left of James . Anne leans against table , right of him .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES Your father is outside , maybe ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE No . He 's above in the room .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES Yes . Practising , I suppose . Them that have the gift have to mind the gift . In this country there is n't much thought for poetry , or music , or scholarship . Still , a few of us know that a while must be spared from the world if we are to lay up riches in the mind .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE I hope there 's nothing wrong at home ?</stage>
   <stage>JAMES ( turning to Anne ) To tell you the truth , Anne , and to keep nothing back , there is .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE And what is it , James ?</stage>
   <stage>JAMES ( turning to Maire ) Anne was talking to my father last night .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Indeed I was , and I thought him very friendly to me .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES Ay , he liked you well enough , I can tell you that , Anne . This morning when he took a stick in his hand , I knew he was making ready for a journey , for the horse is laid up . “ Walk down a bit with me , ” said he , “ and we 'll go over a few things that are in my mind . ” Well , I walked down with him , and indeed we had a serious conversation .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Well ?</stage>
   <stage>JAMES “ Anne Hourican is too young , ” said my father ; “ she 's a nice girl , and a good girl , but she 's too young . ”</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Sure in a while Anne will be twenty .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES ( turning to Maire ) Ten years from this father would still think Anne too young . And late marriages , as everybody knows , is the real weakness of the country .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE I thought your father liked me .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES He likes you well enough , but , as he says , “ what would she be doing here and your sisters years older than herself ? ” There 's truth in that , mind you . I always give in to the truth .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE James ?</stage>
   <stage>JAMES ( turning to Maire ) Well , Maire ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Is Anne a girl to be waiting twenty years for a man , like Sally Cassidy ?</stage>
   <stage>JAMES God forbid , Maire Hourican , that I 'd ask your sister to wait that length . MAIRE She has n't got a fortune . We were brought up different to farmers , and maybe we never gave thought to the like .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES She has what 's better than a fortune .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Why are n't your sisters married off ?</stage>
   <stage>JAMES Big fortunes are expected with them .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE And they look to your wife to bring a big fortune into the house ?</stage>
   <stage>JAMES Ay , they do that .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE You , James , ought to have some control in the house . You 're the only son . Your father is well off . Get him to fortune off your sisters , and then bring Anne to the house .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES But how could I get father to fortune off the girls ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE How ? By wakening up . You have the right . When we have the right , we ought to be able to do anything we like with the people around us .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES I give in to the truth of that , Maire .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE What will come of you giving in to the truth of it ? But sure you ought to remember , Anne .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE ( taking James 's hand ) James has the good way with people .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Well , I suppose it will come out right for you in the end . You are both very deserving . ( She rises ) But some time or another we have to take things into our own hands .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES Indeed that 's true , Maire .</stage>
   <stage>Maire goes to back .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE ( holding James 's hand ) Did you make any more songs , James ?</stage>
   <stage>JAMES I have a song in my head since last night .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE The one in the paper is lovely . I know it by heart .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES The next I make will be ten times better .</stage>
   <stage>Conn Hourican comes down .</stage>
   <stage>CONN I heard your voice , James , and I thought I 'd come down . It 's very good of you to come here again . I 'll be out with you to-day .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES It 'll be a good day from this on . Were you practising above , Mister Hourican ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN Well , no , James , I was n't practising . I was at a big gathering last night , and my hands are unstrung like . We 'll talk for a while , and then I 'll go out with you .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE ( taking James 's arm ) Come out with me for a minute , James .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES ( going off ) I 'll see you again , Mister Hourican .</stage>
   <stage>James and Anne go out ,</stage>
   <stage>CONN Well , God help us . ( He turns to go back to the room . Maire comes down from back ) Are you going out , Maire ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE No , I 'm staying here .</stage>
   <stage>CONN ( aggrieved ) Do you mind them two , how they went out together . I think I 'll go out and see what 's to be done about the place .</stage>
   <stage>Conn goes towards the entrance . Maire goes towards the fire .</stage>
   <stage>CONN ( pausing at door ) I broke my word to you , Maire .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I do n't know what to say to you now .</stage>
   <stage>CONN It was the music and the strange faces that drew me .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I know that now .</stage>
   <stage>CONN It will be a long time till I break my word to you again .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I 'll never ask for your word again .</stage>
   <stage>CONN ( warmly ) I can tell you this , Maire . There 's many 's the place in Ireland where Conn Hourican 's word would be respected .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I 'll never ask for your word again . You have only your fiddle , and you must go among people that will praise you . When I heard you talking of your listeners , I knew that . I was frightened before that . When I saw you coming , I went and sat there , and I thought the walls of the house were crowding in on me .</stage>
   <stage>CONN You were partly to blame , Maire . You left me there very lonesome .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I was to blame , I suppose . I should have treated you differently . Well , I know you better now . Let you sit down and we 'll talk together . ( Conn sits on chair to right of table ) What 's to become of myself I do n't know . Anne and James Moynihan will marry , I hope . Neither of us have fortunes , and for that reason our house should be well spoken of .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Sure I know that . I would n't bring the shadow of a disgrace near ye .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE If the father is n't well spoken of , how could the house be well spoken of ? They 're big drinkers that go to Flynn 's , and it 's easy for the fiddler to get into the way of drinking .</stage>
   <stage>CONN I wo n't go to Flynn 's when you put it that way .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I 'll ask for no word . I 'll let you know the real way of the house , and then trust you .</stage>
   <stage>CONN You 're a good girl , Maire . I should have been said by you .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE From this out there will be dances at the schoolhouse and the like of that . You could be playing at them . CONN None of the oul ’ people go to the like , and the young do n't understand me nor my ways . God knows will I ever play again . That thought is often with me of late , and it makes me very lonesome .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE That 's foolishness .</stage>
   <stage>CONN I was very lonesome when you left me . You do n't know how I was tempted , Maire . There was Brian MacConnell putting on his coat to go to Flynn 's , and talking of the Sligomen .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE ( startled ) And was it to Flynn 's that Brian MacConnell went ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN It was Brian that brought me to Flynn 's .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Was it Brian MacConnell that brought you to Flynn 's ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN It was .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE ( passionately ) You must never go to Flynn 's .</stage>
   <stage>CONN I 'm ashamed of myself . Did n't I say that , Maire ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE ( with hardness ) You must never go again .</stage>
   <stage>CONN And is a man to have no life to himself ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE That 's talk just . It 's time you thought of your own place and your own children . It 's time you gave up caring for the praise of foolish people ,</stage>
   <stage>CONN Foolish people , did you say ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Ay , foolish people . You had all your life to yourself , and you went here and there , straying from place to place , and caring only for the praise of foolish people .</stage>
   <stage>CONN God help you , if that 's your way of thinking ! Sure the world knows that a man is born with the gift , and is n't the gift then the sign of the grace of God ? Foolish people , indeed ! Them that know the gift have some of the grace of God , no matter how poor they may be .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE You 're always thinking of them . You never think of your own . Many 's the time your own cried tears over your playing .</stage>
   <stage>CONN ( passionately , starting up ) I 'll go out of the house .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Let you stay here .</stage>
   <stage>CONN ( going towards entrance ) I 'll go out of the house , I tell you .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE No .</stage>
   <stage>Conn goes over to the fire .</stage>
   <stage>CONN God help me that ever came into this country at all . ( He sits down on the armchair , his hands resting on his stick ) I had friends once , and was well thought of ; I can tell you that , my daughter . MAIRE I know that . CONN Well , you can have your own way with me now .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Why can n't you stay here ? There 's lots to be done here . Our fields are a laughing-stock to the neighbours , they 're that poor and wasted . Let us put all our minds into working , and have a good place of our own .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Ay , and the grabbers and informers of this place would think well of you then .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Who do you call grabbers and informers ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN The people of this place . The people you want to shine before .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I do n't want to shine before the people .</stage>
   <stage>CONN I 'm not saying against you , Maire .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE You 're wrong in thinking I want to shine at all .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Sure you go to every dance and ceilidh ; and to every house where you can show off your face , and dancing , and conversation .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Do I ? Maybe I do . Every girl does the like .</stage>
   <stage>CONN I 'm not saying against it .</stage>
   <stage>Pause .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE You think I 'm like yourself , wanting the praise of the people .</stage>
   <stage>CONN And what 's the harm if you do ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE No harm at all . But I do n't go to houses to show myself off .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Troth and you do , Maire .</stage>
   <stage>He rises and goes towards the entrance , and remains looking out .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I wo n't believe it .</stage>
   <stage>She goes to the settle . Anne comes in . Anne goes to the glass to fix her hair .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Had you a good night at Moynihan 's , Anne ?</stage>
   <stage>ANNE A sort of a good night .</stage>
   <stage>CONN I was going to tell you about a man I met last night . He had a song about your grandmother .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Was grandmother a great beauty , father ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN Honor Gilroy had good looks , and indeed she made the most of them .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE It 's likely there was some to tell her that she was showing off .</stage>
   <stage>CONN No one was to her liking unless they praised her .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Ah well , a fiddler ought to forgive that to a woman . MAIRE Fiddlers and women are all alike , but do n't say that to him .</stage>
   <stage>Anne goes to Maire and sits beside her .</stage>
   <stage>CONN ( speaking to both ) Well , Honor Gilroy was n't the worst , maybe .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE And fiddlers and women ought n't be hard on each other .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Do you say that , Maire ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE ( rising and going to him ) I say it , father .</stage>
   <stage>CONN God forgive me if I vexed you , Maire .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE It 's clearing up now , father , and you ought to go out to James . ( Conn turns to the door . He remains in the doorway . Anne rises and goes to Maire ) What did you say to him ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE ( looking at Conn ) He does n't feel it at all . Father will always be the fiddler , no matter what we say .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Maire . Come and talk to me . ( They sit at fire ) I was talking to James . He 'll never be happy until we 're under the one roof .</stage>
   <stage>Maire clasps Anne 's hands passionately .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE ( with cry ) Anne , daughter , I 'll be very lonesome for you .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE But sure I wo n't be far off , Maire .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Ay , but it 's terrible to face things alone .</stage>
   <stage>James has come to the door . Conn and James have been talking . They turn in .</stage>
   <stage>CONN But I 'll be glad enough to have the scythe in my hands after it all , James .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES Anne was telling me how you took the victory from Connaught .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Still I 'm sorry for him ! That poor Heffernan ! He 'll never hold up his head again .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES Sure I 'd have it in a ballad that would be sung in his own town . It would be well worth putting into a ballad .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Well indeed , it would make a right good ballad , James .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES I 'd like to make a ballad about it , that would be sung all over Connaught .</stage>
   <stage>CONN And why would n't you do it , James Moynihan ? Sure it would be the making of you . It would be sung all over Ireland , and your name to it . Do you hear that , Maire ? Do you hear that , Anne ?</stage>
   <stage>JAMES I 'm saying that I 'd like to do a ballad about your father 's victory .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Maybe you could have it this night week , James ? ANNE Will it be a poem or a ballad , James ?</stage>
   <stage>Anne goes to him .</stage>
   <stage>CONN If you had it this night week , we could bring the boys to the place . What do you say to that , Maire ? We 'll bring the boys here this night week to hear James Moynihan 's ballad .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I was thinking of the Feis at Ardagh .</stage>
   <stage>CONN The Feis at Ardagh ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Maybe you 'll be going to it this night week .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Sure you 're not joking with me , Maire ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE No .</stage>
   <stage>She rises .</stage>
   <stage>CONN God forgive me , Maire , if I vexed you .</stage>
   <stage>Maire goes up to Conn 's room .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Anne , jewel , had Maire anything to say about Ardagh ?</stage>
   <stage>ANNE We were n't talking about that at all .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES Play me a rouse on the fiddle and maybe the ballad will come into my head .</stage>
   <stage>Maire comes down , a fiddle in her hands .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Here 's the fiddle that was your favourite , the Granard fiddle .</stage>
   <stage>CONN And this is the fiddle I 'll bring with me to Ardagh .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE And is he going to Ardagh ?</stage>
   <stage>JAMES And what about the ballad , Mister Hourican ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN I leave it all to Maire now . How well she bethought of the Granard fiddle .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Father , we were always together .</stage>
   <stage>She hands him the fiddle . Conn , Maire , James , Anne , are at table .</stage>
   <p>CURTAIN</p>
   <p>ACT III</p>
   <stage>A week later : The scene is as in previous Acts . The table is near entrance . It is laid for a meal . The time is near sunset . Conn Hourican , Maire Hourican , and James Moynihan are seated at table . Maire Hourican rises . She goes to entrance and remains looking out . Conn and James go on eating .</stage>
   <stage>CONN However it is , I could never play my best in this place . The houses are too scattered , I often think . And it does n't do for the fiddler to remain too long in the one place . The people get too used to him . Virgil made better songs than any man , but if Virgil was sung in the fairs constant , divil much heed would be given to his songs .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES Now , I often thought of that .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Another thing , James Moynihan , Ribbonism and the Land League ruined the country .</stage>
   <stage>Maire goes out .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES But sure we must be doing something for the Cause .</stage>
   <stage>CONN They were all Fenians here when I came into this country first , over twenty years ago .</stage>
   <stage>He rises and goes into room .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES Well , he 's a great man , Conn Hourican . ( James rises and goes to fire . Conn comes out of room , carrying a greatcoat ) How do you think you 'll do at Ardagh ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN I think I 'll do very well at Ardagh , James .</stage>
   <stage>He leaves coat on settle .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES Everything 's ready for the start .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Ay , and it 's near time for going . I 'm playing very well lately , James . It 's the thought of being before people who 'll know music . If I was staying in this place any longer , James , I 'd put my fiddle in the thatch , and leave it there for the birds to pick holes in .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES But wo n't you be back here after the Feis at Ardagh ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN Well , I will , for a while anyway .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES And would you be going off again after a while ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN I 'm thinking that when my daughters are settled I 'll have the years before me . I was reared in a place south of this , and I 'd like to go back there for a while .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES But would n't you come back to us ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN There 's many 's the place in Ireland that I never saw , town and countryside . ( He takes the greatcoat off settle and puts it on him ) Tell me , James Moynihan , is your father satisfied with the settlement that Maire 's making for yourself and Anne ?</stage>
   <stage>JAMES My father is very well satisfied .</stage>
   <stage>CONN ( going towards his room ) And so he ought to be , James Moynihan .</stage>
   <stage>Goes into his room .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES My father had always a great liking for Anne . ( Anne comes out of the other room . James Moynihan goes to her ) May you never think , Anne , that you made the bad choice when you took James Moynihan .</stage>
   <stage>They sit on settle .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Sure I was never fond of any one but yourself .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES And I never cared for any one after I saw you .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE I used to hear that you were fond of another girl .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES I was fond of the girl that used to be in the newspaper shop in the town .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE And used you to talk with her ?</stage>
   <stage>JAMES The elbows were worn out of my coat with leaning on the counter to talk with her . But she married a policeman after that . He was a friend of mine , too . It was me that got him the words and music for “ I 'll hang my harp on a willow tree ” — a song that he was always looking for .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Did you make any songs about the girl ?</stage>
   <stage>JAMES I did not .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Oh , James , I 'm glad of that . I 'm glad you made no songs about her .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES Are you content to marry me in the town of Ardagh , after the Feis , as Maire wishes ?</stage>
   <stage>ANNE It will be strange to be married in Ardagh , away from the people I know .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES It will be lucky getting married after the Feis .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE James , it 's a great trial for a girl to face marriage ; but , James , I 'm very fond of you .</stage>
   <stage>James kisses her .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES I do n't know what to think of them writers who say that the Irish girls have n't the heart for love .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Is Maire outside ?</stage>
   <stage>JAMES She went out .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE It 's a wonder that Brian MacConnell is n't here before this .</stage>
   <stage>Anne rises . Maire comes in .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Is there no one coming here ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE There is no one on the road .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Brian MacConnell is late in coming .</stage>
   <stage>Maire comes up to the fire . Anne stands with her . James goes to entrance , and remains looking out .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I saw Brian yesterday .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE And did you tell him that you were going at the sunset ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I told him we were going in the evening .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Maybe you were distant with Brian ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE He looked like a man that something had happened to . Connor Gilpatrick came up , and then I went away .</stage>
   <stage>Conn Hourican comes out of room . He has left the greatcoat in room . He brings the fiddle with him . Maire and Anne go to the settle . They talk .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES ( to Conn ) What would you think of a row of trees planted before the door ?</stage>
   <stage>Conn leaves fiddle on dresser , and comes to him .</stage>
   <stage>CONN They might be very becoming , James .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES My father was saying that the front looked very bare .</stage>
   <stage>CONN A row of trees , when they 'd grow , would make a great difference .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES That 's what my father was saying .</stage>
   <stage>They talk , Conn leaning on the half-door .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE I 'm glad to be here . It would be very strange for me to be married , and in another house .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I was thinking , Anne , that father and myself ought to stay a while on the road , till you and James get settled here .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE Listen , Maire . James says that he 'll be giving this place back to you after a while . With this start he 'll be able to get a house and land near his father 's place . He has fine schemes for making this place prosperous . James , come here . ( James turns from door ) Come here , James , and talk with Maire .</stage>
   <stage>James comes to girls , leaving Conn looking out . Maire rises .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES I 'll make a path down to the road , and , with a row of trees before the door , the place will be well worth looking at .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE We wo n't know the place after a while .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES We can never forget , Maire , that it is to you that we owe the place and the start in life .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I never looked on the place as my own .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES And now that the land is in Anne 's name , my father will be glad to stock the place .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE You have all our will of the place . Father , speak to James and tell him that he has your will of the place .</stage>
   <stage>CONN ( turning from door ) Indeed you have , James , and we 're overglad to have Anne settled with a steady boy .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES Well , long life to you , Conn ; and may the man of art never want fame nor a friend .</stage>
   <stage>CONN ( going to dresser ) Drink to that , James .</stage>
   <stage>He takes up a bottle and fills two glasses .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES I never touch anything , Conn ; but if Anne wo n't think bad of me , I 'll drink to your prosperity .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE I wo n't be watching you at all . ( She goes to door . To Maire ) I 'm going down the road , and if there 's any one coming here , I 'll let you know .</stage>
   <stage>Anne goes out . James takes the glass from Conn .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES Here 's to the fiddler , first of all . May it be again like in the days of Ireland 's glory , when the men of art had their rights and their dues .</stage>
   <stage>He drinks .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Long life to yourself , James Moynihan . ( Conn drinks ) I know you a long time now , and I know nothing to your discredit . You 're one of the few people here that are to my liking . Well , if I 'm nothing to them , they 're nothing to me . I lived my own life , and I had the gift .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES ( with excitement ) If Anne was here , I 'd drink to her . I must go after Anne . May she never repent of her choice . ( He goes to the door , then turns round ) But sure I 'm forgetting the jewel of them all , yourself , Maire Hourican . Long may you reign in splendour and success , and in the wish of your heart .</stage>
   <stage>James Moynihan goes out . Conn Hourican goes back to the door , and remains looking out . Maire stands at fire .</stage>
   <stage>CONN It 's strange to be looking across that door , and the sun setting for our journey . And now we 're letting the place go out of our hands . Well , Honor Gilroy 's bit of land has been brought to a great many people .</stage>
   <stage>He comes down to dresser . Maire goes up to window , and remains looking out .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Is there any one coming here , Maire ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE There is no one coming . It 's no wonder James 's father thought the place was bare-looking .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Well , the bit of land is going to James , and I was saying that it has been brought to a great many people .</stage>
   <stage>Maire takes paper out , and looks at it .</stage>
   <stage>CONN What paper is that , Maire ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE It 's a paper that I have to put my name to . ( She goes and sits at table ) There 's a pen and ink near your hand on the dresser , and you might give them to me . It 's about giving this place to Anne , and James 's father wants my name on the paper .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Well , is n't James 's father the councillor , with his paper and his signing ? ( He brings pen and ink from dresser , and leaves them on table . Maire makes preparations for writing . Conn lights candle at fire , and brings it over to table ) And does that give the place to Anne for ever ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE It gives it to herself . ( Maire signs the paper with the slowness of one unaccustomed to writing ) It will be a great change for us when we come back to this place .</stage>
   <stage>CONN ( going to chair at fire ) It will be a great change for you and me , no matter what we say .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE And now that James 's father is putting stock on the land , the Moynihans will have great call to the place .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Maire , your father is thinking of taking to the road .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE And how long would you be staying on the roads ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN Ah , what is there to bring me back to this country , Maire ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Sure you 're not thinking of going on the roads altogether ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN The road for the fiddler .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Would you leave the shelter and the settled life ? Would you go on the road by yourself ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN Anne and yourself will be settled , and I 'll have the years before me .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Then you 'd go on the roads by yourself ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN Sure I did it before , Maire .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Ah , but do you not remember the prayers that mother used to say for us to get some shelter ? Do you not remember how proud and glad we were when we come by a place of our own ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN The shelter was for Anne and yourself . What had I to do with it ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE The Moynihans are not the sort to make us feel strangers in the place .</stage>
   <stage>CONN The place was your own , Maire , and you gave it to your sister rather than see her waiting years and years .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I came to give it to her after I saw how hard I was on yourself .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Listen , my jewel , even if the Moynihans had nothing to do with the place , what would Conn Hourican the fiddler be doing in this country ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Ah , there are many you might play to ; there are lots that know about music . There 's Michael Gilpatrick and John Molloy —</stage>
   <stage>CONN And that 's all , Maire . MAIRE You might go to Flynn 's an odd time .</stage>
   <stage>CONN And what do they know about music in Flynn 's ? Young Corney Myles was up there a while ago , and you 'd think , from what the men said , that there was never the like of Corney for playing , and the boy is n't three years at the fiddle ,</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Father , stay here where the shelter is .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Sure , I 'd be getting ould , and staying in the chimney-corner , with no one to talk to me , for you 'd be going to a place of your own , and Anne ? after a while , would have too much to mind .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE The people here are kinder than you think .</stage>
   <stage>CONN But what has Conn Hourican to do with them anyhow ? The very greatest were glad of my playing , and were proud to know me .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I know that , father .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Well , one is always meeting new life upon the roads , and I want to spend the years I have before me going from place to place .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE ( going to him ) If you took to the roads , I 'd think I ought to go with you , for we were always together .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Ah , Maire , there are some that would keep you here .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Do you know who would keep me here ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN Brian MacConnell is very fond of you .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Do you know that , father ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN And I know that you are fond of Brian . ( There is no answer ) That my jewel may have luck and prosperity . ( Goes towards room door , leaving Maire standing there ) I 'll be taking this fiddle , Maire .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Oh , are we going on the roads ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN To Ardagh , Maire .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE To Ardagh .</stage>
   <stage>CONN I 'll go up now , and make ready .</stage>
   <stage>He takes candle off table , and goes back towards room door .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Oh , what do I know about Brian MacConnell , after all ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN Brian is wild , but he is free-handed .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Wild and free-handed ! Are all men like that ? Wild and free-handed ! But that 's not the sort of man I want to look to now .</stage>
   <stage>CONN That 's nothing to Brian 's discredit . MAIRE Ah , what do I know about Brian MacConnell , except that he 's a man of quarrels and broken words ?</stage>
   <stage>Conn holds up his hand warningly . Brian MacConnell comes to door .</stage>
   <stage>CONN ( opening half-door ) You 're welcome , Brian .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN Thank you for the good word , Conn .</stage>
   <stage>He comes in .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE You 're welcome , Brian MacConnell .</stage>
   <stage>CONN ( taking candle off dresser ) I was going up to the room to make ready , but Maire will be glad to speak to you . I knew you would n't let us go without wishing us the luck of the road .</stage>
   <stage>Goes up to room . Maire goes and sits on settle .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Brian MacConnell has come to us again .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN I 'm before you again . Let me tell you what I was doing since I was here last .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE What were you doing , Brian ? Making quarrels , may be ?</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN ( startled ) Why do you say that ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I 'm thinking that you were doing what would become you , Brian MacConnell , with the free hand and the wild heart .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN They were telling you about me ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I know you , Brian MacConnell .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN You do n't know how I care for you , or you could n't talk to me like that . Many 's the time I left the spade in the ground , and went across the bogs and the rushes , to think of you . You come between me and the work I 'd be doing . Ay , and if Heaven opened out before me , you would come between me and Heaven itself .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE It 's easy taking a girl 's heart .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN And I long to have more than walls and a roof to offer you . I 'd have jewels and gold for you . I 'd have ships on the sea for you .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE It 's easy to take a girl 's heart with the words of a song .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN I 'm building a house for you , Maire . I 'm raising it day by day .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE You left me long by myself .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN It 's often I came to see the light in the window .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Brian , my father wants to go back to the roads .</stage>
   <stage>Brian goes and sits by her .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN I know that Conn would like to go back .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE He wants to go on the roads , to go by himself from place to place .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN Maybe he has the right to go .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE He has the right to go . It 's the life of a fiddler to be on the roads .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN But you wo n't go on the roads .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Oh , what am I to do , Brian ?</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN Do you think of me at all , Maire ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Indeed I think of you . Until to-day I 'd neither laugh nor cry but on account of you .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN I 'm building a house , and it will be white and fine , and it 's for you that I 'm building the house .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE You 're going to ask for my promise .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN Give me your promise before you go to Ardagh .</stage>
   <stage>Maire rises .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE If I gave you my promise now , I 'd have great delight in coming back to this place again .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN You wo n't deny me , my jewel of love ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Oh , I 'm very fond of Aughnalee . I feel that I was reared in the place . I 'd like to live all my life in the place .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN And why would you go from it ? MAIRE You might come with us to Ardagh , Brian .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN Your father might stay with us when he 'd be in this country .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE That 's true ; I 'm glad to think on that .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN Give me your promise , Maire .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE We 'll talk on the road . There 's the blackbird . I 'll hear him every evening on the road , and I 'll think I 'm a day nearer home .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN Sure you 'd leave them all to come with me .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Ay , I think I would . ( She takes up a new kerchief , and puts it on her , standing before the mirror ) Do you know where I saw you first , Brian ?</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN Where was it , Maire ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE In a field by the road . You were breaking a horse .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN I was always a good hand with a horse .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE The poor beast was covered with foam and sweat , and at last you made it still . I thought it was grand then .</stage>
   <stage>She sings .</stage>
   <stage>I know where I 'm going , I know who 's going with me , I know who I love , But the dear knows who I 'll marry .</stage>
   <stage>Are your brothers with you , Brian ?</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN Is it building with me ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Building with you ?</stage>
   <stage>She sings .</stage>
   <stage>Some say he 's dark , I say he 's bonny . He 's the flower of the flock , My charming , coaxing Johnny .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN ( with sombre passion ) No . My brothers are not with me . I quarrelled with them all and I am nearly heart broken for what I did .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Ah , Brian MacConnell , I do n't know what to say to you at all .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN You 'll give me your promise , Maire ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Promise . I 've no promise to give to any man .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN Remember that these days past I had only yourself to think on .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE There was never a man but failed me some time . They all leave me to face the world alone .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN You said that I might go with you as far as Ardagh .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE No . You 're not to come . Myself and my father go to Ardagh by ourselves .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN How was I to know that you would take that quarrel to heart ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I thought you were strong , but I see now that you are only a man who forces himself to harsh behaviour . I have my own way to go ; my father wants to go back to the roads , and it 's right that I should be with him , to watch over him .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN What shelter will you have on the road ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I 'll have the quiet of evening , and my own thoughts , and I 'll follow the music ; I 'll laugh and hold up my head again .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN Maire Hourican , would you leave me ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE What can I do for you , Brian MacConnell ?</stage>
   <stage>Brian goes to settle , and puts his hands before his eyes . She goes to him .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN You have thought for your father , and you have no thought for me .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Indeed I have thought for you .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN O Maire , my jewel , do you care for me at all ?</stage>
   <stage>She kisses him .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN Maire !</stage>
   <stage>She rises .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I 'm going to call my father .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN You go to him , and you go from me .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE You are both my care : my father and yourself .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN What will become of me when you go ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Is n't it right , Brian , that I should be with my father on the roads ? Even if I was in your house , I would be thinking that I should watch over him .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN Then it 's good-bye you 'd be saying ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Good-bye , Brian MacConnell .</stage>
   <stage>BRIAN ( at door ) Good-bye , Maire Hourican ; gold and jewels , ships on the sea , may you have them all .</stage>
   <stage>He goes out . With a cry Maire follows him to the door . She stands before door for a minute , then she goes back to table , and throwing herself down , remains with her head buried in her hands . James Moynihan comes in . Maire raises her head , and remains looking before her . James comes to table , and puts flowers beside Maire .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES We gathered them for you , Maire . They 're the woodbine . We were saying that you would be glad of the flower of the road . ( Maire puts her hand on the flowers . James goes to the fire ) Anne remembers a good deal about the road . She minds of the grassy ditches , where the two of you used to catch the young birds .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I mind of them too .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES And the women that used to be with your mother , that used to tell you the stories .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE And the things we used to talk about after a story ! There 's the turn of the road , and who 's waiting for you ? If it 's your sweetheart , what will you say to him ?</stage>
   <stage>JAMES I 'm often taken with the thought of the road ! Going to the fair on a bright morning , I 'd often wish to leave everything aside and follow the road .</stage>
   <stage>A fiddle is heard outside . Conn Hourican comes down , dressed for the road . He has on the greatcoat . He carries fiddle . He puts fiddle on dresser .</stage>
   <stage>CONN What music is that , James ?</stage>
   <stage>JAMES Some of the boys are coming to meet you , and they have a fiddle with them .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Well , now , that 's friendly of the boys .</stage>
   <stage>JAMES I 'll go out now , and let them know that you 're coming . ( He goes to door ) Brian MacConnell turned the other way , and Anne went after him .</stage>
   <stage>He goes out .</stage>
   <stage>CONN ( anxiously ) Why did Brian MacConnell go away ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE We did n't agree ; no , not after all you said .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Maybe we 'll see Brian at Ardagh .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE How would he ever come back when I bid him go from me ?</stage>
   <stage>CONN You bid Brian go from you ! ( He goes to the window ) And there was myself that had the mind to go on the road that I see stretched out before me .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE ( going to him ) You need never come back here .</stage>
   <stage>CONN I 'll come back with yourself .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE I remember the time when we were on the roads . I remember sights we used to see ! Little towns here , and big towns far away , and always the road .</stage>
   <stage>CONN And the lasting kindness of the road !</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE There is no need for you to come back here , father .</stage>
   <stage>CONN And would you follow the road ?</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Go back to the fiddler 's life , and I 'll go back with you . Well see Anne and James at Ardagh , and we 'll be at their marriage . ( She turns round as though to take farewell of the house ) It 's right that this place should go to Anne . The house was n't for you , and it was n't for me either , I begin to think .</stage>
   <stage>Anne comes in .</stage>
   <stage>ANNE ( with a cry ) Maire , you are going on the roads !</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE How do you know that ?</stage>
   <stage>ANNE You bid Brian MacConnell go from you , and where else would you go but on the roads ?</stage>
   <stage>She goes to the settle and throws herself down , her hands before her face . Maire puts cloak on . Conn goes to Anne . He takes her hands from her face and holds them .</stage>
   <stage>CONN Do n't be grieving that we 're going from you , Anne . When you come back here again , your own care will begin . I know that you grieve for Maire going from you , and my own heart is unquiet for her . ( He goes to dresser , takes fiddle and wraps it up . He puts hat on . Maire goes to settle , and sits beside Anne ) Well , here 's Conn Hourican the fiddler going on his travels again . No man knows how his own life will end ; but them who have the gift have to follow the gift . I 'm leaving this house behind me ; and maybe the time will come when I 'll be climbing the hills and seeing this little house with the tears in my eyes . I 'm leaving the land behind me , too ; but what 's land after all against the music that comes from the far , strange places , when the night is on the ground , and the bird in the grass is quiet ?</stage>
   <stage>The fiddle is heard again . Conn Hourican goes to door . Maire embraces Anne again , rises and goes to door . Anne follows slowly . Conn goes out . Maire turns to Anne .</stage>
   <stage>MAIRE Tell Brian MacConnell that when we meet again maybe we can be kinder to each other .</stage>
   <stage>Maire Hourican goes out with Conn. Anne is left standing at the door in the dusk .</stage>

     <stage>The interior of Murtagh Cosgar 's . It is a large flagged kitchen with the entrance on the right . The dresser is below the entrance . There is a large fireplace in the back , and a room door to the left of the fireplace ; the harness-rack is between room door and fireplace . The yard door is on the left . The table is down from the room door . There are benches around fireplace .</stage>
     <stage>It is the afternoon of a May day . Sally Cosgar is kneeling , near the entrance chopping up cabbage-leaves with a kitchen-knife . She is a girl of twenty-five , dark , heavily built , with the expression of a half-awakened creature . She is coarsely dressed , and has a sacking apron . She is quick at work , and rapid and impetuous in speech . She is talking to herself .</stage>
    </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , you may go on grunting , yourself and your litter , it wo n't put me a bit past my own time . You oul ’ black baste of a sow , sure I 'm slaving to you all the spring . We 'll be getting rid of yourself and your litter soon enough , and may the devil get you when we lose you . Cornelius comes to the door . He is a tall young man with a slight stoop . His manners are solemn , and his expression somewhat vacant .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
     <p>Good morrow , Sally . May you have the good of the day .<stage>He comes in</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>impetuously</stage>Ah , God reward you , Cornelius Douras , for coming in . I 'm that busy keeping food to a sow and a litter of pigs that I could n't get beyond the gate to see any one .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
     <p><stage>solemnly</stage>You 're a good girl , Sally . You 're not like some I know . There are girls in this parish who never put hands to a thing till evening , when the boys do be coming in . Then they begin to stir themselves the way they 'll be thought busy and good about a house .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>pleased and beginning to chop again with renewed energy</stage>Oh , it 's true indeed for you , Cornelius . There are girls that be decking themselves , and sporting are themselves all day .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I may say that I come over to your father 's , Murtagh</l>
      <l>Cosgar 's house , this morning , thinking to meet the men .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>What men , Cornelius Douras ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
     <p>Them that are going to meet the landlord 's people with an offer for the land . We 're not buying ourselves , unfortunately , but this is a great day — the day of the redemption , my father calls it — and I 'd like to have some hand in the work if it was only to say a few words to the men .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>It 's a wonder Martin , your father is n't on the one errand with you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
     <p>We came out together , but the priest stopped father and us on the road . Father Bartley wanted his advice , I suppose . Ah , it 's a pity the men wo n't have some one like my father with them ! He was in gaol for the Cause . Besides , he 's a well-discoursed man , and a reading man , and , moreover , a man with a classical knowledge of English , Latin , and the Hibernian vernacular . Martin Douras comes in . He is a man of about sixty , with a refined , scholarly look . His manner is subdued and nervous . He has a stoop , and is clean-shaven .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
     <p>I was just telling Sally here what a great day it is , father .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>Ay , it 's a great day , no matter what our own troubles may be . I should be going home again .<stage>He takes a newspaper out of his pocket , and leaves it on the table</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
     <p>Wait for the men , father .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>Maybe they 'll be here soon . Is Murtagh in , Sally ? Cornelius takes the paper up , and begins to read it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>He 's down at the bottoms , Martin .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>He 's going to Arvach Fair , maybe .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>He is in troth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>I 'll be asking him for a lift . He 'll be going to the Fair when he come back from the lawyer 's , I suppose ? Ay , he 'll be going to-night .<stage>She gathers the chopped cabbage into her apron , and goes to the door</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>at the door</stage>Cornelius . Cornelius puts down the paper , and goes to the door . Sally goes out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>Cornelius ! Cornelius goes to Martin .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>outside</stage>Cornelius , give me a hand with this . Cornelius turns again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>Cornelius , I want to speak to you . Cornelius goes to him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>There is something on my mind , Cornelius .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
     <p>What is it , father ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>It 's about our Ellen . Father Bartley gave me news for her . “ I 've heard of a school that 'll suit Ellen , ” says he . “ It 's in the County Leitrim . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
     <p>If it was in Dublin itself , Ellen is qualified to take it on . And wo n't it be grand to have one of our family teaching in a school ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p><stage>with a sigh</stage>I would n't stand in her way , Cornelius ; I would n't stand in her way . But wo n't it be a poor thing for an old man like me to have no one to discourse with in the long evenings ? For when I 'm talking with you , Cornelius , I feel like a boy who lends back all the marbles he 's won , and plays again , just for the sake of the game .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
     <p>We were in dread of Ellen going to America at one time , and then she went in for the school . Now Matt Cosgar may keep her from the school . Maybe we wo n't have to go further than this house to see Ellen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>I 'm hoping it 'll be like that ; but I 'm in dread that Murtagh Cosgar will never agree to it . He 's a hard man to deal with . Still Murtagh and myself will be on the long road to-night , and we might talk of it . I 'm afeard of Ellen going .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
     <p><stage>at the door</stage>It 's herself that 's coming here , father .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>Maybe she has heard the news and is coming to tell us . Ellen comes in . She has a shawl over her head which she lays aside . She is about twenty-five , slightly built , nervous , emotional .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>Is it only ourselves that 's here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>Only ourselves . Did you get any news to bring you over , Ellen ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>No news . It was the shine of the day that brought me out ; and I was thinking , too , of the girls that are going to America in the morning , and that made me restless . Martin and Cornelius look significantly at each other .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>And did you see Matt , Ellen ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>He was in the field and I coming up ; but I did not wait for him , as I do n't want people to see us together .<stage>Restlessly</stage>I do n't know how I can come into this house , for it 's always like Murtagh Cosgar . There 's nothing of Matt in it at all . If Matt would come away . There are little labourers ’ houses by the side of the road . Many 's the farmer 's son became a labourer for the sake of a woman he cared for !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
     <p>And are you not thinking about the school at all , Ellen ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>I 'll hear about it some time , I suppose .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>You 're right to take it that way , Ellen . School does n't mean scholarship now . Many 's the time I 'm telling Cornelius that a man farming the land , with a few books on his shelf and a few books in his head , has more of the scholar 's life about him than the young fellows who do be teaching in schools and teaching in colleges .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
     <p>That 's all very well , father . School and scholarship is n't the one . But think of the word “ Constantinople ! ” I could leave off herding and digging every time I think on that word !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>Ah , it 's a great word . A word like that would make you think for days . And there are many words like that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>It 's not so much the long words that we 've to learn and teach now . When will you be home , father ? Will Cornelius be with you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Ellen , I have news for you . There is a school in</l>
      <l>Leitrim that Father Bartley can let you have .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>In Leitrim ! Did you tell Matt about it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>I did not . Sally is heard calling “ Cornelius . ” Cornelius goes to the door .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
     <p>Here 's Matt now . The benefit of the day to you , Matt . He stands aside to let Matt enter . Matt Cosgar is a young peasant of about twenty-eight . He is handsome and well-built . He is dressed in a trousers , shirt , and coat , and has a felt hat on . Cornelius goes out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p><stage>going to Ellen</stage>You 're welcome , Ellen . Good morrow , Martin . It 's a great day for the purchase , Martin .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>A great day , indeed , thank God .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>Ah , it 's a great thing to feel the ownership of the land , Martin .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>I do n't doubt but it is .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>Look at the young apple-trees , Ellen . Walking up this morning , I felt as glad of them as a young man would be glad of the sweetheart he saw coming towards him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>Ay , there 's great gladness and shine in the day .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>It seems to trouble you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>It does trouble me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>Why ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>Everything seems to be saying , “ There 's something here , there 's something going . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>Ay , a day like this often makes you feel that way . It 's a great day for the purchase though . How many years ought we to offer , Ellen ? Martin goes out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>Twenty years , I suppose — -<stage>suddenly</stage>Matt !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>What is it , Ellen ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>I have got an offer of a school in the County Leitrim .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>I wish they 'd wait , Ellen . I wish they 'd wait till I had something to offer you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>I 'm a long time waiting here , Matt .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>Sure we 're both young .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>This is summer now . There will be autumn in a month or two . The year will have gone by without bringing me anything .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>He 'll be letting me have my own way soon , my father will .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>Murtagh Cosgar never let a child of his have their own way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>When the land 's bought out , he 'll be easier to deal with .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>When he owns the land , he 'll never let a son of his marry a girl without land or fortune .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>Ellen , Ellen , I 'd lose house and land for you . Sure you know that , Ellen . My brothers and sisters took their freedom . They went from this house and away to the ends of the world . Maybe I do n't differ from them so much . But I 've put my work into the land , and I 'm beginning to know the land . I wo n't lose it , Ellen . Neither will I lose you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>O Matt , what 's the land after all ? Do you ever think of America ? The streets , the shops , the throngs ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>The land is better than that when you come to know it , Ellen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>May be it is .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>I 've set my heart on a new house . Ay and he 'll build one for us when he knows my mind .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>Do you think he 'd build a new house for us , Matt ? I could settle down if we were by ourselves . Maybe it 's true that there are things stirring and we could begin a new life , even here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>We can , Ellen , we can . Hush ! father 's without . Martin Douras and Murtagh Cosgar are heard exchanging greetings . Then Murtagh comes in , Martin behind him . Murtagh Cosgar is about sixty . He is a hard , strong man , seldom-spoken , but with a flow of words and some satirical power . He is still powerful , mentally and physically . He is clean shaven , and wears a sleeved waistcoat , heavy boots , fell hat . He goes towards Ellen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH</speaker>
     <p>Good morrow to you .<stage>Turning to Matt</stage>When I get speaking to that Sally again , she 'll remember what I say . Giving cabbage to the pigs , and all the bad potatoes in the house . And I had to get up in the clouds of the night to turn the cows out of the young meadow . No thought , no care about me . Let you take the harness outside and put a thong where there 's a strain in it . Murtagh goes to the fire . Matt goes to the harness-rack . Martin Douras and Ellen are at the door .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>Ellen , I 'll have news for you when I see you again . I 've made up my mind to that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>Are you going to the fair , father ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>Ay , with Murtagh .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>God be with you , father .<stage>She goes out</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>What purchase are you thinking of offering , Murtagh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>Twenty years .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>It 's fair enough . Oh , it 's a great day for the country , no matter what our own troubles may be . Matt has taken down the harness . He takes some of it up and goes out to yard .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p><stage>with some contempt</stage>It 's a pity you have n't a share in the day after all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>Ay , it 's a pity indeed . Murtagh goes to the door .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p><stage>with suppressed enthusiasm</stage>From this day out we 're planted in the soil .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>Ay , we 're planted in the soil .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>God , it 's a great day . Cornelius comes back .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
     <p>This is a memorial occasion , Murtagh Cosgar , and I wish you the felicitations of it . I met the delegates and I coming in , and I put myself at the head of them . It 's the day of the redemption , Murtagh Cosgar . Murtagh , without speaking , goes up to the room .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
     <p>He 's gone up to get the papers . Father , we must give the men understanding for this business . They must demand the mineral rights . Here they are . Men of Ballykillduff , I greet your entrance . Six men enter discussing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FIRST</speaker>
     <p>MAN We 'll leave it to Murtagh Cosgar . Murtagh Cosgar is n't a grazier or a shopkeeper .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SECOND MAN</speaker>
     <p>It 's the graziers and shopkeepers that are putting a business head on this .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THIRD MAN</speaker>
     <p>If we 're all on the one offer , we can settle it at the lawyer 's .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FOURTH MAN</speaker>
     <p>Sure it 's settled for twenty years on the first-term rents .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FIFTH MAN</speaker>
     <p>There are some here that would let it go as high as twenty-three .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIXTH MAN</speaker>
     <p>What does Murtagh Cosgar say ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SOME OF THE MEN</speaker>
     <p>Well take the word from him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>He mentioned twenty years .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SECOND MAN</speaker>
     <p>Not as a limit , surely ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OTHER MEN</speaker>
     <p>We 're not for any higher offer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SECOND MAN</speaker>
     <p>Well , men , this is all I have to say . If you can get it for twenty , take it , and my blessing with it . But I want to be dealing with the Government , and not with landlords and agents . To have a straight bargain between myself and the Government , I 'd put it up to twenty-three , ay , up to twenty-five years ’ purchase .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THIRD MAN</speaker>
     <p>More power to you , Councillor . There 's some sense in that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIXTH MAN</speaker>
     <p>I 'm with the Councillor .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FIRST MAN</speaker>
     <p>It 's all very well for graziers and shopkeepers to talk , but what about the small farmer ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FOURTH MAN</speaker>
     <p>The small farmer . That 's the man that goes under .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FIFTH MAN</speaker>
     <p><stage>knocking at the table</stage>Murtagh Cosgar ! Murtagh Cosgar !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
     <p>I tell you , men , that Murtagh Cosgar is in agreement with myself . Twenty years , I say , first term , no more . Let my father speak .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>There 's a great deal to be said on both sides , men .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FIRST MAN</speaker>
     <p>Here 's Murtagh now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>Twenty years first term , that 's what I agreed to .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SECOND MAN</speaker>
     <p>And if they do n't rise to that , Murtagh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>Let them wait . We can wait . I wo n't be going with you , men . I had a few words with the agent about the turbary this morning , and maybe you 're better without me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FIRST MAN</speaker>
     <p>All right , Murtagh . We can wait .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FOURTH MAN</speaker>
     <p>We know our own power now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FIFTH MAN</speaker>
     <p>Come on , men .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>If they do n't rise to it , bide a while . We can make a new offer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SECOND MAN</speaker>
     <p>We want to be settled by the Fall .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THIRD MAN</speaker>
     <p>The Councillor is right . We must be settled by the Fall .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SIXTH MAN</speaker>
     <p>A man who 's a farmer only has little sense for a business like this .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SECOND MAN</speaker>
     <p>We 'll make the offer , Murtagh Cosgar , and bide a while . But we must be settled this side of the Fall . We 'll offer twenty years first term .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>Do , and God speed you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
     <p><stage>to the men going out</stage>I told you Murtagh Cosgar and myself are on the one offer . And Murtagh is right again when he says that you can bide your time . But make sure of the mineral rights , men ; make sure of the mineral rights . The men go out ; Cornelius follows them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p><stage>with irony</stage>Musha , but that 's a well-discoursed lad . It must be great to hear the two of you at it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>God be good to Cornelius . There 's little of the world 's harm in the boy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>He and my Sally would make a great match of it . She 's a bright one , too .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>Murtagh Cosgar , have you no feeling for your own flesh and blood ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>Too much feeling , maybe .<stage>He stands at the door in silence . With sudden enthusiasm</stage>Ah , but that 's the sight to fill one 's heart . Lands ploughed and spread . And all our own ; all our own .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>All our own , ay . But we made a hard fight for them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>Ay .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>Them that come after us will never see them as we 're seeing them now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p><stage>turning round</stage>Them that come after us . Is n't that a great thought , Martin Douras ? and is n't it a great thing that we 're able to pass this land on to them , and it redeemed for ever ? Ay , and their manhood spared the shame that our manhood knew . Standing in the rain with our hats off to let a landlord — ay , or a landlord 's dog-boy — pass the way !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p><stage>mournfully</stage>May it be our own generation that will be in it . Ay , but the young are going fast ; the young are going fast .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p><stage>sternly</stage>Some of them are no loss .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Ten of your own children went , Murtagh Cosgar .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>I never think of them . When they went from my control , they went from me altogether . There 's the more for Matt .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p><stage>moistening his mouth , and beginning very nervously</stage>Ay , Matt . Matt 's a good lad .</p>
    </sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p><stage>nervously</stage>Maybe , maybe . But , mind you , Murtagh Cosgar , there are things — little things , mind you . Least , ways , what we call little things . And , after all , who are we to judge whether a thing —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>Is there anything on your mind , Martin Douras ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p><stage>hurriedly</stage>No ; oh , no . I was thinking — I was thinking , maybe you 'd give me a lift towards Arvach , if you 'd be going that way this night .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>Ay , why not ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>And we could talk about the land , and about Matt , too . Would n't it be a heart-break if any of our children went — because of a thing we might —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p><stage>fiercely</stage>What have you to say about Matt ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p><stage>stammering</stage>Nothing except in a — in what you might call a general way . There 's many a young man left house and land for the sake of some woman , Murtagh Cosgar .</p>

I came out of a little house by the roadway and built my house on a hill . I had many children . Coming home in the long evenings , or kneeling still when the prayers would be over , I 'd have my dreams . A son in Aughnalee , a son in Ballybrian , a son in Dunmore , a son of mine with a shop , a son of mine saying Mass in Killnalee . And I have a living name — a name in flesh and blood .</p>

     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>We 're not the one sort , I tell you . Martin Douras , is n't he a foolish old man that would drive all his children from him ? What would his twenty years ’ purchase be to him then ?</p>

     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>It was n't for my children I worked . No , no ; thank God ; it was n't for my children I worked . Go , if you will . I can be alone .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>I do say it again . Them who dared to go had more of my blood in them !</p>

     <p>Ah , you have put me to it now , and I 'm glad , glad . A little house , a bit of land . Do you think they could keep me here ?</p>

     <p>Father ‘ ud keep us all working . He 's a powerful great man .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , he 'd have his way , and she 'd have her way , I suppose .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>And do you think your father will let him marry ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>Sure he must if the boy likes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>What would he say if Matt married a girl without a fortune ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>In my mother 's country there are lots of girls with fortunes that Matt could have .</p>

     <p>Supposing he wanted a girl that had no fortune ?</p>

     <p>You 're a good girl , Sally . If I was Matt 's wife , do you think you 'd be fond of me ?</p>

     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>Who 's coming at all ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
     <p>Some of the boys and girls that are for America . They are going to Gilroy 's to-night , and are leaving from that in the morning . They are coming in to see Ellen on their way down .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>There are a good many going this flight . The land never troubles them in America , and they can wear fine clothes , and be as free as the larks over the bogs . It 's a wonder you never thought of going , Ellen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>Father would n't like me to be far from him , and so I went in for the school instead .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>And now you 've got a fine boy like Matt . It was lucky for you to be staying here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>Hush , Sally .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I knew all about it before you talked to me at all . Matt always goes to the place where he thinks you 'd be .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>rising</stage>I 'll be in the room when the girls come , Cornelius . She goes into room left .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>going to Cornelius</stage>God help us , but she 's the silent creature . Is n't it a wonder she 's not filled with talk of him after seeing him to-day ? But Ellen 's right . We should n't be talking about men , nor thinking about them either ; and that 's the way to keep them on our hands on the long run . I 'll be going myself . She goes towards door .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
     <p><stage>going to her</stage>Do n't be minding Ellen at all , Sally .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>Well , as high as she is , and as mighty as she is , she came into his own house to see Matt . God between us and harm , Cornelius , maybe they 'll be saying I came into your house to see you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
     <p>Who 'll know you came at all ? And what is n't seen wo n't be spoken of .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>Would you like me to stay , Cornelius ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
     <p>Ay , I would .</p>

     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>after a pause</stage>Would you like me to knit you a pair of socks , Cornelius ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I would , Sally ; I 'd love to wear them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>I 'll knit them . We 'll be getting rid of the sow tonight , maybe , and I 'll have time after that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
     <p>And you come along the road when I 'm herding . I do n't want to be going near your father 's house .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>O Cornelius , it wo n't be lucky for us when father hears about</l>
      <l>Ellen and Matt .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
     <p>That 's true . No man sees his house afire but looks to his rick .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>Come down a bit of the road with me , Cornelius . The sow will be grunting and grunting , reminding father that I 'm away . Och , a minute ago I was as contented as if there was no land or pigs , or harsh words to trouble one .<stage>She goes to the door</stage>The boys and girls for America are coming here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
     <p>Give me your hands to hold , Sally .<stage>She gives him her hands</stage>We are as young as any of them after all . They hold each other 's hands , then stand apart .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>It 's a fine time for them to be going when the leaves are opening on the trees . Three boys and three girls enter . They are dressed for going away .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>God save you , girls . Good-bye , Cornelius . I 'll have to run like a redshank .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Sally goes out</speaker>
     <p>CORNELIUS I 'll call Ellen down to you .<stage>He goes to the room door and calls</stage>I 'm going herding myself . Herding is pleasant when you have thoughts with you . He takes up the rod and goes out . The girls begin whispering , then chattering .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FIRST GIRL</speaker>
     <p>Sure I know . Every night I 'm dreaming of the sea and the great towns . Streets and streets of houses and every street as crowded as the road outside the chapel when the people do be coming from Mass . I could watch the crowd in the street ; I would think it better than any sight I ever knew .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SECOND GIRL</speaker>
     <p>And the shops and the great houses .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SECOND BOY</speaker>
     <p>There 's no stir here . There 's no fine clothes , nor fine manners , nor fine things to be seen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THIRD BOY</speaker>
     <p>There 's no money . One could never get a shilling together here . In America there 's money to have and to spend and to send home .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THIRD GIRL</speaker>
     <p>Every girl gets married in America . Ellen comes down .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I 'm glad you came . I have tea ready for you . I can n't go to</l>
      <l>Gilroy 's to-night .</l>
      <l>Some come to the table and some remain near the door .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>A GIRL</speaker>
     <p><stage>at table , to Ellen</stage>They say that a peat fire like that will seem very strange to us after America . Bridget wondered at it when she came back . “ Do civilized people really cook at the like of them ? ” said she .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>A BOY</speaker>
     <p>It 's the little houses with only three rooms in them that will seem strange . I 'm beginning to wonder myself at their thatch and their mud walls .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANOTHER GIRL</speaker>
     <p>Houses in bogs and fields . It was a heart-break trying to keep them as we 'd like to keep them . A GIRL<stage>at door</stage>Ah , but I 'll never forget Gortan and the little road to Aughnalee .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANOTHER GIRL</speaker>
     <p>I think I 'll be lonesome for a long time . I 'll be thinking on my brothers and sisters . I nursed and minded all the little ones .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FIRST BOY</speaker>
     <p>A girl like you , Ellen , is foolish to be staying here .</p>

      <l>She 'll be coming in the fall . We 'll be glad to see you ,</l>
      <l>Ellen .</l>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>I have no friends in America .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FIRST GIRL</speaker>
     <p>I have no friends there , either . But I 'll get on . You could get on better than any of us , Ellen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SECOND GIRL</speaker>
     <p>She 's waiting for her school . It will be a little place by the side of a bog .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THIRD GIRL</speaker>
     <p><stage>going to Ellen</stage>There would be little change in that . And is n't it a life altogether different from this life that we have been longing for ? To be doing other work , and to be meeting strange people . And instead of bare roads and market-towns , to be seeing streets , and crowds , and theaters .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>passionately</stage>O what do you know about streets and theaters ? You have only heard of them . They are finer than anything you could say . They are finer than anything you could think of , after a story , when you 'd be A GIRL You 'll be going after all , Ellen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>I wo n't be going .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FIRST GIRL</speaker>
     <p>Well , maybe you 'll be down at Gilroy 's . We must go now . The girls go to the door . Ellen goes with them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ONE OF THE BOYS</speaker>
     <p>Phil said that an egg was all he could touch while he was on the sea .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SECOND BOY</speaker>
     <p>God help us , if that was all Phil could take .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THIRD BOY</speaker>
     <p>Light your pipes now , and we 'll go . Ellen has parted with the girls . The boys light their pipes at fire . They go to door , and shake hands with Ellen . The boys go out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>Theaters ! What do they know of theaters ? And it 's their like will be enjoying them . Sally comes back . She is more hurried than before .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>Ellen ! Ellen ! I have wonders to tell . Where is Cornelius , at all ? He 's never here when you have wonders to tell .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>What have you to tell ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I do n't know how I 'll get it all out ! Matt and father had an odious falling out , and it was about you . And Matt 's going to America ; and he 's to bring you with him . And Cornelius was saying that if father found out about yourself and Matt —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>Sally , Sally , take breath and tell it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>Matt is going to America , like the others , and he 's taking you with him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>Sally , Sally , is it the truth you 're telling ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>It is the truth . Honest as day , it is the truth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>And I thought I 'd be content with a new house . Now we can go away together . I can see what I longed to see . I have a chance of knowing what is in me .<stage>She takes Sally 's hands</stage>It 's great news you 've brought me . No one ever brought me such news before . Take this little cross . You wo n't have a chance of getting fond of me after all .<stage>She wears a cross at her throat ; she breaks the string , and gives it to Sally</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know why I was so fervent to tell you . There 's the stool before me that myself and Cornelius were sitting on , and he saying —<stage>She goes to the door</stage>Here 's Matt ! Now we 'll hear all about it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>So soon ; so soon .<stage>She goes to the mirror . After a pause , turning to Sally</stage>Go down the road a bit , when he comes in . Sally , you have a simple mind ; you might be saying a prayer that it will be for the best .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>going to the door muttering</stage>Go down the road a bit ! ‘ Deed and I will not till I know the whole ins and outs of it . Sure I 'm as much concerned in it as herself ! “ No man sees his house afire but watches his rick , ” he was saying . Ah , there 's few of them could think of as fine a thing as that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Matt comes in</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>MATT</l>
      <l>Well , Sally , were you home lately ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>I was — leastways as far as the door . Father and oul ’ Martin were discoursing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>I 've given them something to discourse about . Maybe you 'll be treated better from this day . Sally .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>O Matt , I 'm sorry .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>MATT<stage>going to Ellen</stage>It happened at last , Ellen ; the height of the quarrel came .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>It was bound to come . I knew it would come , Matt .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>He was a foolish man to put shame on me after all I did for the land .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>You had too much thought for the land .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>I had in troth . The others went when there was less to be done . They could not stand him . Even the girls stole away .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>There was the high spirit in the whole of you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>I showed it to him . “ Stop , ” said I ; “ no more , or I fling lands and house and everything aside . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>You said that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>Ay . “ Your other children went for less , ” said I ; “ do you think there 's no blood in me at all ? ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>What happened then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>“ I 'm your last son , ” I said ; “ keep your land and your twenty years ’ purchase . I 'm with the others ; and it 's poor your land will leave you , and you without a son to bring down your name . A bit of land , a house , ” said I ; “ do you think these will keep me here ? ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>I knew they could not keep you here , Matt . You have broken from them at last ; and now the world is before us . Think of all that is before us — the sea , and the ships , the strange life , and the great cities .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>Ay — there before us — if we like .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>Surely we like .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>I was always shy of crowds . I 'm simple , after all , Ellen , and have no thought beyond the land .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>You said that house and land could not keep you . You told him you were going as your brothers went .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>And I felt I was going . I frightened him . He 'll be glad to see me back . It will be long before he treats me that way again .</p>

     <p>What is it , Ellen ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know — I was upset — thinking of the quarrel<stage>putting her hands on his shoulders</stage>My poor Matt . It was about me you quarrelled .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>Ay , he spoke against you . I could n't put up with that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>He does not know your high spirit . He does not know your strength .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>Ellen , it 's no shame for a man to have harsh words said to him when it 's about a woman like you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>Let nothing come between us now . I saw you in the winter making drains and ditches , and it wet . It 's a poor story , the life of a man on the land .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>I had too much thought for the land .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>You had . Have thought for me now . There is no one in fair or market but would notice me . I was never a favourite . I lived to myself . I did not give my love about . You have never offered me anything . In the song a man offers towns to his sweetheart . You can offer me the sights of great towns , and the fine manners , and the fine life .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>Ellen !<stage>He draws a little away</stage>It 's not me that could offer the like of that . I never had anything to my hand but a spade .</p>

     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>Your brothers — think of them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>They all left some one behind them . I am the last of my name .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>Why should that keep you back ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>His name is something to a man . Could you hear of your own name melting away without unease ? And you are a woman . A man feels it more .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>I do not understand men . Will you go back to your father 's house after he shaming you out of it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>He 'll be glad to see me back . He 'll never cast it up to me that I went .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>Matt , your father said words against me . Will you go to him and take his hand after that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>It was little he said against you . It was against your father he spoke .</p>

    </sp>

     <p>It 's a bad hand I 'd make of a farmer 's house . I 'm not the sort to be in one . I 'm not like Sally .</p>

     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>with great vehemence</stage>I must be talking like this . If you take me , you will have to go from your father 's house . I always knew it . You ought to know it now , Matt Cosgar .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>You did n't know it always . And you have let some one come between us when you talk like that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>I 'm not one to be listening to what people say about you . Nor do I be talking in the markets about you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>I suppose not . You would n't have people think you gave any thought to me ; I 'm not good enough for you . The people you know are better .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>You are foolish to be talking like that . You are foolish , I say .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>I know I am foolish . Fit only to be working in drains and ditches in the winter . That 's what you think .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>Maybe it is .</p>

     <p>Ellen Douras ! Ellen Douras ! A farmer 's roof will be high enough for you some day .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>May I never see the day . Go back , go back . Make it up with your father . Your father will be glad of a labourer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>Maybe you wo n't be glad if I go back ; thinking on what you 've said .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>I said too much . We do n't know each other at all . Go back . You have made your choice . She goes up to room left .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>Very well , then . God above , am I to be treated everywhere like a heifer strayed into a patch of oats ? Neither man nor woman will make me put up with this any longer .<stage>Going to door</stage>When Ellen Douras wants me , she knows the place to send to .<stage>He stands at door . There is no sound from room . Going back he speaks loudly</stage>I 'll be waiting two days or three days to hear from Ellen Douras . There is no sound . Matt goes out . The room door is thrown open , and Ellen comes down .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p><stage>furiously</stage>Two days or three days he 'll wait for me . As if I 'd go into Murtagh Cosgar 's house . As if I 'd go into any farmer 's house .

     <p>It 's myself used to have the great heart . Driving in on my own side-car , and looking down on the crowd of them . It 's twenty years since I took a sup of drink . Oh , we 'll have drinking to-morrow that will soften the oul ’ skin of you . You 'll be singing songs about the Trojans to charm every baste in the fair .</p>

     <p>I wo n't answer you at all , Murtagh Cosgar . There 's no use in talking to you .</p>

     <p>Ha , here 's one of the clutch home . Well , did you see that brother of yours ?</p>

     <p>I did . He 'll be home soon , father .</p>

     <p>What 's that you say ? Were you talking to him ? Did he say he 'd be home ?</p>

     <p>No , father .</p>

     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>He was coming home . He went round the long way , I 'm thinking . Ellen Douras was vexed with him , father . She is n't going either , Matt says , but I 'm thinking that you might as well try to keep a corncrake in the meadow for a whole winter , as to try to keep Ellen Douras in Aughnalee .</p>

     <p>Sit down near me , and let me hear everything , Sally . Was it Matt that told you , or were you talking to Ellen herself ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>O , indeed , I had a talk with Ellen , but she wo n't give much of her mind away . It was Matt that was telling me . “ Indeed she 's not going , ” said he , “ and a smart young fellow like myself thinking of her . Ellen is too full of notions . ” Here 's Matt himself . Father wo n't have a word to say to him . He 's getting mild as he 's getting ould , and maybe it 's a fortune he 'll be leaving to myself . Matt comes to the door . He enters .</p>

     <p>Where is he ? He 's not gone to the fair so early ?</p>

What good will anything be if Ellen Douras goes ?<stage>He turns to the door , then stops</stage>I came to settle with him . I must n't be running about like a frightened child .

     <p>Be up early , and let the cows along the road , or they 'll be breaking into the young meadow .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>I 'll do that , too .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>Be sure to keep enough fresh milk for the young calf .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>I 'll be sure to do it , father . She goes out . Martin takes out his paper , and begins to read it again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p><stage>turning on Murtag</stage>Before I go out again there 's something I want settled .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>What is it you want ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>Would you have me go , or would you have me stay ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>Do n't be talking of going or staying , and you the last of them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>But I will be talking of it . You must treat me differently if you want me to stay . You must treat me differently to the way you treat Sally .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>You were always treated differently , Matt . In no house that ever I remember was there a boy treated as well as you are treated here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>The houses that you remember are different from the houses that are now . Will you have me go , or will you have me stay ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>You 're very threatening . I 'd have you stay . For the sake of the name , I 'd have you stay .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>Let us take hands on it , then .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>Wait , we 'll see what you want first .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>You have no feeling . I 'd go out of this house , only I want to give you a chance .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>Stop . We can have kindness in this . We need n't be beating each other down , like men at a fair .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>We 're not men at a fair . May God keep the kindness in our hearts .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>Do n't be going yet . I 'll be with you , when you 're going . Martin sits down .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>Maybe I will .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p><stage>bitterly</stage>In the houses that are now , the young marry where they have a mind to . It 's their own business , they say .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>Maybe it is their own business . I 'm going to marry Ellen Douras , if she 'll have me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>Ellen is a good girl , and clever , I 'm told . But I would not have you deal before you go into the fair .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>I 'm going to marry Ellen Douras .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>Her father is here , and we can settle it now . What fortune will you be giving Ellen , Martin ? That 100 pounds that was saved while you were in Maryborough gaol ? Martin shakes his head .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p><stage>stubbornly</stage>I 'm going to marry Ellen Douras , with or without a fortune .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p><stage>passionately</stage>Boy , your father built this house . He got these lands together . He has a right to see that you and your generations are in the way of keeping them together .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>I 'll marry Ellen Douras , with or without a fortune .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>Marry her , then . Marry Ellen Douras .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>Now , Martin , we must n't let an hour pass without going to her .<stage>He takes Martin 's arm , and they go to the door</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>Marry Ellen Douras , I bid you . Break what I have built , scatter what I have put together . That is what all the young will be doing , Ellen Douras comes to the door as Matt and Martin reach it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>Ellen ! She shrinks back .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>It 's my father I came to speak to .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>It 's right that I should speak to you all . Matt Cosgar , I am going from here .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>Ellen , Ellen , do n't be saying that . Do n't be thinking of the few words between us . It 's all over now . Father agrees to us marrying . Speak , father , and let her hear yourself say it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>I can n't go into a farmer 's house .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>You said that out of passion . Do n't keep your mind on it any longer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>It 's true , it 's true . I can n't go into a farmer 's house . This place is strange to me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>How can you talk like that ? I 'm always thinking of you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>I 've stayed here long enough . I want my own way ; I want to know the world .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>If you go , how will I be living , day after day ? The heart will be gone out of me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>You 'll be owning the land , Matt Cosgar .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p><stage>passionately</stage>I 've worked on the land all my days . Do n't talk to me about it now . Ellen goes to Martin . Murtagh goes up to the door , and then turns and speaks .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>Listen to me , Matt Cosgar ; and you listen too , Ellen Douras . It 's a new house you want maybe . This house was built for me and my generations ; but I 'll build a new house for you both . It 's hard for a man to part with his land before the hour of his death ; and it 's hard for a man to break his lands ; but I 'll break them , and give a share of land to you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>You were never friendly to me ; but you have the high spirit , and you deserve a better daughter than I would make . The land and house you offer would be a drag on me .<stage>She goes to the door</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>Ellen , what he offers is nothing , after all ; but I care for you . Sure you wo n't go from me like that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>Oh , can n't you let me go ? I care for you as much as I care for any one . But it 's my freedom I want .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>Then you 're going surely ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELLEN</speaker>
     <p>I am . Good-bye . She goes out , Martin follows her . Matt stands dazed . Murtagh closes the door , then goes and takes Matt 's arm , and brings him down .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>Be a man . We offered her everything , and she went . There 's no knowing what the like of her wants . The men will be in soon , and we 'll drink to the new ownership .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>Oh , what 's the good in talking about that now ? If Ellen was here , we might be talking about it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>To-morrow you and me might go together . Ay , the bog behind the meadow is well drained by this , and we might put the plough over it . There will be a fine , deep soil in it , I 'm thinking . Do n't look that way , Matt , my son .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>When I meet Ellen Douras again , it 's not a farmer 's house I 'll be offering her , nor life in a country place .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>No one could care for you as I care for you . I know the blood between us , and I know the thoughts I had as I saw each of you grow up . Matt moves to the door .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>Where are you going ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>To see the boys that are going away .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>Wait till the fall and I 'll give you money to go and come back . Farrell Kavanagh often goes to America . You could go with him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>I 'll go by myself , unless Ellen Douras comes now . The creamery owes me money for the carting , and I 'll get it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>Then go . Good-bye to you , Matt Cosgar .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MATT</speaker>
     <p>Good-bye to you . He goes out . Murtagh stands , then moves about vaguely</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>The floor swept , the hearth tidied . It 's a queer end to it all . Twenty years I bid them offer . Twenty years , twenty years ! Martin comes back .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>The men will be coming back .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>I suppose they will .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>You 're a queer fellow , Martin Douras . You went to gaol for some meeting .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>Ay .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>Them was the stirring times . I can n't help but think of you in gaol , and by yourself . What brings you back now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Ellen told me to go back . I should say something to</l>
      <l>Matt , I think .</l>

     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>

     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>I 'll go in when the house is quiet . I 'll have a few prayers to be saying this night .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>I 'm going to the fair .</p>

     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>Why wo n't you be going to the fair ? Did n't you ask me for a lift ? You 'll be going with me .</p>
    </sp>

      <l>Douras ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTIN DOURAS</speaker>
     <p>I have nothing to say again it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>Then a match it will be . Sally comes in from yard .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>If you fed that baste on honey , she 'd turn on you . Cabbage I gave her and got into trouble for it , and now she 's gone and trampled the bad potatoes till they 're hardly worth the boiling . I 'll put the bush in the gap when I 'm going out again , father .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>Ay . Is that Cornelius Douras that 's coming up the path ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SALLY</speaker>
     <p>O faith it is . I 'll get him to give me a hand with the trough . Cornelius comes in .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
     <p>Well , Murtagh Cosgar , a great and memorial day is ended . May you live long to enjoy the fruits of it . Twenty years on the first term , and the land is ours and our children 's . I met the men .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>Ours and our children 's , ay . We 've been making a match between yourself and Sally .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
     <p>Between me and Sally ?</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Between Cornelius and myself ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>Ay , shake hands on it now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
     <p>And tell me one thing , Murtagh Cosgar . Is it true that Matt 's going to America , and that Ellen will wait for him for a year at the school ? I met them together , and they told me that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MURTAGH COSGAR</speaker>
     <p>What they say is true , I 'm sure . The land is yours and your children 's .</p>
    </sp>

     <p><stage>wiping her hands in her apron</stage>O Cornelius .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CORNELIUS</speaker>
     <p>Are n't they foolish to be going away like that , father , and we at the mouth of the good times ? The men will be coming in soon , and you might say a few words .<stage>Martin shakes his head</stage>Indeed you might , father ; they 'll expect it of you .<stage>Martin shakes his head . Murtagh and Sally try to restrain him</stage>“ Men of Ballykillduff , ” you might say , “ stay on the land , and you 'll be saved body and soul ; you 'll be saved in the man and in the nation . The nation , men of Ballykillduff , do you ever think of it at all ? Do you ever think of the Irish nation that is waiting all this time to be born ? ” He becomes more excited ; he is seen to be struggling with words .</p>

    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>The Master 's office in Garrisowen Workhouse . It is partly an office , partly a living room . To the right is a door opening on corridor , and in the back , left , a door leading to the Master 's apartments . There is an iron stove down from back and towards right , and a big grandfather 's clock back towards door of apartments . A basket arm chair down from stove , and a wooden chair beside it . There is a desk against wall , left , and an office stool before it . Down from this desk a table on which is a closed desk . On table are books , papers , and files . On a wooden chair beside the arm chair is a heap of newspapers and periodicals . There is a rack beside corridor door , and on rack a shawl , an old coat , a hat , and a bunch of big keys . In the corner , right , is a little cabinet , and on it a small mirror . Above door of apartments a picture of Daniel O'Connell . The grandfather 's clock is ticking audibly . It is 8. 45 p. m . The gas over desk is lighted .</stage>
     <stage>Christy Clarke , a youth of about seventeen , is seated in the armchair reading a periodical . His clothes are threadbare , but brushed and clean . He looks studious , and has intellectual possibilities . The clock ticks on , the boy reads , but with little attention . At the corridor door there is a knocking . Christy Clarke turns slightly . The door opens , and a tall man in the ugly dress of a pauper is seen . The man is Felix Tournour . He carries in a bucket of coal . He performs this action like one who has acquired the habit of work under an overseer . He is an ugly figure in his pauper dress . His scanty beard is coal black . He has a wide mouth and discoloured teeth . His forehead is narrow and bony . He is about forty-five .</stage>

    <sp>
     <speaker>CHRISTY</speaker>
     <p>I suppose , now that you 're in the porter 's lodge , you watch every one that goes up and down the road ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>TOURNOUR</speaker>
     <p>It gratifies me to do so — would you believe that now ?</p>

     <p>Thirty years this spring .</p>

     <speaker>TOURNOUR</speaker>
     <p>Twenty-nine years .</p>

     <speaker>CHRISTY</speaker>
     <p>He 's here thirty years according to the books .</p>

     <p>Thirty years .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TOURNOUR</speaker>
     <p>Twenty-nine years . I was born in the workhouse , and I mind when the Master came in to it . Whist now , here he is , and time for him . He falls into an officious manner . He closes up the stove and puts bucket away . Then he goes over to desk , and , with his foot on the rung of the office stool , he turns the gas on full . Christy Clarke gets out of armchair , and begins to arrange the periodicals that are on wooden chair . The corridor door opens . The man who appears is not the Master , however . He is the blind piper , Myles Gorman , who is dressed in the pauper garb . Myles Gorman is a Gael of the West of Ireland , with a face full of intellectual vigour . He is about sixty , and carries himself with energy . His face is pale and he has a fringe of a white beard . The eye-balls in his head are contracted , but it is evident he has some vestiges of sight . Before the others are aware who he is , he has advanced into the room . He stands there now turning the attentive face of the blind .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GORMAN</speaker>
     <p>Mister Muskerry ! Are you there , Mister Muskerry ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TOURNOUR</speaker>
     <p>What do you want , my oul ’ fellow ?</p>

     <p>You are talking to Felix Tournour .</p>
    </sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHRISTY</speaker>
     <p>Yes<stage>speaking as if to a deaf man</stage>The Master will be going the rounds in a while , and you can speak to him in the ward .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GORMAN I 've a favour to ask the Master , and I do n't want to ask it</speaker>
     <p>before the others .<stage>To Christy</stage>Will the Master be here soon , a vick vig ?<stage>6</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TOURNOUR</speaker>
     <p><stage>taking him by the shoulders</stage>Here , now , come on , this is your way out . He turns Gorman to the door . As he is putting him out Thomas Muskerry enters</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TOURNOUR</speaker>
     <p>This oul ’ fellow came into the office , and I was leading him back into his ward .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>Leave the man alone . Tournour retreats to the stove and takes up the bucket ; after a look behind he goes out and closes the corridor door . Christy Clarke takes the periodicals over to table and sits down . Myles Gorman has been eager and attentive . Thomas Muskerry stands with his back to the stove . He is over sixty . He is a large man , fleshy in face and figure , sanguine and benevolent in disposition . He has the looks and movements of one in authority . His hair is white and long ; his silver beard is trimmed . His clothes are loosely fitting . He wears no overcoat , but has a white knitted muffler round his neck . He has on a black , broad-brimmed hat , and carries a walking-stick .</p>

    </sp>

     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>You should proffer your request when I 'm in the ward . However , I 'm ready to give you my attention .</p>

     <speaker>GORMAN</speaker>
     <p><stage>eagerly</stage>They tell me that to-morrow 's the market-day , and I thought that you might give me a pass , and let me go out about the town .</p>

     <p>We 'll consider it , Gorman .</p>
    </sp>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>We could n't let you out to play your pipes through the town .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GORMAN</speaker>
     <p>I 'm not thinking of the music at all , Master , but to be out in the day and to feel the throng moving about , and to be talking to the men that do be on the roads .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>We 'll consider it , Gorman .<stage>He takes off muffler , and puts it on back of armchair</stage></p>

     <speaker>GORMAN</speaker>
     <p>Well , I 'm very much obliged to your honour . Good night to you , Master .<stage>He passes Muskerry and goes towards the door . Muskerry has been regarding him</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>Tell me this , Gorman , were you always on the roads ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GORMAN</speaker>
     <p>I was driving cattle , and I was dealing in horses . Then I took up with an oul ’ man , and he taught me the pipes . I 'm playing the pipes ever since , and that 's thirty years ago . Well , the eyes began to wither up on me , and now I 've only a stim of sight . I 'm a blinded man from this out , Master .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>GORMAN</speaker>
     <p>Ne'er a chick nor child belonging to me . Ne'er a woman lay by me . I went the road by myself . Will you think of what I asked you , Master ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>I 'll consider it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

      <l>Good night to your honour . Remember my name , Master — Gorman ,</l>

     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>Now , Christy Clarke , I consider that the man gone out is a very exceptional man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHRISTY</speaker>
     <p>Is it Myles Gorman ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Yes . I 'd even say that , considering his station in life ,</l>
      <l>Myles Gorman is a very superior man .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHRISTY</speaker>
     <p>They say he 's not a good musician .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>And maybe he 's not . I consider , however , that there 's great intelligence in his face . He stands before you , and you feel that he has the life of a young colt , and then you 're bound to think that , in spite of the fact that he 's blind and a wanderer , the man has not wasted his life .<stage>Muskerry settles himself in the armchair</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHRISTY</speaker>
     <p>Will you give leave for to-morrow ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>No , Christy , I will not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHRISTY</speaker>
     <p>Why not , Mister Muskerry ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>That man would break bounds and stay away .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHRISTY</speaker>
     <p>Do you think he would ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>He 'd fly off , like the woodquest flying away from the tame pigeons .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHRISTY</speaker>
     <p>He and his brother had a farm between them . His brother was married , and one day the brother told Myles to go to Dublin to see a comrade of his who was sick . Myles was home in a week , and when he came back he found that his brother had sold the place and was gone out of the country .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>CHRISTY</speaker>
     <p>How is that , Mister Muskerry ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>He sent Myles Gorman to his own life . He 's a man who went his own way always ; a man who never had any family nor any affairs ; a man far different from me , Christy Clarke . I was always in the middle of affairs . Then , too , I busied myself about other people . It was for the best , I think ; but that 's finished . On the desk under your hand is a letter , and I want you to bring it to me .</p>

     <p>That 's the letter . It 's the last of its kind . Bring it to me .<stage>Christy Clarke brings over the letter</stage>There comes a turn in the blood and a turn in the mind , Christy . This while back I 've been going out to the country instead of into the town , and coming back here in the evenings I 've seen the workhouse with the big wall around it , and the big gate going into it , and I 've said to myself that Thomas Muskerry ought to be as secure and contented here as if he was in his own castle .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHRISTY</speaker>
     <p>And so you ought , Mister Muskerry .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>Look round at the office , Christy . I 've made it as fit for me as the nest for the wren . I 'll spend a few more years here , and then I 'll go out on pension . I wo n't live in the town , I 've seen a place in the country I 'd like , and the people will be leaving it in a year or two .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHRISTY</speaker>
     <p>Where is it , Mister Muskerry ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <p>And so you 'll go back to your own place ?</p>

He was to have been in here to give me a hand with the abstracts . Christy Clarke , go down to Miss Coghlan 's and get me two novelettes . Bring me up two nice love stories , and be here when I come back . Christy Clarke takes his cap off rack and goes out . Thomas Muskerry puts on his scarf , goes to the rack and takes down the bunch of keys . As he is going out Felix Tournour enters with a bucket of coal . He carries it over to the stove .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>Now , Tournour , sweep up this place . Thomas Muskerry goes out by corridor door . Felix Tournour takes brush from under desk , left , and begins to sweep in the direction of corridor door .</p>

     <p>Sweeping , sweeping ! I 'll run out of the house some day on account of the work I 've to do for Master Thomas Muskerry .<stage>He leans on his brush in front of stove</stage>I know why you 're going for walks in the country , my oul ’ cod . There 's them in town that you 've got enough of . You do n't want to go bail for Madam Daughter , nor for Count Crofton Crilly , your son-in-law , nor for the Masters and Mistresses ; all right , my oul ’ cod-fish . That I may see them laying you out on the flags of Hell .<stage>He puts the brush standing upright , and speaks to it</stage>“ The Devil went out for a ramble at night , Through Garrisowen Union to see every sight . The ould men were dreaming of meat to come near them , And the Devil cocked ears at the words for to hear them . ‘ Twice a year we get meat , ’ said the toothless oul ’ men , ‘ Oh , Lord send the meat wo n't be too tough again . ’ To clear away dishes Mick Fogarty goes , May the Devil burn the nails off his toes . Deep dreaming that night of fast days before , Sagging the walls with the pull of his snore , In his chamber above Thomas Muskerry lay snug , When the Devil this summons roared in his lug — ” The door of the Master 's apartments is opened and Albert Crilly enters . Albert Crilly is a young man , who might be a bank clerk or a medical student . He is something of a dude , but has a certain insight and wit .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>Well , he did n't stick the Crillys for anything .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Albert , you do n't know how these financial things work out . Do you think would his brother settle ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>Settle with whom ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Well ... with any of the ... any of the people that have ... I do n't know . It 's a cursed town . If I had joined the police at your age , I 'd have a pension by this , and I might n't care for any of them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>I wish I had a job and I 'd wait on the pension .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , you 'll be all right . The grandfather is seeing about your job .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>If the grandparent gets me that job I 'll want two new suits at least .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>‘ Pon my soul , Albert , I do n't know what 's to be done .<stage>His mind wanders off</stage>I suppose the abstracts have to go out in the morning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>They have . And damn all the old man has done to them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>The Guardians hear that he 's late in the mornings , Albert , and some of them are beginning to question his fitness to check the stores .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>The old man ought to resign .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>I suppose he ought . I 'm not wishing for his resignation myself , Albert . You know your mother regards it as a settled thing that he should come and live with us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>The mother and Anna are preparing for the event .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>How 's that , Albert ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>Mother has James Scollard in her eye for the new Master .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Right enough ! Scollard would get it , too , and then he would marry Anna .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>That 's the arrangement , I expect .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>It might n't be bad . Scollard might n't want Nancy 's money under that arrangement . Still I do n't like the idea of the old man living in the house .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>The mother would never think of letting him take himself and his pension anywhere else .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>I do n't think she would .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>I would n't be surprised if he did go somewhere else . I hear he often goes up to that cottage in Stradrina .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>What cottage , Albert ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>Briar Cottage . I hear he sits down there , and talks of coming to live in the place .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>warningly</stage>Albert , do n't clap hands behind the bird . Take my word , and say nothing about it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>All right .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>We 'd have no comfort in the house if your mother 's mind was distracted . Mrs. Crilly enters from corridor . She is a woman of forty , dressed in a tailor-made costume . She has searching eyes . There is something of hysteria about her mouth . She has been good-looking .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Good night , Marianne .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY Are you finishing the abstracts , Albert ?</speaker>
     <p>ALBERT I 'm working at them . It 's a good job we did n't leave the old man much latitude for making mistakes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>closing door</stage>He 'll have to resign .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Good God , Marianne .<stage>He rises</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Well . Let him be sent away without a pension . Of course , he can live with us the rest of his life and give us nothing for keeping him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know what 's in your mind at all , Marianne .<stage>He crosses over to the cabinet , opens it , and fills out another glass of whisky</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>Let the old man do what suits himself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>coming back to stove</stage>Do , Marianne . Let him do what suits himself . For the present .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>For pity 's sake put down that glass and listen to what I have to say .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>What 's the matter , Marianne ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>James Scollard came to me to-day , and he told me about the things that are noticed .... The nuns notice them , the Guardians notice them . He misses Mass . He is late on his rounds . He can n't check the stores that are coming into the house . He may get himself into such trouble that he 'll be dismissed with only an apology for a pension , or with no pension at all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know what 's to be done .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>If he could be got to resign now James Scollard would have a good chance of becoming Workhouse Master . He would marry Anna , and we would still have some hand in the affairs of the House .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes . I think that Scollard could make a place for himself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>The old man wo n't be anxious to retire .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Why should n't he retire when his time is up ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>Well , here he is what 's called a potentate . He wo n't care to come down and live over Crilly 's shop .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>And where else would he live in the name of God ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>He wo n't want to live with our crowd .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>What crowd ? The boys can be sent to school , you 'll be on your situation , and Anna will be away .<stage>She seats herself in the armchair</stage>I do n't know what Albert means when he says that the Master would not be content to live with us . It was always settled that he would come to us when his service was over . Albert , who has been going over the books , has met something that surprises him . He draws Crilly to the desk . The two go over the papers , puzzled and excited . Anna Crilly enters from corridor . She is a handsome girl of about nineteen or twenty , with a rich complexion dark hair and eyes . She is well dressed , and wears a cap of dark fur . She stands at the stove , behind her mother , holding her hands over the stove . Mrs. Crilly watches the pair at the desk .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>We can n't think of allowing a pension of fifty pounds a year to go out of our house . Where will we get money to send the boys to school ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>Mother . Grandfather is going to live away from us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Why do you repeat what Albert says ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>I did n't hear Albert say anything .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Then , what are you talking about ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>Grandfather goes to Martin 's cottage nearly every evening , and stays there for hours . They 'll be leaving the place in a year or two , and Grandfather was saying that he would take the cottage when he retired from the Workhouse .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>When did you hear this ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>This evening . Delia Martin told me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>And that 's the reason why he has kept away from us . He goes to strangers , and leaves us in black ignorance of his thought . Crilly and Albert are busy at desk .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Well , damn it all —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>Here 's the voucher .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>God ! I do n't know what 's to be done .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>It 's a matter of fifty tons . Albert turns round deliberately , leaving his father going through the papers in desperate eagerness . Albert takes a cigarette from behind his ear , takes a match-box from his waistcoat pocket , and strikes a light . He goes towards door of apartments . Mrs. Crilly rises .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p><stage>his hand on the handle of door</stage>Well so-long .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Where are you going ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>I 'm leaving you to talk it over with the old man . Mrs. Crilly looks from Albert to Crilly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>The Master has let himself in for something serious , Marianne .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>It 's a matter of fifty pounds . The old man has let the Guardians pay for a hundred tons of coal when only fifty were delivered .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Is that so , Crofton ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>It looks like it , Marianne .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>There were fifty tons of coal already in stores , but the Governor did n't take them into account . That cute boy , James Covey , delivered fifty tons and charged for the hundred . The old man passed on the certificate , and the Guardians paid Covey . They helped him to his passage to America .<stage>He opens door and goes through</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>They will dismiss him — dismiss him without a pension .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>Mother . If he gets the pension first , could they take it back from him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>No . But they could make him pay back the fifty pounds in instalments .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Fifty pounds ! We can n't afford to lose fifty pounds .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>Who would find out about the coal , father ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>The Guardians who take stock .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>And how would they know at this time whether there was a hundred or a hundred and fifty tons there at first ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>The business men amongst them would know . However , there wo n't be an inspection for some time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Suppose grandfather had got his pension and had left the</l>
      <l>Workhouse , who would know about the coal ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>The new Workhouse Master .</p>

     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>I think I 'll stay here and advise the old man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>No . Go away .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>This Nancy girl is looking remarkably well .<stage>He turns to Mrs. Crilly</stage>Well , ma'am , and how are you ? I 've written that letter for that rascally Albert . He leaves his stick on table and goes to desk . Mrs. Crilly watches him . Anna comes to her . Muskerry addresses an envelope with some labour . Mrs. Crilly notices a tress of Anna 's hair falling down . Anna kneels down beside her . She takes off Anna 's cap , settles up the hair , and puts the cap on again . Having addressed the envelope , Muskerry holds up a piece of wax to the gas . He seals the letter then holds it out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>Here 's the letter now , and maybe it 's the last thing I can do for any of ye .</p>

     <p>You are very good . Muskerry goes to them .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>In season and out of season I 've put myself at your service . I can do no more for ye . She takes the letter from him . His resentment is breaking down . He sits on chair beside armchair . He speaks in a reconciling tone .</p>

     <p>I 'll send round a bottle of wine . Perhaps we 'll be in the way of celebrating something for Albert .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Nancy was saying that you might like to stay a few days with us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>Stay a few days ! How could I do that , ma'am ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>You could get somebody to look after the House . James</l>
      <l>Scollard would do it , and you could stay out for a few days .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>Well , indeed , I 'll do no such thing . What put it into your head to ask me this ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Nancy said —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>Let the girl speak for herself . What 's in your mind , woman ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Well , you 're not looking well .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>I 'm as well as ever I was .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Others do not think so .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>I suppose you heard I was late a few mornings . No matter for that . I 'm as well as ever I was . No more talk about it ; I 'm going on with the work .<stage>He rises and goes over to desk</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sorry to say that no one else thinks as well of you as you do yourself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>Well , I 'll hear no more about it , and that 's enough about it . Why is n't Albert Crilly here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Well , he was here , and he is coming back .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>I 'll want him .<stage>He takes up a card left on the desk . He turns round and reads</stage>— “ You have let the Guardians pay for a hundred tons . James Covey delivered only fifty tons of coal . ” Who left this here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>I suppose Albert left it for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY The impudent rascal . How dare he address himself like that</speaker>
     <p>to me ?<stage>He throws card on table</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps he found something out in the books .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>No matter whether he did or not , he 'll have to have respect when he addresses me . Anyway it 's a lie — a damn infernal lie . I was in the stores the other day , and there was eighty tons of coal still there . Certainly twenty tons had been taken out of it . The Provision Check Account will show .<stage>He takes up a book and turns round . He goes back some pages . He lets the book fall . He stands there helpless</stage>I suppose you all are right in your judgment of me . I 'm at my failing time . I 'll have to leave this without pension or prospect . They 'll send me away .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>They had nothing against you before this .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>I was spoken of as the pattern for the officials of Ireland .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>If you resigned now —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>Before this comes out .<stage>He looks for help</stage>Marianne , it would be like the blow to the struck ox if I lost my pension .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>If you managed to get the pension you could pay the</l>
      <l>Guardians back in a lump sum .</l>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>If I resigned now , where would I go to ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>It was always understood that you would stay with us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>No , Marianne .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>You 'll have the place to yourself . The boys will be going to school , and Albert will be away , too . Anna and myself will look after you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>I could stay for a while .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , well , if you have a better place to go —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>Remember what I said , Marianne . I 've worked for you and yours , in season and out of season . There should be no more claims on me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>There are no more claims on you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>I 'm willing to leave in the shop what I put into the shop . Let Anna know that it will come to her from me . I 'll write to the Guardians to-night and I 'll send in my resignation . I venture to think that they 'll know their loss . Mrs. Crilly goes out quietly by corridor door .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p><stage>by himself</stage>And I had made this place as fit for me as the nest for the wren . Was n't he glad to write that card , the impudent rascal , with his tongue in his cheek ? I 'll consider it again . I wo n't leave this place till it fits myself to leave it . Christy Clarice enters by corridor door with papers .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>They want me to resign from this place , Christy .</p>

     <p>You 're thirty years here ! Are n't you , Mister Muskerry ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>Thirty years , thirty years . Ay , Christy , thirty years ; it 's a long time . And I 'm at my failing time . Perhaps I 'm not able to do any more . Day after day there would be troubles here , and I would n't be able to face them . And in the end I might lose my position . I 'm going to write out my resignation .<stage>He goes to the desk and writes . Christy is at table . Muskerry turns round after writing</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>No one that comes here can have the same heart for the poor that I had . I was earning in the year of the famine . I saw able men struggling to get the work that would bring them a handful of Indian meal . And I saw the little children waiting on the roads for relief .<stage>He turns back and goes on with letter . Suddenly a bell in the House begins to toll</stage>What 's that for , Christy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHRISTY</speaker>
     <p>Malachi O'Rourk , the Prince , as they called him , is dead .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>Aye , I gave orders to toll him when he died . He was an estated gentleman , and songs were made about his family . People used to annoy him , but he 's gone from them now . Bring me a little whisky , Christy . Christy goes to Cabinet . Muskerry follows him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHRISTY</speaker>
     <p>There 's none in the bottle , Mister Muskerry .</p>
    </sp>

     <p><stage>bitterly</stage>No , I suppose not . And is that rascal , Albert Crilly , coming back ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHRISTY</speaker>
     <p>He 's coming , Mister Muskerry . I left the novelette on the table . Miss Coghlan says it 's a nice love story . “ The Heart of Angelina , ” it is called .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>I have n't the heart to read . The bell continues to toll . Christy goes to door .</p>

     <speaker>CHRISTY</speaker>
     <p>Good night , Mister Muskerry .</p>

     <speaker>SCOLLARD</speaker>
     <p>This is very bad , Mrs. Crilly . Crofton Crilly comes back from shop . He brings in a glass of whisky . He puts whisky on chimney-piece .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>The bank has taken over three hundred pounds from our account .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Perhaps Scollard —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCOLLARD</speaker>
     <p>What were you saying , Mr. Crilly ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I was just thinking — about a bill you know — If some one would go security for us at the bank —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>Father , what are you saying ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>It 's unnecessary to talk like that . In spite of your foolishness , we still have a balance at the bank .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>My portion comes to me from my grandmother .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCOLLARD</speaker>
     <p>May I ask , Mrs. Crilly , is Miss Crilly 's portion safe ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>It is safe , Mr. Scollard .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCOLLARD</speaker>
     <p>I have been definitely appointed Master of the Union , and I may say that Anna and myself are anxious to marry .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>It need n't be soon , Mr. Scollard .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCOLLARD</speaker>
     <p>After Easter , Mrs. Crilly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>But that 's very soon .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCOLLARD</speaker>
     <p>I am anxious to settle down , Mrs. Crilly . I 'm on my way to a meeting of the Board of Guardians , but before I go I 'd like to have some more information about your loss .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Anna 's portion is not touched , but we could hardly afford to let the money go from us now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCOLLARD</speaker>
     <p>Is that so , Mrs. Crilly ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Three hundred pounds is a very severe loss .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCOLLARD</speaker>
     <p>Very severe , indeed . Still , you understand , Mrs. Crilly , the difficulties of taking such a step as marriage without adequate provision .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Damn it all , man , Marianne and myself married without anything at all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p><stage>bitterly</stage>Anna wo n't be such a fool as her mother .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Well , Scollard has his position , and we helped him to it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCOLLARD</speaker>
     <p>I acknowledge that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>Is n't my portion eighty pounds , mother ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Yes , Anna . But I 'd like to tell Mr. Scollard that it would come as a strain on us to let the money go at once .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCOLLARD</speaker>
     <p>I daresay , Mrs. Crilly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>But , mother , would n't the money be safer with us ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Well , I leave the whole thing in the hands of Mr. Scollard .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCOLLARD</speaker>
     <p>Anna and myself have been talking things over , Mrs. Crilly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>And we do n't want to begin life in a poor way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCOLLARD</speaker>
     <p>We see the advantage of being always solvent , Mrs. Crilly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>James has ambitions , and there 's no reason why he should n't venture for the post of Secretary of the County Council when old Mr. Dobbs retires .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCOLLARD</speaker>
     <p>In a few years , Mrs. Crilly , when I had more official experience and some reputation .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>Then he would have seven or eight hundred a year .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCOLLARD</speaker>
     <p>As I said , a man like myself would want to be in a perfectly solvent position .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>Besides , James has no money of his own .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCOLLARD</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I never had the chance of putting money by — Family calls ,</l>
      <l>Mrs. Crilly .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>And we do n't want to begin life in a poor way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>You wo n't want the whole of the money . I 'll give you forty pounds now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>And forty when the first child is born .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>Oh , father , how can you say such a thing ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCOLLARD</speaker>
     <p>I need only say this . Anna and myself were talking over affairs , and we came to the conclusion it would be best not to start with less than eighty pounds .<stage>He rises</stage>I have to go down to the Board Room now , for there is a meeting of the Guardians .<stage>He goes towards door</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Wo n't you take a glass ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCOLLARD</speaker>
     <p>No , thanks , Mr. Crilly . I never touch stimulants . Good day to you all . He goes out . Crofton Crilly goes after him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Anna , you wo n't be deprived of your money .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>Then what 's the difficulty , mother ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Let half of the money remain with us for a while .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>But , mother , if I do n't get all my money , what security have I that what 's left will be good in six months or a year ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>I 'll watch the money for you , Anna .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>It 's hard to keep a hold on money in a town where business is going down .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Forty pounds will be given to you and forty pounds will be kept safe for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>Forty pounds ! There 's not a small farmer comes into the shop but his daughter has more of a dowry than forty pounds .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Think of all who marry without a dowry at all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>You would n't have me go to James Scollard without a dowry ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Well , you know the way we 're situated . If you insist on getting eighty pounds we 'll have to make an overdraft on the bank , and , in the way business is , I do n't know how we 'll ever recover it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>There wo n't be much left out of eighty pounds when we get what suits us in furniture .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>I could let you have some furniture .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>No , mother . We want to start in a way that is different from this house .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>You 'll want all the money together ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>All of it , mother .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>You 'll have to get it so . But you 're very hard , Anna .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>
     <p>This house would teach any one to look to themselves .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Come upstairs .<stage>Anna goes , left</stage>Three hundred pounds of a loss . Eighty pounds with that . I 'm terrified when I think .<stage>She goes after Anna</stage>Crofton Crilly comes in from shop . He takes glass of whisky from table , and sits down in arm chair .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know what Marianne 's to do at all . She has a shocking lot to contend with . Can anything be got from the old man , I wonder ? Albert Crilly comes in by door , left .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>Well , pa .</p>

     <p>Well , Albert . What 's the news in the town , Albert ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>They say that you 've backed a bill for Covey .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>If your mother hears that kind of talk she 'll be vexed , Albert .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>But did you back the bill ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>For Heaven 's sake , let me alone , Albert . Yes , I backed the bill .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>How much ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>You 'll hear all about it from your mother .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>They say the bill was for three hundred .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>It was three or thereabouts .</p>

     <p>It 's scandalous , really . I expect you 've ruined the business .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>I hate the world and all its works and pomps .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>I believe you 've done for the business . I 'm going away .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Then you 've got the other appointment ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>Temporary clerkship in the Land Department . I wonder would the mother let me have the money for clothes ?</p>
    </sp>

     <p><stage>desperately</stage>Do n't mention it at all to her .</p>

     <p>I have a card from a Dublin tailor in my pocket . If I could pay him for one suit , I could get another on tick .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I tell you not to talk to your mother about money . That fellow ,</l>
      <l>Scollard , has put her out .</l>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>How 's that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Money again . Wants the whole of Anna 's portion down . And Anna 's backing him up , too . I do n't know how your mother can stand it . I do n't like Scollard . Then you wo n't be staying on , Albert , to do the stocktaking in the Workhouse ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>No ; they 'll have to get some one else . I 'm glad to be out of that job .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>I 'm not sorry , Albert .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>The mother would expect me to do something queer in my report .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Between you and me , Albert , women are n't acquainted with the working of affairs , and they expect unusual things to happen . Who will they make stocktaker , now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ALBERT</speaker>
     <p>Young Dobbs , likely . I suppose the whole business about the coal will come out then ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>I suppose it will ; but say nothing about it now , Albert . Let the hare sit .</p>

     <p>What does the old man think about it now ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>He 's very close to himself . I think he has forgotten all about it .</p>

     <p>I would n't say so .</p>

I 'll get that share , and I 'll hoard it up myself . I 'll hoard it up . And the fifty pounds of my pension , I 'll hoard that up , too . Albert comes in from shop .</p>

     <p>Go out of the house . No , stay here . You think I 'm out of the Workhouse . No . That 's not so . I 've claims , great claims , on it still . Not for nothing was I there for thirty years , the pattern for the officials of Ireland .</p>

     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>This minute I 'll go down to the Guardians and make my complaint .<stage>He notices his appearance</stage>I 'm going about all day with my boots unlaced . I 'm falling into bad ways , bad , slovenly ways . And my coat needs brushing , too .<stage>He takes off his coat and goes to window and brushes it</stage>That 's Myles Gorman going back to the Workhouse . I could n't walk with my head held as high as that . In this house I am losing my uprightness . I 'll do more than lace my boots and brush my coat . I 'll go down to the Guardians and I 'll pay them back their fifty pounds . Anna Crilly comes in from left with a bowl of soup .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ANNA</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>What has happened to you ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>Felix Tournour knows about the coal , Marianne . He can disgrace me before the world .</p>

     <p>Wait until we consult Mr. Scollard .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Anna goes out</speaker>
     <p>MUSKERRY No , Marianne . I 'm not going to be a party to this any longer . I 'm going before the Guardians , and I 'll pay them back their fifty pounds .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Fifty pounds . From what place is fifty pounds to come so easily ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>I 'll ask you to give me the fifty pounds , Marianne .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>I 'll do no such thing . Anna is getting married , and she claims her fortune .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Anna getting married . This was kept from me . And who is</l>

     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>To James Scollard .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>To James Scollard . And so Anna is getting married to my successor , James Scollard . My successor . How well I knew there was some such scheme behind shifting me out of the Workhouse . And Anna Crilly was against me all the time . Well , well , well . I 'll remember this .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>

     <p>I 'm going out now to pay back the Guardians the sum due to them from me . I want fifty pounds from you . I claim it , and I have a right to claim it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>We have no money at all . Listen . Crofton Crilly backed a bill for James Covey , and three hundred pounds has been taken from our account .</p>

     <p>Yes . Three hundred pounds .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>He backed a bill for three hundred pounds . And do you think , Marianne Crilly , there can be any luck , in a house where such a thing could happen ? I tell you there is no luck nor grace in your house .<stage>He puts on his hat and goes to cupboard to get his stick . He opens the cupboard . He turns round</stage></p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>The good meat I brought in . There it is on the floor and the cat mangling it . I 'll go out of this house , and I 'll never put foot into it again .</p>

     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Have n't I told you the way I 'm straitened for money ?</p>

     <p>You have still in the bank what would save my name .</p>

     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Do n't be unreasonable . I have to provide for my children .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>Your children . Yes , you have to provide for your children . I provided for them long enough . And now you would take my place , my honour , and my self-respect , and provide for them over again .<stage>He goes out</stage></p>

     <stage>The infirm ward in the Workhouse . Entrance from corridor , right . Forward , left , are three beds with bedding folded upon them . Back , left , is a door leading into Select Ward . This door is closed , and a large key is in lock . Fireplace with a grating around it , left . Back , right , is a window with little leaded panes .</stage>
     <stage>It is noon on a May day , but the light inside the ward is feeble .</stage>
     <stage>Two paupers are seated at fire . One of them , Mickie Cripes , is a man of fifty , stooped and hollow-chested , but with quick blue eyes . The other man , Tom Shanley , is not old , but he looks broken and listless . Myles Gorman , still in pauper dress , is standing before window , an expectant look on his face .</stage>
     <stage>Thomas Muskerry enters from corridor . He wears his own clothes , but he has let them get into disorder . His hair and beard are disordered , and he seems very much broken down . Nevertheless , he looks as if his mind were composed .</stage>

     <speaker>THE OLD MAN</speaker>
     <p><stage>speaking as if thinking aloud</stage>I was at twelve o'clock Mass . Now one o'clock would be a late Mass . I was at Mass at one o'clock . Would n't that be a long time to keep a priest , and he fasting the whole time ?</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>THE OLD MAN</speaker>
     <p>I was at one o'clock Mass in Skibbereen . I know where Skibbereen is well . In the County Cork . Cork is a big county . As big as Dublin and Wicklow . That 's where the people died when there was the hunger .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRIPES</speaker>
     <p>He came before the meeting of the Guardians , and he told them he owed them the whole of his year 's pension . Then he got some sort of a stroke , and he broke down . And the Guardians gave him the Select Ward there for himself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SHANLEY</speaker>
     <p>They did well for him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CRIPES</speaker>
     <p>Why would n't they give him the Select Ward ? It 's right that he 'd get the little room , and not have to make down the pauper 's bed with the rest of us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SHANLEY</speaker>
     <p>He was at the altar to-day , and he stayed in the chapel after Mass .</p>

     <p>Skibbereen ! That 's where the people died when there was the hunger . Men and women without coffins , or even their clothes off . Just buried . Skibbereen I remember well , for I was a whole man then . And the village . For there are people living in it yet . They did n't all die .</p>

I 'd as lieve be there as in a mansion . There 's about half an acre of land to the place , and I 'll do work on the ground from time to time , for it 's a good thing for a man to get the smell of the clay .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>Well , maybe you do right not to live with us , but you ought not to forsake us altogether .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>And what do you mean by forsaking you altogether ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>When you leave the place and do not even turn your step in our direction it 's a sign to all who want to know that you forsake us altogether .</p>

     <p>What do you want me to do ?</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Come up to Cross Street with me , have dinner and spend the night with us . People would have less to talk about if you did that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>We want nothing from you . You know how insecure our business is . When it 's known in the town that you forsake us , everybody will close in on us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>God knows I did everything that a man could do for you and yours . I wo n't forget you . I have n't much life left to me , and I want to live to myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>I know . Sure I lie awake at night , too tired to sleep , and long to get away from the things that are pressing in on me . I know that people are glad of their own way , and glad to live in the way that they like . When I heard the birds stirring I cried to be away in some place where I wo n't hear the thing that 's always knocking at my head . The business has to be minded , and it 's slipping away from us like water . And listen , if my confinement comes on me and I worried as I was last year , nothing can save me . I 'll die , surely .</p>

     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>That would n't do at all . There 's a reason for what I ask . The town must know that you are with us from the time you leave this .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>Will you never be done taking from me ? I want to leave this and go to a place of my own . Muskerry puts his hand to his eyes . When he lowers his hand again Mrs. Crilly lays hers in it . Christy Clarke comes in . Muskerry turns to him . Muskerry has been crying .</p>

     <p>Mrs. Crilly sent her away .</p>

     <p>And why did you do that , ma'am ?</p>
    </sp>

     <p>I wo n't be interfered with , I tell you . From this day out I 'm free of my own life . And now , Christy Clarke , go down stairs and tell the Master , Mr. Scollard , that I want to see him . Christy Clarice goes out .</p>

     <p>Do you tell me that ?</p>

     <p>And what is the meaning of that , ma'am ?</p>

     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>The doctor 's discharge ! He would have given it to me —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>You can n't leave without the doctor 's sanction .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>Out of this house I will go to-day . James Scollard enters .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCOLLARD</speaker>
     <p>I believe you want to see me , Mr. Muskerry .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>I do , Mr. Scollard . I am leaving the house .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCOLLARD</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I will be glad to take up the necessary formalities for you ,</l>
      <l>Mr. Muskerry .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>First of all , has the doctor marked my father off the infirmary list ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCOLLARD</speaker>
     <p>No , Mrs. Crilly . Now that I recall the list , he has not .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>I waited after Mass to-day , and I missed seeing him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>My father was seriously ill only a short time ago , and I do not believe he is in a fit state to leave the infirmary .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCOLLARD</speaker>
     <p>That certainly has to be considered . Without the doctor explicitly sending you down to the body of the house you are hardly under my jurisdiction , Mr. Muskerry .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Mr. Scollard , I ask you to give me leave to go out of the</l>
      <l>Workhouse for a day . You can do this on your own responsibility .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. CRILLY</speaker>
     <p>In the present state of his mind it 's not likely he would return to-night . Then if anything happened him your situation is at stake .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>I 'm not a pauper . I 'll go out of this to-day without leave or license from any of you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCOLLARD</speaker>
     <p>As you know yourself , Mr. Muskerry , it would be as much as my situation is worth to let you depart in that way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MUSKERRY</speaker>
     <p>Well , go I will .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCOLLARD</speaker>
     <p>I cannot permit it , Mr. Muskerry . I say it with the greatest respect .</p>

     <speaker>THE OLD PAUPER</speaker>
     <p>A bright day , and the clay on their faces . That 's what I saw . And we used to be coming from Mass and going to the coursing match . The hare flying and the dogs stretching after her up the hill . Fine dogs and fine men . I saw them all . Christy Clarke comes in . He goes to table for his bag . He sees the figure on the bed , and goes over .</p>

     <p>And is he gone home , too ! And the bees humming and all ! He was the best of them . Each of his brothers could lift up their plough and carry it to the other side of the field . Four of them could clear a fair . But their fields were small and poor , and so they scattered . Mrs. Crilly comes in .</p>
