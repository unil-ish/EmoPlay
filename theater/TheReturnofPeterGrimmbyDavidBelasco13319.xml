    <docTitle><titlePart>The present Editor has had many opportunities of studying the theatre side of David Belasco . He has been privileged to hear expressed , by this Edison of our stage , diverse opinions about plays and players of the past , and about insurgent experiments of the immediate hour . He has always found a man quickly responsive to the best memories of the past , an artist naively childlike in his love of the theatre , shaped by old conventions and modified by new inventions . Belasco is the one individual manager to-day who has a workshop of his own ; he is pre-eminently a creator , whereas his contemporaries , like Charles Frohman , were emphatically manufacturers of goods in the amusement line . Such a man is entitled to deep respect , for the “ carry-on ” spirit with which he holds aloft the banner used by Boucicault , Wallack , Palmer , and Daly . It is wrong to credit him with deafness to innovation , with blindness to new combinations . He is neither of these . It is difficult to find a manager more willing to take infinite pains for effect , with no heed to the cost ; it is impossible to place above him a director more successful in creating atmosphere and in procuring unity of cooperation from his staff . No one , unless it be Winthrop Ames , gives more personal care to a production than David Belasco . Considering that he was reared in the commercial theatre , his position is unique and distinctive . In the years to come , when students enter the Columbia University Dramatic Museum , founded by Professor Brander Matthews , they will be able to judge , from the model of the stage set for “ Peter Grimm , ” exactly how far David Belasco 's much-talked-of realism went ; they will rightly regard it as the high point in accomplishment before the advent of the “ new ” scenery , whose philosophy Belasco understands , but whose artistic spirit he cannot accept . Maybe , by that time , there will be preserved for close examination the manuscripts of Belasco 's plays — models of thoroughness , of managerial foresight . The present Editor had occasion once to go through these typewritten copies ; and there remains impressed on the memory the detailed exposition in “ The Darling of the Gods . ” Here was not only indicated every shade of lighting , but the minute stage business for acting , revealing how wholly the manager gave himself over to the creation of atmosphere . I examined a mass of data — “ boot plots , ” “ light plots , ” “ costume designs . ” Were the play ever published in this form , while it might confuse the general reader , it would enlighten the specialist . It would be a key to realistic stage management , in which Belasco excels . Whether it be his own play , or that of some outsider , with whom , in the final product , Belasco always collaborates , the manuscripts , constituting his producing library , are evidence of his instinctive eye for stage effect . The details in the career of David Belasco are easily accessible . It is most unfortunate that the stupendous record of his life 's accomplishment thus far , which , in two voluminous books , constituted the final labour of the late William Winter , is not more truly reflective of the man and his work . It fails to reproduce the flavour of the dramatic periods through which Belasco passed , in his association with Dion Boucicault as private secretary , in his work with James A. Herne at Baldwin 's Theatre , in San Francisco , in his pioneer realism at the old New York Madison Square Theatre , when the Mallory Brothers were managers , Steele Mackaye was one of the stock dramatists , Henry DeMille was getting ready for collaboration with Belasco , Daniel Frohman was house-manager and Charles Frohman was out on the road , trying his abilities as advance-man for Wallack and Madison Square successes . Winter 's life is orderly and matter-of-fact ; Belasco 's real life has always been melodramatic and colourful .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>His early struggles in<settlement>San Francisco</settlement>, his initial attempts at playwriting , his intercourse with all the big actors of the golden period of the ‘ 60 's — Mr. Belasco has written about them in a series of magazine reminiscences , which , if they are lacking in exact sequence , are measure of his type of mind , of his vivid memory , of his personal opinions . Belasco has reached his position through independence which , in the ‘ 90 's , brought down upon him the relentless antagonism of the Theatrical Trust — a combine of managers that feared the advent of so individualistic a playwright and manager . They feared his ability to do so many things well , and they disliked the way the public supported him . This struggle , tempestuous and prolonged , is in the records . A man who has any supreme , absorbing interest at all is one who thrives on vagaries . Whatever Belasco has touched since his days of apprenticeship in<settlement>San Francisco</settlement>, he has succeeded in imposing upon it what is popularly called “ the Belasco atmosphere . ” Though he had done a staggering amount of work before coming to<settlement>New York</settlement>, and though , when he went to the Lyceum Theatre , he and Henry DeMille won reputation by collaborating in “ The Wife , ” “ Lord Chumley , ” “ The Charity Ball , ” and “ Men and Women , ” he was probably first individualized in the minds of present-day theatregoers when Mrs. Leslie Carter made a sensational swing across stage , holding on to the clapper of a bell in “ The Heart of Maryland . ” Even thus early , he was displaying characteristics for which , in later days , he remained unexcelled . He was helping Bronson Howard to touch up “ Baron Rudolph , ” “ The Banker 's Daughter ” and “ The Young Mrs. Winthrop ; ” he was succeeding with a dramatization of H. Rider Haggard 's “ She , ” where William Gillette had failed in the attempt . “ The Heart of Maryland ” established both Belasco and Mrs. Carter . Then he started on that extravagant period of spectacular drama , which gave to the stage such memorable pictures as “ Du Barry , ” with Mrs. Carter , and “ The Darling of the Gods , ” with Blanche Bates . In such pieces he literally threw away the possibilities of profit , in order to gratify his decorative sense . Out of that time came two distinctive pieces — one , the exquisitely poignant “ Madame Butterfly ” and the other , “ The Girl of the Golden West ” — both giving inspiration to the composer , Puccini , who discovered that a Belasco play was better suited for the purposes of colourful Italian opera than any other American dramas he examined .</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>Counting his western vicissitudes as one period , and the early New York days as a second , one might say that in the third period David Belasco exhibited those excellences and limitations which were thereafter to mark him and shape all his work . There is an Oriental love of colour and effect in all he does ; but there is no monotony about it . “ The Darling of the Gods ” was different from “ The Girl of the Golden West , ” and both were distinct from “ The Rose of the Rancho . ” It is this scenic decorativeness which has enriched many a slim piece , accepted by him for presentation , and such a play has always been given that care and attention which has turned it eventually into a Belasco “ offering . ” None of his collaborators will gainsay this genius of his . John Luther Long 's novel was unerringly dramatized ; Richard Walton Tully , when he left the Belasco fold , imitated the Belasco manner , in “ The Bird of Paradise ” and “ Omar , the Tentmaker . ” And that same ability Belasco possesses to dissect the heart of a romantic piece was carried by him into war drama , and into parlour comedies , and plays of business condition . I doubt whether “ The Auctioneer ” would read well , or , for the matter of that , “ The Music Master ; ” Charles Klein has written more coherent dialogue than is to be found in these early pieces . But they are vivid in mind because of Belasco 's management , and because he saw them fitted to the unique figure of David Warfield .</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>But a Belasco success is furthered by the tremendous public curiosity that follows him in all he does . There is a wizardry about him which fascinates , and makes excellent reading in the press . Long before I saw the three-winged screen upon which it is his custom to sort out and pin up his random notes for a play , it was featured in the press . So were pictures of his “ collection , ” in rooms adjoining his studio — especially his Napoleonic treasures which are a by-product of his Du Barry days . No man of the theatre is more constantly on the job than he . It is said that old John Dee , the famous astrologer whom Queen Elizabeth so often consulted , produced plays when he was a student at<settlement>Cambridge</settlement>University , with stage effects which only one gifted in the secrets of magic could have consummated . Belasco paints with an electric switchboard , until the emotion of his play is unmistakably impressed upon the eye . At a moment 's notice he will root out his proscenium arch , and build a “ frame ” which obliterates the footlights ; at another time he will build an “ apron ” to his stage , not for its historical significance , but merely to give depth and mellowness to such an ecclesiastical picture as Knoblauch 's “ Marie-Odile . ” He has spent whole nights alone in the theatre auditorium with his electrician , “ feeling ” for the “ siesta ” somnolence which carried his audience instantly into the Spanish heat of old California , in “ The Rose of the Rancho ; ” and the moving scenery which took the onlooker from the foot-hills of the Sierras to the cabin of “ The Girl of the Golden West ” was a “ trick ” well worth the experiment .</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>Thus , no manager is more ingenious , more resourceful than David Belasco . But his care for detail is often a danger ; he does not know fully the value of elimination ; the eye of the observer is often worried by the multiplicity of detail , where reticence would have been more quickly effective . This is the Oriental in Belasco . His is a strange blend of realism and decorativeness . “ A young man came to me once , ” he said to me , “ with the manuscript of a new play , which had possibilities in it . But after I had talked with him awhile , I found him preaching the doctrines of the ‘ new ’ art . So I said to him , ‘ My dear sir , here is your manuscript . The first scene calls for a tenement-house set . How would you mount it ? ’ ” He smiled , maybe at the recollection of Gordon Craig 's statements that “ actuality , accuracy of detail , are useless on the stage , ” and that “ all is a matter of proportion and nothing to do with actuality . ”</titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>“ I felt , ” Mr. Belasco continued , “ that the young man would find difficulty in reconciling the nebulous perspectives of Mr. Craig with the squalor of a city block . I said to him , ‘ I have been producing for many years , and I have mounted various plays calling for differing atmospheres . I do n't want to destroy your ideals regarding the ‘ new art ’ , but I want you to realize that a manager has to conform his taste to the material he has in hand . I consider that one of the most truthful sets I have ever had on the stage was the one for the second act of Eugene Walter 's ‘ The Easiest Way ’ . A boarding-house room on the top floor cannot be treated in any other way than as a boarding-house room . And should I take liberties with what we know for a fact exists in<settlement>New York</settlement>, on Seventh Avenue , just off Broadway , then I am a bad producer and do not know my business . I do not say there is no suggestion in realism ; it is unwise to clutter the stage with needless detail . But we cannot idealize a little sordid ice-box where a working girl keeps her miserable supper ; we cannot symbolize a broken jug standing in a wash-basin of loud design . Those are the necessary evils of a boarding-house , and I must be true to them ’ . ” One will have to give Mr. Belasco this credit , that whatever he is , he is it to the bent of his powers . Had he lived in Elizabeth 's day , he would have been an Elizabethan heart and soul . But his habit is formed as a producer , and he conforms the “ new ” art to this habit as completely as Reinhardt Reinhardtized the morality play , “ Everyman , ” or Von Hofmannsthal Teutonized “ Elektra . ”</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>“ The Return of Peter Grimm ” has been chosen for the present collection . It represents a Belasco interest and conviction greater than are to be found in any of his other plays . While there are no specific claims made for the fact that PETER materializes after his death , it is written with plausibility and great care . The psychic phenomena are treated as though real , and our sympathy for PETER when he returns is a human sympathy for the inability of a spirit to get his message across . The theme is not etherealized ; one does not see through a mist dimly . There was not even an attempt , in the stage production of the piece , which occurred at the Belasco Theatre , New York , on October 17 , 1911 , to use the “ trick ” of gauze and queer lights ; there was only one supreme thing done — to make the audience feel that PETER was on a plane far removed from the physical , by the ease and naturalness with which he slipped past objects , looked through people , and was unheeded by those whom he most wanted to influence . The remarkable unity of idea sustained by Mr. Belasco as manager , and by Mr. Warfield as actor , was largely instrumental in making the play a triumph . The playwright did not attempt to create supernatural mood ; he did not resort to natural tricks such as Maeterlinck used in “ L'Intruse , ” or as Mansfield employed in “ Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde . ” He reduced what to us seems , at the present moment , a complicated explanation of a psychic condition to its simple terms , and there was nothing strange to the eye or unusual in the situation . One cannot approach the theme of the psychic without a personal concern . Sardou 's “ Spiritisme ” was the culmination of years of investigation ; the subject was one with which Belasco likewise has had much to do during the past years . It is a privilege to be able to publish “ Peter Grimm . ” Thus far not many of the Belasco plays are available in reading form . “ May Blossom ” and “ Madame Butterfly ” are the only ones . “ Peter Grimm ” has been novelized — in the day , now fortunately past , when a play was novelized in preference to perpetuating its legitimate form . And excerpts from the dialogue have been used . But this is the first time the complete text has appeared and it has been carefully edited by the author himself . In addition to which Mr. Belasco has written the following account of “ Peter 's ” evolution , to be used in this edition . The play , “ The Return of Peter Grimm , ” is an expression in dramatic form of my ideas on a subject which I have pondered over since boyhood : “ Can the dead come back ? ” Peter Grimm did come back . At the same time , I inserted a note in my program to say that I advanced no positive opinion ; that the treatment of the play allowed the audience to believe that it had actually seen Peter , or that he had not been seen but existed merely in the minds of the characters on the stage . Spiritualists from all over the country flocked to see “ The Return of Peter Grimm , ” and I have heard that it gave comfort to many . It was a difficult theme , and more than once I was tempted to give it up . But since it has given relief to those who have loved and lost , it was not written in vain . Victorian Sardou dealt with the same subject , but he did not show the return of the dead ; instead , he delivered a spirit message by means of knocking on a table . His play was not a success , and I was warned by my friends to let the subject alone ; but it is a subject that I never can or never have let alone ; yet I never went to a medium in my life — could not bring myself to do it . My dead must come to me , and have come to me — or so I believe . The return of the dead is the eternal riddle of the living . Although mediums have been exposed since the beginning of time , and so-called “ spiritualism ” has fallen into disrepute over and over again , it emerges triumphantly in spite of charlatans , and once more becomes the theme of the hour .</titlePart></docTitle>

    <p>The subject first interested me when , as a boy , I read a story in which the dead “ foretold dangers to loved ones . ” My mother had “ premonitions ” which were very remarkable , and I was convinced , at the time , that the dead gave these messages to her . She personally could not account for them . I probably owe my life to one of my mother 's premonitions . I was going on a steamboat excursion with my school friends , when my mother had a strong presentiment of danger , and begged me not to go . She gave in to my entreaties , however , much against her will . Just as the boat was about to leave the pier , a vision of her pale face and tear-filled eyes came to me . I heard her voice repeating , “ I wish you would not go , Davy . ” The influence was so strong that I dashed down the gang-plank as it was being pulled in . The boat met with disaster , and many of the children were killed or wounded . These premonitions have also come to me , but I do not believe as I did when a boy that they are warnings from the dead , although I cannot explain them , and they are never wrong ; the message is always very clear . My mother convinced me that the dead come back by coming to me at the time of her death — or so I believe . One night , after a long , hard rehearsal , I went to bed , worn out , and fell into a deep sleep . I was awakened by my mother , who stood in my bedroom and called to me . She seemed to be clothed in white . She repeated my name over and over — the name she called me in my boyhood : “ Davy ! Davy ! ” She told me not to grieve — that she was dying ; that she had to see me . I distinctly saw her and heard her speak .</p>
   </set>
   <titlePage>
    <docImprint>She was in<settlement>San Francisco</settlement>at the time — I , in<settlement>New York</settlement>. After she passed out of the room , I roused my family and told what I had heard and seen . I said : “ My mother is dead . I know she is dead ; ” but I could not convince my family that I had not been dreaming . I was very restless — could not sleep again . The next day ( we were rehearsing “ Zaza ” ) I went out for luncheon during the recess with a member of my company . He was a very absent-minded man , and at the table he took a telegram from his pocket which he said he had forgotten to give me : it announced the death of my mother at the time I had seen her in my room . I am aware that this could be explained as thought transference , accompanied by a dream in which my mother appeared so life-like as to make me believe the dream real . This explanation , however , does not satisfy me . I am sure that I did see her . Other experiences of a kindred nature served to strengthen my belief in the naturalness of what we call the supernatural . I decided to write a play dealing with the return of the dead : so it followed that when I was in need of a new play for David Warfield , I chose this subject . Slight of figure , unworldly , simple in all his ways , Warfield was the very man to bring a message back from the other world . Warfield has always appeared to me as a character out of one of Grimm 's Fairy Tales . He was , to my mind , the one man to impersonate a spirit and make it seem real . So my desire to write a play of the dead , and my belief in Warfield 's artistry culminated in “ The Return of Peter Grimm . ” The subject was very difficult , and the greatest problem confronting me was to preserve the illusion of a spirit while actually using a living person . The apparition of the ghost in “ Hamlet ” and in “ Macbeth , ” the spirits who return to haunt Richard III , and other ghosts of the theatre convinced me that green lights and dark stages with spot-lights would not give the illusion necessary to this play . All other spirits have been visible to someone on the stage , but PETER was visible to none , save the dog ( who wagged his tail as his master returned from the next world ) and to Frederik , the nephew , who was to see him but for a second . PETER was to be in the same room with the members of the household , and to come into close contact with them . They were to feel his influence without seeing him . He was to move among them , even appear to touch them , but they were to look past him or above him — never into his face . He must , of course , be visible to the audience . My problem , then , was to reveal a dead man worrying about his earthly home , trying to enlist the aid of anybody — everybody — to take his message . Certainly no writer ever chose a more difficult task ; I must say that I was often very much discouraged , but something held me to the work in spite of myself . The choice of an occupation for my leading character was very limited . I gave PETER various trades and professions , none of which seemed to suit the part , until I made him a quaint old Dutchman , a nursery-man who loved his garden and perennials — the flowers that pass away and return season after season . This gave a clue to his character ; gave him the right to found his belief in immortality on the lessons learned in his garden . “ God does not send us strange flowers every year , When the warm winds blow o'er the pleasant places , The same fair flowers lift up the same fair faces . The violet is here ... It all comes back , the odour , grace and hue , ... it IS the THING WE KNEW . So after the death winter it shall be , ” etc .</docImprint>
   </titlePage>
   <set>
    <p>Against a background of budding trees , I placed the action of the play in the month of April ; April with its swift transitions from bright sunlight to the darkness of passing clouds and showers . April weather furnished a natural reason for raising and lowering the lights — that the dead could come and go at will , seen or unseen . The passing rain-storms blended with the tears of those weeping for their loved ones . A man who comes back must not have a commonplace name — a name suggestive of comedy — and I think I must have read over every Dutch name that ever came out of Holland before I selected the name of “ Peter Grimm . ” It was chosen because it suggested ( to me ) a stubborn old man with a sense of justice — whose spirit would return to right a wrong and adjust his household affairs . The stage setting was evolved after extreme care and thought . It was a mingling of the past and present . It was Peter 's sitting-room , with a mixture of furniture and family portraits and knick-knacks , each with an association of its own . It was such a room as would be dear to all old-fashioned , home-loving people — unlike a room of the present , from which every memento of parents and grand-parents would be banished in favour of strictly modern or antique formal furniture . In this room , the things of Peter 's father mingled with those of Peter 's boyhood and young manhood . This was done in order that the influence of his familiar belongings might be felt by the people of the play . When his niece stood with her hand on his chair ; when she saw the lilies he loved ; when she touched his pipe , or any of the familiar objects dear to her because of their associations , PETER was brought vividly back to her mind , although she could not see him . Peter 's clothing was selected with unusual care so that it would not catch the reflection from the lights . Months of preparation and weeks of rehearsal were necessary . One detail that was especially absorbing was the matter of lighting ; catching the high lights and shadows . This was the first time the “ bridge of lights ” was used on any stage . Lighting has always been to me more than mere illumination . It is a revelation of the heart and soul of the story . It points the way . Lights should be to the play what the musical accompaniment is to the singer . A wordless story could be told by lights . Lights should be mixed as a painter mixes his colours — a bit of pink here , of blue there ; a touch of red , a lavender or a deep purple , with shadows intervening to give the desired effect . Instead of throwing a mysterious light upon the figure of Peter , I decided to reverse the process and put no lights on him . The light was on the other people — the people still in life , with just enough amber to give them colour . The play was cut and cut until there was not a superfluous line in it . Every word was necessary , although it might not have seemed so when read . It was only after the play was recalled as a whole , that the necessity for everything could be seen . The coming of the circus with the clown singing “ Uncle Rat has come to town , ” and the noise of the drums , are instances of this . It seemed like halting the action to bring in a country circus procession , but its necessity is shown in the final scene when the little boy , William , passes away . It is always cruel to see a child die on the stage . The purpose of the coming of the circus was to provide a pleasant memory for the child to recall as his mind wandered away from earth , and to have his death a happy one . This was made more effective when Peter took up the refrain of the song as though he knew what was passing in the dying boy 's mind , showing that the dead have their own world and their own understanding . No company of players ever had situations so fraught with danger of failure . They were very nervous . Mr. Warfield appeared in the part for several weeks before he felt at ease as the living man who returns as his own spirit . There is one memory associated with the play which will remain in my heart as long as it beats . This piece was written during the last year-and-a-half of my daughter Augusta 's life . For some reason , which I could not understand then , but which was clear to me later , the subject fascinated her . She showed the greatest interest in it . The dear child was preparing to leave the world , but we did not know it . When the manuscript was finished , she kept it by her side , and , notwithstanding her illness , saw the dress rehearsal . During the writing of the play , she often said , “ Yes , father , it is all true . I believe every word of it . ” It was as though the thought embodied in the play gave her comfort . When we discovered how ill she was , I took her to Asheville , North Carolina , thinking the climate would help her . She grew worse . Still hoping , we went to Colorado , and there I lost her . It has seemed to me since that the inspiration compelling me to go on with “ Peter Grimm , ” in spite of its difficulties , came from this daughter who died . I cannot close this reminiscence of “ The Return of Peter Grimm ” without acknowledging the help and inspiration received from David Warfield , without whose genius and personality the play would not have been possible .</p>

   <titlePage>
    <docImprint>I doubt whether Mr. Belasco has ever infused so much imaginative ingenuity into the structure and picture of a play . Even in the reading , its quaint charm is instantly revealed . We quite agree with Winter in saying that the effectiveness of the role of PETER lies in its simplicity . This was the triumph of Warfield 's interpretation . It may have been difficult to attain the desired effects , but once reached , technical skill did the rest . It will be noted on the program that credit is given for an idea to Mr. Cecil DeMille , son of Mr. Belasco 's former collaborator . “ The Return of Peter Grimm ” was scheduled for production in<settlement>London</settlement>by Sir Herbert Tree , but plans were cut short by that actor 's sudden death , July 2 ,<date>1917</date>. Mr. Belasco 's interest in the psychic and the supernatural has been seen in other plays , notably in “ The Case of Becky , ” by Edward Locke , and in Henry Bernstein 's “ The Secret ” — example of Belasco 's most skilled adaptation from the French , though we remember the excellence of his version of Berton and Simon 's “ Zaza . ” That he thought Warfield admirably suited to this type of play was one of the chief incentives which prompted him to write “ Van Der Decken ” ( produced on the road , December 12 ,<date>1915</date>) , a play whose theme is “ The Flying Dutchman ” — and not thus far given in<settlement>New York</settlement>.

    <docImprint>NOTE — Mr. Belasco does not intend to advance any theory as to the probability of the return of the main character of this play . For the many , it may be said that he could exist only in the minds of the characters grouped about him — in their subconscious memories . For the few , his presence will embody the theory of the survival of persistent personal energy . This character has , so far as possible , been treated to accord with either thought . The initial idea of the play was first suggested as a dramatic possibility by Mr. Cecil DeMille , to whom Mr. Belasco acknowledges his indebtedness . A conversation with Professor James , of Harvard , and the works of Professor Hyslop of the American branch of the<settlement>London</settlement>Society of Psychical Research have also aided Mr. Belasco .

    <head type="act">ACT I .</head>
    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>The scene shows a comfortable living-room in an old house . The furniture was brought to America by PETER GRIMM 'S ancestors . The GRIMMS were , for the most part , frugal people , but two or three fine paintings have been inherited by PETER .</stage>
     <stage>A small , old-fashioned piano stands near the open window , a few comfortable chairs , a desk with a hanging lamp above it , and an arm-chair in front of it , a quaint old fireplace , a Dutch wall clock with weights , a sofa , a hat-rack , and mahogany flower-pot holders , are set about the room ; but the most treasured possession is a large family Bible lying on a table . A door leads to a small office occupied by PETER 'S secretary .</stage>
     <stage>Stairs lead to the sleeping-rooms above . Through the window , hothouses , beds of tulips , and other flowers , shrubs and trees are seen . “ Peter Grimm 's Botanic Gardens ” supply seeds , plants , shrubbery and trees to the wholesale , as well as retail trade , and the view suggests the importance of the industry . An old Dutch windmill , erected by a Colonial ancestor , gives a quaint touch , to the picture . Although PETER GRIMM is a very wealthy man , he lives as simply as his ancestors .</stage>
     <stage>As the curtain is raised , the room is empty ; but CATHERINE is heard singing in the dining-room . JAMES HARTMAN , PETER 'S secretary , opens his door to listen , a small bundle of letters in his hand . He is a well set up young man , rather blunt in his manner , and a trifle careless in his dress . After a pause , he goes back into the office , leaving the door ajar . Presently CATHERINE enters . In spite of her youth and girlish appearance , she is a good , thrifty housekeeper . She wears a simple summer gown , and carries a bunch of gay tulips and an old silver pitcher , from which she presently pours water into the Harlequin Delft vase on PETER GRIMM 'S desk . She peeps into the office , retreating , with a smile on her lips , as JAMES appears .</stage>
    </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>Did I disturb you , James ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p><stage>On the threshold .</stage>No indeed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>Do you like your new work ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>Anything to get back to the gardens , Catherine . I 've always done outside work and I prefer it ; but I would shovel dirt rather than work for any one else .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Amused .</stage>James !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>It 's true . When the train reached the Junction , and a boy presented the passengers with the usual flower and the “ compliments of Peter Grimm ” — it took me back to the time when that was my job ; and when I saw the old sign , “ Grimm 's Botanic Gardens and Nurseries ” — I wanted to jump off the train and run through the grounds . It seemed as though every tulip called “ hello ” to me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>Too bad you left college ! You had only one more year .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>Poor father ! He 's very much disappointed . Father has worked in the dirt in overalls — a gardener — all his life ; and , of course , he over-estimates an education . He 's far more intelligent than most of our college professors .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>I understand why you came back . You simply must live where things grow , must n't you , James ? So must I . Have you seen our orchids ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>Orchids are pretty ; but they 're doing wonderful things with potatoes these days . I 'd rather improve the breed of a squash than to have an orchid named after me . Wonderful discovery of Luther Burbank 's — creating an edible cactus . Sometimes I feel bitter thinking what I might have done with vegetables , when I was wasting time studying Greek .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Changing suddenly .</stage>
      <l>James : why do n't you try to please Uncle</l>
      <l>Peter Grimm ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>I do ; but he is always asking my opinion , and when I give it , he blows up .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coaxingly .</stage>Do n't be quite so blunt . Try to be like one of the family .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>I 'm afraid I shall never be like one of this family .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>Why not ? I 'm no relation at all ; and yet —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Making a resolution .</stage>I 'll do my best to agree with him .<stage>Offering his hand .</stage><stage>They shake hands .</stage>It 's a promise .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>Thank you , James .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Still holding her hand .</stage>It 's good to be back , Catherine . It 's good to see you again . He is still holding her hand when FREDERIK GRIMM enters . He is the son of PETER 'S dead sister , and has been educated by PETER to carry on his work . He is a graduate of Amsterdam College , Holland , and , in appearance and manner , suggests the foreign student . He has managed to pull through college creditably , making a specialty of botany . PETER has given him the usual trip through Europe , and FREDERIK has come to his rich uncle to settle down and learn his business . He has been an inmate of the household for a few months . He poses as a most industrious young man , but is , at heart , a shirker .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>Where 's Uncle ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>Good-morning , Frederik . Your uncle 's watching father spray the plum trees . The black knot 's after them again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>I can hardly keep my eyes open . Uncle wakes me up every morning at five — creaking down the old stairs .<stage>Eyeing CATHERINE admiringly .</stage><stage>CATHERINE edges away and runs upstairs to her room .</stage>You 're looking uncommonly pretty this morning , Kitty .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>Hartman !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>Yes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>Miss Catherine and you and I are no longer children — our positions are altered — please remember that . I 'm no longer a student home for the holidays from Amsterdam College . I 'm here to learn the business which I am expected to carry on . Miss Catherine is a young lady now , and my uncle looks upon her as his daughter . You are here as my uncle 's secretary . That 's how we three stand in this house . Do n't call me “ Frederik , ” and hereafter be good enough to say , “ Miss Grimm . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Amiably .</stage>Very well .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>James : there 's a good opportunity for a young man like you in our Florida house . I think that if I spoke for you —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>Why do you wish to ship me off to Florida ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>I do n't understand you , Hartman . I do n't wish to ship you off . I am merely thinking of your future . You seem to have changed since —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p><stage>JAMES has laid some mail on the desk , and is about to leave the room , when FREDERIK speaks again , but in a more friendly manner .</stage>We 've all grown up , as you just said .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>The old man 's aging ; do you notice it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>Your uncle 's mellowing , yes ; but that 's only to be expected . He 's changing foliage with the years .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>He 's growing as old-fashioned as his hats . In my opinion , this would be the time to sell .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Astonished .</stage>Sell ? Sell a business that has been in his family for — why , it 's his religion !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>It 's at the height of its prosperity . It would sell like that !</l>
      <stage>Snapping his fingers .</stage>
      <l>What was the last offer the old man refused from</l>
      <l>Hicks , of Rochester , Jim ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Noticing the sudden friendliness — looking at FREDERIK , half-amused , half-disgusted .</stage>Ca n't repeat correspondence , Mr. Grimm .<stage>Amazed .</stage>Good heavens ! You surprise me ! Would you sell your great , great grandfather ? I learned to read by studying his obituary out in the peach orchard : “ Johann Grimm , of Holland , an upright settler . ” There is n't a day your uncle does n't tell me that you are to carry on the work .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>So I am , but it 's not my religion .<stage>Sarcastically ..</stage>Every man can n't be blessed like you with the soul of a market gardener — a peddler of turnips .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Thinking — ignoring FREDERIK .</stage>He 's a great old man — your uncle . It 's a big name — Grimm — Peter Grimm . The old man knows his business — he certainly knows his business .<stage>Changing .</stage>God ! It 's an awful thought that a man must die and carry all that knowledge of orchids to the grave ! I wonder if it does n't all count somewhere .... I must attend to the mail . PETER GRIMM enters from the gardens . He is a well-preserved man of sixty , very simple and plain in his ways . He has not changed his style of dress in the past thirty years . His clothing , collar , tie , hat and shoes are all old-fashioned . He is an estimable man , scrupulously honest , gentle and sympathetic ; but occasionally he shows a flash of Dutch stubbornness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>I ran over from the office , Uncle Peter , to make a suggestion .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Yes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>I suggest that we insert a full-page cut of your new tulip in our mid-summer floral almanac .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Who has hung up his hat on his own particular peg , affably assenting .</stage>A good idea !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>The public is expecting it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>You think so , my boy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>Why , Uncle , you 've no idea of the stir this tulip has created . People stop me in the street to speak of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Well , well , you surprise me . I did n't think it so extraordinary .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>I 've had a busy morning , sir , in the packing house .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>That 's good . I 'm glad to see you taking hold of things , Fritz .<stage>Humourously , touching FREDERIK affectionately on the shoulder .</stage>We must n't waste time ; for that 's the stuff life 's made of .<stage>Seriously .</stage>It 's a great comfort to me , Frederik , to know that when I 'm in my little private room with James , or when I 've slipped out to the hothouses ,— you are representing me in the offices — young Mr. Grimm .... James , are you ready for me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>I 'll attend to the mail in a moment .<stage>Missing CATHERINE , he calls according to the household signal .</stage>Ou — oo !<stage>He is answered by CATHERINE , who immediately appears from her room , and comes running downstairs .</stage>Catherine , I have news for you . I 've named the new rose after you : “ Katie — a hardy bloomer . ” It 's as red as the ribbon in your hair .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>Thank you , Uncle Peter , thank you very much . And now you must have your cup of coffee .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>What a fine little housewife ! A busy girl about the house , eh ,</l>
      <l>Fritz ? Is there anything you need to-day , Katie ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>No , Uncle Peter , I have everything I need , thank you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Not everything ,— not everything , my dear .<stage>Smiling at FREDERIK . JAMES , ignored , is standing in the background .</stage>Wait ! Wait till I give you a husband . I have my plans .<stage>Looking from FREDERIK to CATHERINE .</stage>People do n't always know what I 'm doing , but I 'm a great man for planning . Come , Katie , tell me , on this fine spring morning , what sort of husband would you prefer ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Annoyed ,— with girlish impatience .</stage>You 're always speaking of weddings , Uncle Peter . I do n't know what 's come over you of late .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>It 's nesting time , ... spring weddings are in the air ; besides , my grandmother 's linen-chest upstairs must be used again for you<stage>Impulsively drawing CATHERINE to him .</stage>, my house fairy .<stage>Kisses her .</stage>There , I must n't tease her . But I leave it to Fritz if I do n't owe her a fine husband — this girl of mine . Look what she has done for me !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>Done for you ? I do you the great favour to let you do everything for me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Ah , but who lays out my linen ? Who puts flowers on my desk every day ? Who gets up at dawn to eat breakfast with me ? Who sees that I have my second cup of coffee ? But better than all that — who brings youth into my old house ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>That 's not much — youth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>No ? We 'll leave it to Fritz .<stage>FREDERIK , amused , listens in silence .</stage>What should I be now — a rough old fellow — a bachelor — without youth in my house , eh ? God knows ! Katie has softened me towards all the ladies — er — mellowed me as time has mellowed my old pictures .<stage>Points to pictures .</stage>And I was growing hard — hard and fussy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Laughing .</stage>Ah , Uncle Peter , have I made you take a liking to all the rest of the ladies ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Yes . It 's just as it is when you have a pet : you like all that breed . You can only see your kind of kitten .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coming down a step , impressed by PETER 'S remark — speaking earnestly .</stage>That 's so , sir .<stage>The others are surprised .</stage>I had n't thought of it in that way , but it 's true . You study a girl for the first time , and presently you notice the same little traits in every one of them . It makes you feel differently towards all the rest .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Amused .</stage>Why , James , what do you know about girls ? “ Bachelor ” is stamped all over you — you 're positively labelled .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Good-naturedly .</stage><stage>Goes back to the office .</stage>Perhaps .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Poor James ! What a life before him ! When a bachelor wants to order a three-rib roast , who 's to eat it ? I never had a proper roast until Katie and Frederik came to make up my family ;<stage>Rubbing his hands .</stage>but the roasts are not big enough .<stage>Giving FREDERIK a knowing look .</stage>We must find a husband .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>You promised not to —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>I want to see a long , long table with plenty of young people .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>I 'll leave the room , Uncle .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>With myself at the head , carving , carving , carving , watching the plates come back , and back , and back .<stage>As she is about to go .</stage>There , there , not another word of this to-day . The ‘ phone rings . JAMES re-enters and answers it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>Hello !<stage>Turns .</stage>Rochester asks for Mr. Peter Grimm to the ‘ phone . Another message from Hicks ’ greenhouses .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Ask them to excuse me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Bluntly .</stage>You 'll have to excuse him .<stage>Listens .</stage>No , no , the gardens are not in the market . You 're only wasting your time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>JAMES listens at ‘ phone .</stage>Tc ! Tc ! James ! Ca n't you say it politely ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p><stage>Aside to PETER .</stage>James is so painfully blunt .<stage>Then changing .</stage>Is it — er — a good offer ? Is Hicks willing to make it worth while ?<stage>Catching his uncle 's astonished eye — apologetically .</stage>Of course , I know you would n't think of —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>I should say not ! My home ? An offer ? Our gardens ? I should say not !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>Mere curiosity on my part , that 's all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Of course , I understand . Sell out ? No indeed . We are thinking of the next generation .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>Certainly , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>We 're the last of the family . The business — that 's Peter Grimm . It will soon be Frederik Grimm . The love for the old gardens is in our blood .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p><stage>Lays a fond hand on PETER 'S shoulder .</stage>It is , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Struck .</stage>I have an idea . We 'll print the family history in our new floral almanac .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p><stage>Suppressing a yawn .</stage>Yes , yes , a very good idea .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>

    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Free ? Of course Katie 's free — to a certain extent . Do you mean to tell me that any young girl should be freer ? Nonsense ! She should be happy that I am here to think for her — I ! We must think for people who can n't think for themselves ; and a young girl can n't .<stage>Signing an answer to a letter after hastily glancing over it .</stage>You have extraordinary ideas , James .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>Excuse me , sir ; you asked my opinion . I only meant that we can n't think for others — any more than we can eat or sleep for them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>As though accepting the explanation .</stage>Oh ... I see what you mean .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Giving PETER another letter to sign .</stage>Of course , every happy being is bound by its nature to lead its own life — that it may be a free being . Evidently I did n't make my meaning clear .</p>

     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Free ? Happy ? James , you talk like an anarchist ! You surprise me , sir . Where do you get these extraordinary ideas ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>By reading modern books and magazines , sir , and of course —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>I thought so .<stage>Pointing to his books .</stage>Read Heine . Cultivate sentiment .<stage>Signing the letter .</stage>Happy ? Has it ever occurred to you that Katie is not happy ?</p>

     <p>No , sir , I can n't truthfully say that it has .</p>

     <p>I imagine not . These are the happiest hours of her life . Young ... in love ... soon to be married .</p>

     <p><stage>After a shorter pause .</stage>Is n't she very young to marry , sir ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Not when she marries into the family ; not when I am in the house —<stage>Touching his chest .</stage>to guard her — to watch over her . Leave it to me .<stage>Enthusiastically .</stage>Sit here , James . Take one of Frederik 's cigars .<stage>JAMES politely thanks him , but does n't take one .</stage>It 's a pleasure to talk to some one who 's interested ; and you are interested , James ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>

     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Er — a little later . Close the door , dear .<stage>She disappears , closing the door .</stage>In order to carry out my plans , I have had to use great diplomacy . I made up my mind to keep Katie in the family ; being a rich man — everybody knows it — I 've had to guard against fortune-hunters . However , I think I 've done away with them , for the whole town understands that Katie has n't a penny — does n't it , James ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I think I 've made that very clear . My dream was to bring Catherine up to keep her in the family , and it has been fulfilled . My plans have turned out beautifully , for she is satisfied and happy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>But did you want her to be happy simply because you are happy , sir ? Do n't you want her to be happy because she is happy ?</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>Nothing , sir ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>You must know something to speak in this manner .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>No , I do n't . You 're a great expert in your line , Mr. Grimm , and I have the greatest respect for your opinion ; but you can n't mate people as you 'd graft tulips . And more than once , I 've — I 've caught her crying and I 've thought perhaps ...</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pooh-poohing .</stage>Crying ? Of course ! Was there ever a girl who did n't cry ?... You amuse me ... with your ideas of life .... Ha ! Have n't I asked her why she was crying ,— and has n't she always said : “ I do n't know why — it 's nothing . ” They love to cry .<stage>Signs the last letter .</stage>But that 's what they all cry over — nothing . James , do you know how I happened to meet Katie ? She was prescribed for me by Doctor MacPherson .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taking the letter .</stage>Prescribed ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>As an antidote . I was growing to be a fussy bachelor , with queer notions . You are young , but see that you do n't need the Doctor , James . Do you know how I was cured ? I 'll tell you . One day , when I had business in the city , the Doctor went with me , and before I knew what he was at — he had marched me into a home for babies .... Katie was nearest the door — the first one . Pinned over her crib was her name : “ Catherine Staats , aged three months . ” She held out her little arms ... so friendless — so pitiful — so alone — and I was done for . We brought her back home , the Doctor , a nurse and I . The first time I carried her up those stairs — all my fine bachelor 's ideas went out of my head . I knew then that my theories were all humbug . I had missed the child in the house who was to teach me everything . I had missed many children in my house . From that day , I watched over her life .<stage>Rising , pointing towards the head of the stairs .</stage>James , I was born in this house — in the little room where I sleep ; and her children shall one day play in the room in which I was born .... That 's very pretty , eh ?<stage>Wipes his eyes , sentimentally .</stage>I 've always seen it that way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coolly .</stage>Yes ; it 's very pretty if it turns out well .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>How can it turn out otherwise ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>To me , sir , it 's not a question of sentiment — of where her children shall play , so long as they play happily .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>What ? Her children can play anywhere — in China if they want to ! Are you in your senses ? A fine reward for giving a child all your affection — to live to see her children playing in China . No , sir ! I propose to keep my household together , by your leave .<stage>Banging his clenched fist on the desk .</stage>It 's my plan .<stage>Cleans his pipe , looking at JAMES from time to time . JAMES posts the letters in a mail-box outside the door . PETER goes to the window , calling off .</stage>Otto ! Run to the office and tell Mr. Frederik he may come in now .<stage>The voice of a gruff Dutchman : “ Het is pastoor 's dag . ” ( It is the pastor 's day .</stage>] Ah , yes ; I had forgotten . It 's William 's day to take flowers to the Pastor .<stage>A knock is heard and , as PETER calls “ Come in , ” WILLIAM , a delicate child of eight , stands timidly in the doorway of the dining-room , hat in hand .</stage><stage>Pats WILLIAM on the shoulder .</stage>How are you to-day , William ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>The Doctor says I 'm well now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Good ! Then you shall take flowers to the church .<stage>Calls off .</stage>A big armful , Otto ! MARTA has entered with a neatly folded , clean handkerchief which she tucks into WILLIAM 'S breast pocket .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a low voice , to JAMES .</stage>There 's your example of freedom ! William 's mother , old Marta 's spoiled child , was free . You remember Annamarie , James ?— let to come and go as she pleased . God knows where she is now ... and here is William with the poor old grandmother .... Run along with the flowers , William .<stage>Gives WILLIAM some pennies as he goes .</stage>How he shoots up , eh , Marta ?</p>

     <speaker>MARTA</speaker>

      <stage>With the hopeless sorrow of the old , as she passes off .</stage>
      <l>Poor child ... poor child .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Give Katie more freedom , eh ? Oh , no ! I shall guard her as I would guard my own , for she is as dear to me as though she were mine , and , by marriage , please God , she shall be a Grimm in name .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>What ? You who were so glad to come back ! James , you need a holiday . Close your desk . Go out and busy yourself with those pet vegetables of yours .

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I 've wondered lately if ... it seems to me that James is interested in Catherine .</p>

     <p>James ? Impossible .</p>

     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>All the more credit , Frederik .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>Yes ; but these are the sort of fellows who dream of getting into the firm . And there are more ways than one .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Do you mean to say — He would n't presume to think of such a thing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>Oh , would n't he ! The class to which he belongs presumes to think of anything . I believe he has been making love to Catherine .</p>

     <p><stage>As though accepting the explanation .</stage>Oh ...<stage>Flurried .</stage>Why , Uncle Peter !... Uncle Peter !... whatever put this notion into your head ?</p>

     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>It 's all nonsense , of course , but —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>I 've always known James .... We went to school together .... James has shown no interest he ought not to have shown , Uncle Peter ,— if that 's what you mean . He has always been very respectful in a perfectly friendly way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Convinced .</stage>Respectful in a perfectly friendly way .<stage>To FREDERIK .</stage>You can n't ask more than that . Thank you , dear , that 's all I wanted . Run along .<stage>Glad to escape , CATHERINE leaves the room .</stage>He was only respectful in a perfectly friendly way .<stage>Slaps FREDERIK on the back .</stage>You 're satisfied now , I hope ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>No , I am not . If she has n't noticed what he has in mind , I have . When I came into this room a few moments ago ,— it was as plain as day . He 's trying to make love to her under our very eyes . I saw him . I wish you would ask him to stay in his office and attend to his own business .<stage>JAMES now re-enters on his way to the gardens .</stage></p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>James , it has just occurred to me — that —<stage>James pauses .</stage>What was your reason for wanting to give up your position ? Had it anything to do with my little girl ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>You mean that — you — you love her ?</p>

     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>FREDERIK gives PETER a glance as though to say , “ Now , do you believe it ? ”</stage>O-ho !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>But she does n't know it , of course ; she never would have known it . I never meant to say a word to her . I understand , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>James ! Come here ... here !...<stage>Bringing JAMES up before him at the desk .</stage>Get your money at the office . You may have that position in Florida . Good-bye , James .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>I 'm very sorry that ... Good-bye , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>You are not to tell her that you 're going . You 're not to bid her good-bye .</p>

Good fortune to you — James . Get this notion out of your head , and perhaps one day you 'll come back to us . We shall see .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Who has entered , saying carelessly to JAMES as he passes him .</stage>Hy 're you , Jim ? Glad Jim 's back . One of the finest lads I ever brought into this world . The DOCTOR is a man of about PETER 'S age , but more powerfully built . He has the bent shoulders of the student and his face is exceedingly intellectual . He is the rare type of doctor who forgets to make out his bills . He has a grizzled grey beard , and his hair is touched with grey . He wears silver-rimmed spectacles . His substantial but unpressed clothing is made by the village tailor .</p>

     <p>Good-morning , Andrew .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>What ? Have I —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>You 're a terrible man for planning , Peter ; but what have you done ?<stage>Casually .</stage>Were you to die ,— say to-morrow ,— how would it be with —<stage>Making a gesture to include the household .</stage>— the rest of them ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>What do you mean ? If I were to die to-morrow ...</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>You wo n't . Do n't worry . Good for a long time yet , but every one must come to it — sooner or later . I mean — what would Katie 's position be in this house ? I know you 've set your heart upon her marrying Frederik , and all that sort of nonsense , but will it work ? I 've always thought ‘ twas a pity Frederik was n't James and James was n't Frederik .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>What !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>Oh , it 's all very well if she wants Frederik , but supposing she does not . Peter , if you mean to do something for her — do it now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Now ? You mean that I — You mean that I might ... die ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>All can and do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Studying the DOCTOR 'S face .</stage>You think ...</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>The machinery is wearing out , Peter . Thought I should tell you . No cause for apprehension , but —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Then why tell me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>When I cured you of that cold — wet flowerbeds — two days ago , I made a discovery .<stage>Seeing CATHERINE enter , he pauses . She is followed by MARTA , carrying a tray containing coffee and a plate of waffles .</stage>Coffee ! I told you not to touch coffee , Peter . It 's rank poison .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>Would n't you like a cup , Doctor ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Yes he 'll take a cup . He wo n't prescribe it , but he 'll drink it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Horrified .</stage>And hot waffles between meals !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Yes , he 'll take hot waffles , too .<stage>MARTA goes to get another plate and more waffles , and CATHERINE follows her .</stage>Now , Andrew , you can n't tell me that I 'm sick . I wo n't have it . Every day we hear of some old boy one hundred years of age who was given up by the doctors at twenty . No , sir ! I 'm going to live to see children in my house ,— Katie 's babies creeping on my old floor ; playing with my old watch-dog , Toby . I 've promised myself a long line of rosy Grimms .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>My God , Peter ! That dog is fifteen years old now . Do you expect nothing to change in your house ? Man , you 're a home worshipper . However , I — I see no reason why —<stage>Lying .</stage>you should n't reach a ripe old age .<stage>Markedly , though feigning to treat the subject lightly .</stage>Er — Peter , I should like to make a compact with you ... that whoever does go first — and you 're quite likely to outlive me ,— is to come back and let the other fellow know ... and settle the question . Splendid test between old neighbours — real contribution to science .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Make a compact to — stuff and nonsense !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>Do n't be too sure of that .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>No , Andrew , no , positively , no . I refuse . Do n't count upon me for any assistance in your spook tests .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>CATHERINE has re-entered with another cup , saucer and plate which she sets on the table , and pours out the coffee .</stage>And how many times do you think you 've been a spook yourself ? You can n't tell me that man is perfect ; that he does n't live more than one life ; that the soul does n't go on and on . Pshaw ! The persistent personal energy must continue , or what is God ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Interested .</stage>Were you speaking of — of ghosts , Doctor ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Yes , he has begun again .<stage>To CATHERINE .</stage>You 're just in time to hear it .<stage>To DR. MACPHERSON .</stage>Andrew , I 'll stay behind , contented in this life ; knowing what I have here on earth , and you shall die and return with your — ha !— persistent personal whatever-it-is , and keep the spook compact . Every time a knock sounds , or a chair squeaks , or the door bangs , I shall say , “ Sh ! There 's the Doctor ! ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Noticing a book which the DOCTOR has taken from his pocket , and reading the title .</stage>“ Are the Dead Alive ? ”</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Puts more sugar in his coffee .</stage>I 'm in earnest , Peter . I 'll promise and I want you to promise , too . Understand that I am not a so-called spiritist . I am merely a seeker after truth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>That 's what they all are — seekers after truth . Rubbish ! Do you really believe such stuff ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>I know that the dead are alive . They 're here — here — near us — close at hand .<stage>PETER , in derision , lifts the table-cloth and peeps under the table — then , taking the lid off the sugar-bowl , peers into it .</stage>Some of the great scientists of the day are of the same opinion .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Bah ! Dreamers ! They accomplish nothing in the world . They waste their lives dreaming of the world to come .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>You can n't call Sir Charles Crookes , the inventor of Crookes Tubes ,— a waster ? Nor Sir Oliver Lodge , the great biologist ; nor Curie , the discoverer of radium ; nor Doctor Lombroso , the founder of Science of Criminology ; nor Doctors Maxwell , deVesmé , Richet , Professor James , of Harvard , and our own Professor Hyslop . Instead of laughing at ghosts , the scientific men of to-day are trying to lay hold of them . The frauds and cheats are being crowded from the field . Science is only just peeping through the half-opened door which was shut until a few years ago .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>If ever I see a ghost , I shall lay violent hands upon it and take it to the police station . That 's the proper place for frauds .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sorry , Peter , very sorry , to see that you , like too many others , make a jest of the most important thing in life . Hyslop is right : man will spend millions to discover the North Pole , but not a penny to discover his immortal destiny .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Stubbornly .</stage>I do n't believe in spook mediums and never shall believe in them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>Probably most professional mediums cheat — perhaps every one of them ; but some of them are capable of real demonstrations at times .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Once a swindler , always a swindler . Besides , why can n't my old friends come straight back to me and say , “ Peter Grimm , here I am ! ” When they do — if they do — I shall be the first man to take off my hat to them and hold out my hand in welcome .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>You ask me why ? Why can n't a telegram travel on a fence instead of on a wire ? Your friends could come back to you if you could put yourself in a receptive condition ; but if you cannot , you must depend upon a medium — a sensitive .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>A what ?<stage>To CATHERINE .</stage>Something new , eh ? He has all the names for them . Yesterday it was “ apports ” — flowers that fell down from nowhere and hit you on the nose . He talks like a medium 's parrot . He has only to close his eyes and along comes the parade . Spooks ! Spooky spooks ! And now he wants me to settle my worldly affairs and join in the procession .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Puzzled .</stage>
      <l>Settle your worldly affairs ? What do you mean ,</l>
      <l>Uncle Peter ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Evasively .</stage>Just some more of his nonsense . Doctor , you 've seen a good many cross to the other world ; tell me — did you ever see one of them come back — one ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sipping his coffee .</stage>Never have , eh ? And never will . Take another cup of poison , Andrew . The DOCTOR gives his cup to CATHERINE , who fills it . PETER passes the waffles to the DOCTOR , at the same time winking at CATHERINE as the DOCTOR takes another .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>There was not perhaps the intimate bond between doctor and patients to bring them back . But in my own family , I have known of a case .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Apart to CATHERINE .</stage>He 's off again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Eager to listen .</stage>Please do n't interrupt , Uncle . I love to hear him tell of —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>I have known of a return such as you mention . A distant cousin died in London and she was seen almost instantly in New York .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>She must have travelled on a biplane , Andrew .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>If my voice can be heard from San Francisco over the telephone , why cannot a soul with a God-given force behind it dart over the entire universe ? Is Thomas Edison greater than God ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Shocked .</stage>Doctor !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>And they can n't tuck it all on telepathy . Telepathy cannot explain the case of a spirit-message giving the contents of a sealed letter known only to the person that died . Here 's another interesting case .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>This is better than “ Puss in Boots , ” is n't it , Katie ? More — er — flibbertigibberty . Katie always loved fairy stories .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Listening eagerly .</stage>Uncle , please .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Ignoring PETER , speaking directly to CATHERINE , who is all attention .</stage>An officer on the Polar vessel , the Jeannette , sent to the Artic regions by the New York Herald , appeared at his wife 's bedside . She was in Brooklyn — he was on the Polar sea . He said to her , “ Count . ” She distinctly heard a ship 's bell and the word “ Count ” again . She had counted six when her husband 's voice said , “ Six bells — and the Jeanette is lost . ” The ship was really lost at the time she saw the vision .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>A bad dream . “ Six bells and the ” — Ha ! Ha ! Spirit messages ! Suet pudding has brought me messages from the North Pole , and I receive messages from Kingdom Come after I 've eaten a piece of mince pie .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>There have been seventeen thousand other cases found to be worth investigation by the London Society of Psychical Research .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Changing .</stage>Supposing , Andrew , that I did “ cross over ” — I believe that 's what you call dying ,— that I did want to come back to see how you and the little Katie and Frederik were getting on , how do you think I could manage to do it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>When we hypnotize subjects , Peter , our thoughts take possession of them . As we enter their bodies , we take the place of a something that leaves them — a shadow-self . This self can be sent out of the room — even to a long distance . This self leaves us entirely after death on the first , second or third day , or so I believe . This is the force which you would employ to come back to earth — the astral envelope .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Yes , but what proof have you , Doctor , that I 've got an — an astral envelope .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Easily .</stage>De Rochas has actually photographed it by radio-photography .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! Ho ! Ho !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>Mind you — they could n't see it when they photographed it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>I imagine not . See it ? Ho ! Ho !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>It stood a few feet away from the sleeper , and was located by striking at the air and watching for the corresponding portion of the sleeper 's body to recoil . By pricking a certain part of this shadow-self with a pin , the cheek of the patient could be made to bleed . The camera was focussed on this part of the shadow-self for fifteen minutes . The result was the profile of a head .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>After a pause .</stage>You believe that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>The experiment has been repeated again and again . Nobody acquainted with the subject denies it now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Turning away from the table as though he had heard enough .</stage>Spook pictures taken by professional mediums !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>De Rochas , who took the pictures of which I speak , is a lawyer of standing ; and the room was full of scientists who saw the pictures taken .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Hypnotized — all of them . Humbug , Andrew !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>Under these conditions , it is quite impossible to hypnotize a room full of people . Perhaps you think the camera was hypnotized ? In similar circumstances , says Lombroso , an unnatural current of cold air went through the room and lowered the thermometer several degrees . Can you hypnotize a thermometer ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Impressed .</stage>That 's wonderful , Doctor !</p>

    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>SCENE . The second act takes place ten days later , towards the close of a rainy afternoon . A fire is burning in the grate and a basket of hickory wood stands beside the hearth . PETER 'S hat is no longer on the peg . His pipes and jar of tobacco are missing . A number of wedding presents are set on a table , some unopened . The interior of the room , with its snapping fire , forms a pleasant contrast to the gloomy exterior . The day is fading into dusk . MRS. BATHOLOMMEY is at the piano , playing the wedding march from “ Lohengrin . ” Four little girls are grouped about her , singing the words to the air .</stage>
     <stage>“ Faithful and true : We lead ye forth , Where love triumphant Shall lighten the way . ”</stage>
     <stage>“ Bright star of love , Flower of the earth , Shine on ye both On Love 's perfect day . ”</stage>
    </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. BATHOLOMMEY</speaker>
     <p>That 's better . Children , remember that this is to be a very quiet wedding . You 're to be here at noon to-morrow . You 're not to speak as you enter the room and take your places near the piano . Miss Staats will come down from her room ,— at least I suppose she will — and will stand ...<stage>Thinks .</stage>I do n't know where — but you 're to stop when I look at you . Watch me as though I were about to be married .<stage>She takes her place at the foot of the stairs and the children repeat the song until she has marched across the room and stationed herself in some appropriate corner . As FREDERIK appears from the hall , where he leaves his raincoat and umbrella , MRS. BATHOLOMMEY motions the children to silence .</stage>That will do , dears , thank you . Hurry home between showers .<stage>The children go as she explains to FREDERIK .</stage>My Sunday-school scholars .... I thought your dear uncle would like a song at the wedding . I know how bright and cheery he would have been — poor man . Dear , noble , charitable soul !</p>

     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p><stage>Taking a telegram from his pocket-book .</stage>Well , we shall soon be off to Europe . I 've just had a telegram to say a cabin has been reserved for me on the Imperator . To-morrow , thank God , we shall take the afternoon train to New York .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. BATHOLOMMEY</speaker>
     <p>I must confess that I 'm very glad . Of course , I 'm happy to stay and chaperone Catherine ; but poor Mr. Batholommey has been alone at the parsonage for ten days ... ever since your dear uncle ...<stage>Pauses , unwinding yarn , then unburdening her mind .</stage>I did n't think at first that Catherine could persuade herself to marry you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sharply .</stage>I do n't understand you , Mrs. Batholommey .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. BATHOLOMMEY</speaker>
     <p>I mean she seemed so averse to — to an immediate marriage ; but of course it was your uncle 's last request , and that influenced her more than anything else . So it 's to be a June wedding , after all ; he has his wish . You 'll be married in ten days from the time he left us .<stage>Remembering .</stage>Some more letters marked personal came for him while you were out . I put them in the drawer —<stage>Points to desk .</stage>with the rest . It seems odd to think the postman brings your uncle 's letters regularly , yet he is not here .</p>

     <p><stage>Looking towards the door of the office .</stage>Did Hartman come ?</p>

     <p>Yes . He seemed rather surprised that you 'd sent for him .</p>

     <p>Did he seem inclined to stay ?</p>

He 's asleep , I think .<stage>MARTA goes up the stairs and into WILLIAM 'S room .</stage>By the way , Mr. Batholommey was very much excited when he heard that your uncle had left a personal memorandum concerning us .

     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>No , thank you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>I appreciate the fact that you came on my uncle 's account . I have no ill-feeling against you , Hartman .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>I 'm not refusing to stay because of any ill-feeling . I 'm going because I know that you 'll sell out before your uncle 's cold in his grave . I do n't care to stay to see the old place change hands .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>I ? Sell out ? My intention is to carry out every wish of my dear old uncle 's .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Exit into the office .</stage>I hope so . I have n't forgotten that you wanted him to sell out to Hicks of Rochester on the very day he died . CATHERINE comes from WILLIAM 'S room , simply dressed in white — no touch of mourning . FREDERIK goes to the foot of the stairs and calls softly .</p>

     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>As before .</stage>Yes .... Just as he wished . Everything is just as he ....<stage>With a change of manner — earnestly — looking at FREDERIK .</stage>Frederik , I do n't want to go away . I do n't want to go to Europe . If only I could stay quietly here in —<stage>Tears in her voice as she looks round the room .</stage>— in my dear home .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>Why do you want to stay in this old cottage — with its candles and lamps and shadows ? It 's very gloomy , very depressing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>I do n't want to leave this house .... I do n't want any home but this .<stage>Panic-stricken .</stage>Do n't take me away Frederik . I know you 've never really liked it at Grimm 's Manor . Are you sure you 'll want to come back to live here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p><stage>As though speaking to a child .</stage>Of course . I 'll do anything you ask .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>I — I 've always wanted to please ...<stage>After a slight pause , finding it difficult to speak his name .</stage>Uncle Peter .... I felt that I owed everything to him .... If he had lived ... if I could see his happiness at our marriage — it would make me happy ;<stage>Pathetically .</stage>but he 's gone ... and ... I 'm afraid we 're making a mistake . I do n't feel towards you as I ought , Frederik . I 've told you again and again ; but I want to tell you once more : I 'm willing to marry you ... but I do n't love you — I never shall .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>How do you know ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>I know ... I know .... It seems so disloyal to speak like this after I promised him ; but —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>Yes , you did promise Uncle Peter you 'd marry me , did n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>And he died believing you ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>Then it all comes to this : are you going to live up to your promise ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>That 's it . That 's what makes me try to live up to it .<stage>Wiping her eyes .</stage>But you know how I feel .... You understand ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>Perfectly ; you do n't quite know your own mind .... Very few young girls do , I suppose . I love you and in time you 'll grow to care for me .<stage>MARTA re-enters from WILLIAM 'S room and closing the door comes down the stairs and passes off .</stage>What are we to do with that child ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>He 's to stay here , of course .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>The child should be sent to some institution . What claim has he on you — on any of us ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>Why do you dislike him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>I do n't , but —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , you do . I can n't understand it . I remember how angry you were when you came back from college and found him living here . You never mention his mother 's name , yet you played together as children . When Uncle tried to find Annamarie and bring her back , you were the only one opposed to it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>William is an uncomfortable child to have in the house . He has a way of staring at people as though he had a perpetual question on his lips . It 's most annoying .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>What question ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>As for his mother — I 've never seen her since she left this house and I do n't care to hear her name on your lips . Her reputation is —<stage>The rain starts pattering on the shingled roof .</stage>Tc ! More rain ... the third day of it ....<stage>Going to the window — calling .</stage>Otto !<stage>Angrily .</stage>Otto ! See what the wind has done — those trellises .<stage>Bangs the window shut .</stage>That old gardener should have been laid off years ago .... By the way , his son James is here for a few hours — to straighten matters out . I must see how he 's getting on .<stage>Taking her hand , drawing her towards the table with a change of manner .</stage><stage>Pats her cheek and exits .</stage>Have you seen all the wedding presents , Kitty ? I 'll be back in a few minutes . CATHERINE stands over her wedding presents just as he left her — not looking at them — her eyes filled with tears . The door is suddenly opened and the DOCTOR enters , a tweed shawl over his shoulders , wearing a tweed cap . He has a book under his arm .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>How 's William ?<stage>CATHERINE tries to hide her tears , but he sees through her . He tosses his cap , coat and book on the sofa .</stage>What 's the matter ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>Nothing .... I was only thinking .... I was hoping that those we love ... and lose ... can n't see us here . I 'm beginning to believe there 's not much happiness in this world .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>Why , you little snip . I 've a notion to spank you . Talking like that with life before you ! Read this book , child ;<stage>Gesturing towards the book on the sofa .</stage>it proves that the dead do see us ; they do come back .<stage>Walks to the foot of the stairs — turns .</stage>Catherine , I understand that you 've not a penny to your name — unless you marry Frederik ; that he has inherited you along with the orchids and tulips . Do n't let that influence you . If Peter 's plans bind you — and you look as though they did — my door 's open . Think it over . It 's not too late .<stage>Goes half-way up the stairs — then pauses .</stage><stage>Pointing to the wedding presents stand in the way of your future . [ Exit into WILLIAM 'S room . The rain increases . The sky grows blacker — the room darker .

     <p>Uncle Peter ! Uncle Peter ! Why did you do it ? Why did you ask it ? Oh , dear ! Oh , dear ! If you could see me now .<stage>She stands rigid — her arms outstretched . MARTA , who has silently entered from the dining-room with fresh candles , goes to CATHERINE . CATHERINE suddenly buries her face on MARTA 'S broad breast , breaking into sobs ; then recovering , wipes her eyes .</stage>There , there ... I must n't cry ... others have troubles , too , have n't they ?</p>

     <p>She knows that our door is open .... The rain beats against the windows . A sharp double knock is heard at the door . CATHERINE starts as though suddenly brought to herself , hastily goes into the next room , taking the DOCTOR 'S book with her . MARTA has hurried towards the front door , when the REV . MR. BATHOLOMMEY and COLONEL LAWTON appear in the hall as though they had entered quickly , to escape the storm . MARTA , greeting them , passes of to tell FREDERIK of their presence . The REV . MR. BATHOLOMMEY wears a long , black cloth , rain-proof coat . COLONEL LAWTON wears a rubber poncho . COLONEL LAWTON is a tall man with a thin brown beard and moustache , about forty-eight . He is dressed in a Prince Albert coat , unpressed trousers , and a negligée shirt . He wears spectacles and has a way of throwing back his head and peering at people before answering them . The REV . MR. BATHOLOMMEY sets his umbrella in the hall and the COLONEL hangs his broad-brimmed hat on the handle — as though to let it drip .</p>

     <p>Er — er — COLONEL LAWTON goes to the sideboard and pours out two drinks from a decanter . A heavy roll of thunder now ends in a sharp thunderclap . MRS. BATHOLOMMEY , who is entering the room , gives a cry and puts her hands over her face . COLONEL LAWTON bolts his whiskey . The REV . MR. BATHOLOMMEY takes a glass and stands with it in his hand .</p>

     <p><stage>Slipping his hand through COLONEL LAWTON 'S arm . They seem to look each other in the eye .</stage>You were perfectly right about it , Thomas , I should have made a will ... I — suppose it is a little too late , is n't it ?... It would be — er — unusual to do it now , would n't it ? COLONEL LAWTON , who has heard nothing — seen nothing — moves away as though PETER had never held his arm , and goes up into the hall for his cape and overshoes .</p>

     <speaker>COLONEL LAWTON</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Noticing an old gold-headed walking-stick in the hall .</stage>
      <l>Oh , er — what are you going to do with all the old man 's family relics ,</l>
      <l>Frederik ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>The junk , you mean ? I shall lay it on some scrap-heap , I suppose . It 's not worth a penny .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COLONEL LAWTON</speaker>
     <p>I 'm not so sure of that . They say there 's a lot of money paid for this sort of trash .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>Is that so ? Not a bad idea to have a dealer in to look it over . PETER stands listening , a faint smile on his face .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. BATHOLOMMEY</speaker>
     <p>If I could have the old clock — cheap , Frederik , I 'd take it off your hands .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sets his watch by the clock . MRS. BATHOLOMMEY gives him a look and joins her husband at the door .</stage>I 'll find out how much it 's worth . I shall have everything appraised .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COLONEL LAWTON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Exit , closing the door .</stage>Good-night .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. BATHOLOMMEY</speaker>
     <p><stage>As REV . MR. BATHOLOMMEY goes out — calling after him .</stage><stage>MRS. BATHOLOMMEY leaves the room too disgusted for words . FREDERIK goes into the office .</stage>Henry , Catherine wants you to come back for supper .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Now alone .</stage>We live and learn ... and oh ! what I have learned since I came back ....<stage>He goes to his own particular peg in the vestibule and hangs up his hat . He glances at the wedding presents . Presently he sees the flowers which CATHERINE has placed on the desk . With a smile , he touches the flowers . MARTA enters with another lamp , which she places on a table . As PETER 'S eyes rest on MARTA , he nods and smiles in recognition , waiting for a response .</stage>Well , Marta ?... Do n't you know your old master ?... No ?... No ?...<stage>She winds the clock and leaves the room .</stage>I seem to be a stranger in my own house ... yet the watch-dog knew me and wagged his tail as I came in .<stage>He stands trying to comprehend it all .</stage>Well ! Well !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looking at his watch , re-enters from the office and goes to the ‘ phone , which presently rings . FREDERIK instantly lifts the receiver as though not wishing to attract attention . In a low voice .</stage>Yes ... I was waiting for you . How are you , Mr. Hicks ?<stage>Listens .</stage>I 'm not anxious to sell — no . I prefer to carry out my dear old uncle 's wishes .<stage>PETER eyes him — a faint smile on his lips .</stage>If I got my price ? Well ... of course in that case ... I might be tempted . To-morrow ? No , I can n't see you to-morrow . I 'm going to be married to-morrow , and leave at once for New York . Thank you .<stage>Listens .</stage>To-night ? Very well , but I do n't want it known . I 'll sell , but it must be for more than the price my uncle refused . Make it ten thousand more and it 's done .<stage>Listens .</stage>You 'll come to-night ?... Yes , yes ....<stage>Listens at the ‘ phone .</stage>The dear old man told you his plans never failed , eh ? God rest his soul !<stage>Laughing indulgently .</stage>Ha ! Ha ! Ha !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Ha ! Ha ! Ha !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p><stage>Echoing HICKS ’ words .</stage>What would he say if he knew ? What could he say ? Everything must change . A far-away rumble of thunder is heard — the lightning flickers at the window and a flash is seen on the telephone which tinkles and responds as though from the electric shock . Exclaiming “ Ugh , ” FREDERIK drops the receiver — which hangs down .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>The storm passes as he speaks into the receiver without touching the telephone .</stage>Good-evening , my friend . We shall soon meet — face to face . You wo n't be able to carry this matter through ....<stage>Looking into space as though he could see the future .</stage>You 're not well and you 're going out to supper to-night ; ... you will eat something that will cause you to pass over .... I shall see you to-morrow .... A happy crossing !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p><stage>Picks up the receiver .</stage>Hello ?... You do n't feel well , you say ?<stage>Then echoing the purport of HICKS ’ answer .</stage>I see .... Your lawyer can attend to everything to-night without you . Very well . It 's entirely a question of money , Mr. Hicks . Send your lawyer to the Grimm Manor Hotel . I 'll arrange at once for a room . Good-bye .<stage>Hangs up the receiver .</stage><stage>He lights a fresh cigarette — his face expressing the satisfaction he feels in the prospect of a perfectly idle future . PETER looks at him as though to say : “ And that 's the boy whom I loved and trusted ! ” FREDERIK gets his hat , throws his coat over his arm , and hastens out .</stage>That 's off my mind .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Turns and faces the door leading into the next room , as though he could feel the presence of some one waiting there .</stage>Yes ... I am still in the house . Come in ... come in ...<stage>He repeats the signal of the first act .</stage>Ou — oo .<stage>The door opens slowly — and CATHERINE enters as though at PETER 'S call . She looks about her , not understanding . He holds out his arms to her . CATHERINE walks slowly towards him . He takes her in his arms , but she does not respond . She does not know that she is being held .</stage>There ! There !... Do n't worry .... It 's all right .... We 'll arrange things very differently . I 've come back to change all my plans .<stage>She moves away a step — just out of his embrace . He tries to call her back .</stage><stage>She moves about the room in thought . As PETER watches her — she pauses near his desk .</stage>Katie ! ... Ca n't I make my presence known to you ? Katie ! Ca n't my love for you outlive me ? Is n't it here in the home ?... Do n't cry .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Suddenly .</stage>Crying does n't help matters .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>She hears me . She does n't know it , but she hears me . She 's cheering up .<stage>She inhales the flowers — a half smile on her lips .</stage><stage>Suddenly giving way to the realization of her loss , CATHERINE sighs .</stage>That 's right , you have n't smiled before since I died .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Correcting himself .</stage>I — I mean — since I learned that there was a happier place than the world I left .... I 'm a trifle confused . I 've not had time to adjust myself to these new conditions .<stage>CATHERINE smiles sadly — goes up to the window , and , leaning against the pane , looks out into the night . PETER continues comfortingly .</stage>The dead have never really died , you know . We could n't die if we tried . We 're all about you .... Look at the gardens : they 've died , have n't they ? But there they are all the better for it . Death is the greatest thing in the world . It 's really a — Ha !— delightful experience . What is it , after all ? A nap from which we waken rested , refreshened ... a sleep from which we spring up like children tumbling out of bed — ready to frolic through another world . I was an old man a few days ago ; now I 'm a boy . I feel much younger than you — much younger .<stage>A conflict is going on in CATHERINE 'S mind . She walks to the chair by the fireplace and sits — her back to the audience . He approaches her and lays a tender hand on her shoulder .</stage>I know what you 're thinking .... Katie , I want you to break that very foolish promise I asked you to make . You 're almost tempted to . Break it ! Break it at once ; then —<stage>Glancing smilingly towards the door through which he came — as though he wished to leave — like a child longing to go back to play .</stage>then I could — take the journey back in peace .... I can n't go until you do — and I ... I long to go .... Is n't my message any clearer to you ?<stage>Reading her mind .</stage>You have a feeling ... an impression of what I 'm saying ; but the words ... the words are not clear .... Mm ... let me see .... If you can n't understand me — there 's the Doctor , he 'll know how to get the message — he 'll find the way .... Then I can hurry back ... home ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Helplessly — changing her position like a tired child .</stage>
      <l>Oh ,</l>
      <l>I 'm so alone .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Cheerily .</stage>Not alone at all — not at all . I shall drop in very often ... and then , there 's your mother .<stage>Suddenly remembering .</stage>Oh , yes , I had almost forgotten . I have a message for you , Katie ....<stage>He seats himself in a chair which is almost in front of her .</stage>I 've met your mother .<stage>She sits in a reverie . PETER continues with the air of a returned traveller relating his experiences .</stage>She heard that I had crossed over and there she was — waiting for me . You 're thinking of it , are n't you ? Wondering if we met .... Yes , that was the first interesting experience . She knew me at once . “ You were Peter Grimm , ” she said , “ before you knew better ” — that 's what they call leaving this world — “ to know better . ” You call it “ dying . ”<stage>Confidentially .</stage>She 's been here often , it seems , watching over you . I told her how much I loved you and said that you had a happy home . I spoke of your future — of my plans for you and Frederik . “ Peter Grimm , ” she said , “ you 've over-looked the most important thing in the world — love . You have n't given her her right to the choice of her lover — her right ! ” Then it came over me that I 'd made a terrible mistake ... and at that minute , you called to me .<stage>Impressively .</stage>In the darkness surrounding all I had left behind , there came a light ... a glimmer where you stood ... a clear call in the night .... It seemed as though I had not been away one second ... but in that second , you had suffered .... Now I am back to show you the way .... I am here to put my hand on your dear head and give you your mother 's blessing ; to say she will be with you in spirit until she holds you in her arms — you and your loved husband —<stage>CATHERINE turns in her chair and looks towards the door of the room in which JAMES is working . PETER catches the thought .</stage>— yes , James , it 's you .... And the message ended in this kiss .<stage>Prints a kiss on her cheek .</stage>Ca n't you think I 'm with you , dear child ? Ca n't you think I 'm trying to help you ? Ca n't you even hope ? Oh , come , at least hope ! Anybody can hope . CATHERINE rises with an entire change of manner — takes a bright red blossom from the vase on PETER 'S desk — then deliberately walks to the door of the room in which JAMES is working . PETER follows her action hopefully . She does not tap on the door , however , but turns and sits at the piano — in thought — not facing the piano . She puts PETER 'S flowers against her face . Then , laying the flowers on the piano , sings softly three or four bars of the song she sang in the first act — and stops abruptly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>To herself .</stage>That I should sit here singing — at a time like this !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Sing ! Sing ! Why not ? Lift up your voice like a bird ! Your old uncle does n't sleep out there in the dust . That 's only the dream . He 's here — here — alive . All his age gone and youth glowing in his heart . If I could only tell you what lies before you — before us all ! If people even suspected what the next life really is , they would n't waste time here — I can tell you that . They 'd do dreadful things to get away from this existence — make for the nearest pond or —<stage>Pausing abruptly .</stage>Ah , here comes someone who 'll know all about it !<stage>The DOCTOR comes from WILLIAM 'S room . PETER greets him in a cordial but casual way , as though he had parted from him only an hour before .</stage>Well , Andrew , I apologize .<stage>Bowing obsequiously .</stage>You were right . I apologize .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>How is he , Doctor ?</p>

     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>William is better . Dropped off to sleep again . Ca n't quite understand him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>I apologize . I said that if I could come back , I would ; and here I am — apologizing . Andrew ! Andrew !<stage>Trying to attract DR. MACPHERSON 'S attention .</stage>I have a message , but I can n't get it across . This is your chance . I want you to take it . I do n't wish Catherine to marry Frederik .</p>

     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>He 's somewhat feverish yet .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>It 's a puzzling case ....</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>What ? Mine ?</p>

    <sp>

     <p><stage>Getting a pad from his pocket — writing out a prescription with his fountain pen .</stage>I 'll leave this prescription at the druggist 's —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>I 'm quite shut out .... They 've closed the door and turned the key on me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Suddenly noticing that CATHERINE seems more cheerful .</stage>What 's happened ? I left you in tears and here you are — all smiles .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I — I am happier — for some reason .... For the last few minutes I — I 've had such a strange feeling .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>That 's odd : so have I ! Been as restless as a hungry mouse . Something seemed to draw me down here — can n't explain it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>I 'm beginning to be felt in this house .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sitting at the table .</stage>Catherine , I have the firm conviction that , in a very short time , I shall hear from Peter .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>I hope so . It 's high time now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Thinks .</stage>What I want is some positive proof ; some absolute test ; some — er — CATHERINE has seated herself at the table .— Unconsciously they both occupy the same seats as in the first act .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>The trouble is with other people , not with us . You want us to give all sorts of proofs ; and here we are just back for a little while — very poorly put together on the chance that you 'll see us at all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>Poor old Peter — bless his heart !<stage>His elbow on the table as though he had been thinking over the matter . CATHERINE sits quietly listening .</stage>If he kept that compact with me , and came back ,— do you know what I 'd ask him first ? If our work goes on .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Well , now , that 's a regular sticker . It 's bothered me considerably since I crossed over .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>What do you mean , Doctor ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>The question every man wants the answer to : what 's to become of me — me — my work ? Am I going to be a bone setter in the next life and he a tulip man ?... I wonder .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Andrew , I 've asked everybody — Tom , Dick and Harry . One spirit told me that sometimes our work does go on ; but he was an awful liar — you knew we do n't drop our earth habits at once . He said that a genius is simply a fellow who 's been there before in some other world and knows his business . Now then :<stage>Confidentially preparing to open an argument — sitting in his old seat at the table , as in the first act .</stage>it stands to reason , Andrew , does n't it ? What chance has the beginner compared with a fellow who knew his business before he was born ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Unconsciously grasping the thought .</stage>I believe it is possible to have more than one chance at our work .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>There ... you caught that .... Why can n't you take my message to</l>
      <l>Catherine ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rising to get his shawl — gruffly .</stage>Thought over what I told you concerning this marriage ? Not too late to back out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>He 's beginning to take the message .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>Everything 's arranged : I shall be married as Uncle Peter wished . I sha'n ' t change my mind .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Picks up his shawl .</stage>H 'm !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Trying to detain the DOCTOR — tugging at his shawl without seeming to pull it .</stage>Do n't give up ! Do n't give up ! A girl can always change her mind — while there 's life . Do n't give up !<stage>The DOCTOR turns , facing PETER , looking directly at him as he puts his hand in his coat pocket .</stage>You heard that , eh ?... Did n't you ? Yes ? Did it cross over ?... What ?... It did ?... You 're looking me in the face , Andrew ; can you see me ?<stage>The DOCTOR takes a pencil out of his pocket , writes a prescription , throws his shawl over his shoulder — turning his back towards PETER and facing CATHERINE .</stage>Tc ! Tc ! Tc !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>Good-night .</p>

     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>CATHERINE goes quietly to the fireplace , kneeling down , mends the fire , and remains there sitting on an ottoman .</stage>Good-night .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Calling after the DOCTOR .</stage>If I could only make some sign — to start you thinking ; but I can n't depend upon you , I see that ....<stage>Then changing — as though he had an idea .</stage>Ah , yes ! There is another way . Now to work .<stage>With renewed activity , he taps in the direction of the office door , although he himself stands three feet away from it . The door opens promptly and JAMES appears on the threshold — pen in hand — as though something had made him rise suddenly from his desk . CATHERINE , still seated , does not see JAMES , who stands looking at her — remembering that she is to be married on the following day . PETER tempts JAMES .</stage>Yes , she is pretty , James ... young and lovely .... Look !... There are kisses tangled in her hair where it curls ... hundreds of them .... Are you going to let her go ? Her lips are red with the red of youth . Every smile is an invocation to life . Who could resist her smiles ? Can you , James ? No , you will not let her go . And her hands , James .... Look ! Hands made to clasp and cling to yours . Imagine her little feet trudging happily about your home .... Look at her shoulders ... shaped for a resting-place for a little head .... You were right , James , we should ask nothing of our girls but to marry the men they love and be happy wives and happy mothers of happy children . You feel what I am saying .... You could n't live without her , could you ? No ? Very well , then —<stage>Changing abruptly .</stage>Now , it 's your turn . JAMES pauses a moment . There is silence . Then he comes forward a step and CATHERINE , hearing him , turns and rises .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Coldly — respectfully .</stage>Miss Grimm ...</p>

     <p>James ...</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>I felt that you were here and wished to speak to me . I — I do n't know why ...</p>

     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Good for James .</p>

     <p><stage>Shaking hands with him .</stage>I 'm very glad to see you again , James .<stage>When PETER sees that he has brought the two young people together , he stands in the background . The lovers are in the shadow , but PETER 'S figure is marked and clear .</stage>Why did you go away ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>Oh — er —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>And without saying a word .</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Where are you going ? What do you intend to do ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Half-heartedly .</stage>Father and I are going to try our luck together . We 're going to start with a small fruit farm . It will give me a chance to experiment ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Her voice trembling .</stage>It will seem very strange when I come back home .... Uncle gone ... and you , James .</p>

     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>I hope you 'll be happy , Catherine .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>James , Uncle died smiling at me — thinking of me ... and just before he went , he gave me his mother 's wedding ring and asked me to marry Frederik . I shall never forget how happy he was when I promised . That was all he wanted . His last smile was for me ... and there he sat — still smiling after he was gone ... the smile of a man leaving the world perfectly satisfied — at peace . It 's like a hand on my heart — hurting it — when I question anything he wanted . I could n't meet him in the hereafter if I did n't do everything he wished ; I could n't say my prayers at night ; I could n't speak his name in them .... He trusted me ; depended upon me ; did everything for me ; so I must do this for him .... I wanted you to know this , James , because ...</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>Why have n't you told Frederik the truth ?</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>I have .</p>

     <p>That you do n't love him ?<stage>CATHERINE does n't answer , but JAMES knows .</stage>And he 's willing to take you like that ?— a little girl like you — in that way .... God ! He 's rotten all the way through . He 's even worse than I thought . Katie , I did n't mean to say a word of this to-day — not a word ; but a moment since — something made me change my mind — I do n't know what !...<stage>PETER smiles .</stage>I felt that I must talk to you . You looked so young , so helpless , such a child . You 've never had to think for yourself — you do n't know what you 're doing . You could n't live under it , Catherine . You 're making the greatest mistake possible , if you marry where you do n't love . Why should you carry out your uncle 's plans ? You 're going to be wretched for life to please a dead man who does n't know it ; or , if he does know it , regrets it bitterly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>I agree with you now , James .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>You mus n't say that , James .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>But I will say it — I will speak my mind . I do n't care how fond you were of your uncle or how much he did for you — it was n't right to ask this of you . It was n't fair . The whole thing is the mistake of a very obstinate old man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>James !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>I loved him , too ; but he was an obstinate old man . Sometimes I think it was the Dutch blood in his veins .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>A very frank , outspoken fellow . I like to hear him talk — now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>Do you know why I was sent away ? Why I quarrelled with your uncle ? I said that I loved you ... he asked me .... I did n't tell him because I had any hopes — I had n't .... I have n't now ....<stage>Struck .</stage>But in spite of what I 'm saying ... I do n't know what makes me think that I ... I could take you in my arms and you would let me ... but I do think it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Retreats , backing towards PETER .</stage>No !... Do n't touch me , James — you must n't ! Do n't !... Do n't ! PETER pushes her into JAMES ’ arms , without touching her . She exclaims “ Oh , James ! ” and fairly runs towards JAMES as though violently propelled . In reality , she thinks that she is yielding to an impulse . As she reaches him , she exclaims “ No , ” and turns back , but JAMES , with outstretched arms , catches her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Draws her to him .</stage>You love me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>Do n't make me say that , James .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>I will make you say it ! You do love me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>No matter if I do , that wo n't alter matters .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>What ? What ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>No , no , do n't say any more .... I wo n't hear it .<stage>She stands free of JAMES — then turns and walks to the stairs .</stage>Good-bye , Jim .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>Do you mean it ? Are you really going to sacrifice yourself because of — Am I really losing you ?... Catherine ! Catherine !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>In tears — beseechingly .</stage>Please do n't .... Please do n't ....</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>FREDERIK enters . Until the entrance of FREDERIK , PETER has had hope in his face , but now he begins to feel apprehensive .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p><stage>Throwing his hat and coat on a chair .</stage>I have some work to do — more of my uncle 's unopened mail ; then I 'll join you , Hartman . We must — er — make haste . JAMES looks at CATHERINE , then at FREDERIK . CATHERINE gives him an imploring glance — urging him not to speak . FREDERIK has gone to PETER 'S desk .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p><stage>Goes towards the hall .</stage>I 'll come back later .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>Catherine , have you asked James to be present at the ceremony to-morrow ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>James , will you —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>I shall be leaving early in the morning .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p><stage>Exit JAMES .</stage>Too bad ! FREDERIK lights the desk candles , takes the mail out of the drawer — opens two letters — tears them up after barely glancing at them — then sees CATHERINE still standing at the foot of the stairs — her back to him . He lays the cigar on the desk , crosses , and , taking her in his arms , kisses her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a revulsion of feeling .</stage>No ! No ! No !<stage>She covers her face with her hands — trying to control herself .</stage>Please !... Not now ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>Why not now ?<stage>Suspiciously .</stage>Has Hartman been talking to you ? What has he been saying to you ?<stage>CATHERINE starts slowly up the stairs .</stage>Wait a moment , please ....<stage>As she retreats a step up the stairs , he follows her .</stage>Do you really imagine you — you care for that fellow ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>Do n't — please .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>I 'm sorry to insist . Of course , I knew there was a sort of school-girl attachment on your part ; ... that you 'd known each other since childhood . I do n't take it at all seriously . In three months , you 'll forget him . I must insist , however , that you do not speak to him again to-night . After to-morrow — after we are married — I 'm quite sure that you will not forget you are my wife , Catherine — my wife .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>She escapes into her room . FREDERIK goes to his desk .</stage>I sha'n ' t forget .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Confronting FREDERIK .</stage>Now , sir , I have something to say to you , Frederik Grimm , my beloved nephew ! I had to die to find you out ; but I know you !<stage>FREDERIK is reading a letter .</stage>You sit there opening a dead man 's mail — with the heart of a stone — thinking : “ He 's gone ! he 's gone !— so I 'll break every promise ! ” But there is something you have forgotten — something that always finds us out : the law of reward and punishment . Even now it is overtaking you . Your hour has struck .<stage>FREDERIK takes up another letter and begins to read it ; then , as though disturbed by a passing thought , he puts it down . As though perplexed by the condition of his own mind , he ponders , his eyes resting unconsciously on PETER .</stage>Your hour has struck .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p><stage>To himself .</stage>What in the world is the matter with me to-night ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Read !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p><stage>Has opened a long , narrow , blue envelope containing a letter on blue paper and a small photograph . He stares at the letter , aghast .</stage>My God ! Here 's luck .... Here 's luck ! From that girl Annamarie to my uncle . Oh , if he had read it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Standing in front of FREDERIK looks into space — as though reading the letter in the air .</stage>“ Dear Mr. Grimm : I have not written because I can n't do anything to help William , and I am ashamed . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>Wh !<stage>As though he had read the first part to himself , now reads aloud .</stage><stage>Hesitates .</stage>“ Do n't be too hard upon me .... I have gone hungry trying to save a few pennies for him , but I never could ; and now I see that I cannot hope to have him back . William is far better off with you . I — ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Going back of the desk , standing behind FREDERIK 'S chair .</stage>Go on ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>“ I wish that I might see him once again . Perhaps I could come and go in the night . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>That 's a terrible thing for a mother to write .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p><stage>Who has been looking down at the letter — suddenly feeling PETER 'S presence .</stage>Who 's that ? Who 's in this room ?<stage>Looks over his shoulder — then glances about .</stage>I could have sworn somebody was looking over my shoulder ... or had come in at the door ... or ...<stage>But seeing no one — he continues .</stage>“ I met someone from home ; ... if there is any truth in the rumour of Catherine 's marriage — it must n't be , Mr. Grimm — it must n't be ... not to Frederik . For Frederik is my little boy 's — ”<stage>FREDERIK gives a furtive glance upstairs at the door of the child 's room . Picks up the small picture which was in the envelope .</stage>Her picture ...<stage>Turns it over — looks at the back — reads .</stage><stage>FREDERIK , conscious-stricken for the time being , bows his head .</stage>“ For my boy , from Annamarie . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>For the first time since I entered this house , you are yourself , Frederik Grimm . Once more a spark of manhood is alight in your soul . Courage ! It 's not too late to repent . Turn back , lad ! Follow your impulse . Take the little boy in your arms . Go down on your knees and ask his mother 's pardon . Turn over a fresh page , that I may leave this house in peace ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p><stage>Looks about uneasily , then glances towards the door leading into the hall .</stage>Who is at the door ? Curious ... I thought I heard someone at ...</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>I am at the door — I , Peter Grimm ! Annamarie is at the door — the little girl who is ashamed to come home ; the old mother in the kitchen breaking her heart for some word . William is at the door — your own flesh and blood — nameless ; Katie , sobbing her heart out — you can hear her ; all — we are all at the door — every soul in this house . We are all at the door of your conscience , Frederik .... Do n't keep us waiting , my boy . It 's very hard to kill the love I had for you . I long to love you again — to take you back to my heart — lies and all .<stage>FREDERIK rises — in deep thought .</stage>Yes ! Call her ! Tell her the truth . Give her back her promise .... Give her back her home .... Close the door on a peaceful , happy , silent room and go . Think — think of that moment when you give her back her freedom ! Think of her joy , her gratitude , her affection . It 's worth living for , lad . Speak ! Make haste and call her , Fritz .<stage>FREDERIK takes several steps — then turns back to the desk . He tears the letter in two , muttering to himself , “ Damn the woman , ” and sinks into his chair .</stage>Frederik Grimm , stand up before me !<stage>FREDERIK starts to rise , but changes his mind .</stage>Stand up !<stage>FREDERIK rises — not knowing why he has risen . PETER points an accusing finger at FREDERIK .</stage>Liar to the dead ! Cheat , thief , hypocrite ! You sha'n ' t have my little girl . You only want her for a week , a day , an hour . I refuse . I have come back to take her from you and you cannot put me to rest .... I have come back .... You cannot drive me from your thoughts — I am there ....<stage>Tapping his forehead , without touching it .</stage>I am looking over your shoulder ... in at the window ... under the door .... You are breathing me in the air .... I am looking at your heart .<stage>He brings his clenched fist down on the desk in answer to FREDERIK 'S gesture ; but , despite the seeming violence of the blow , he makes no sound .</stage>Hear me ! You shall hear me ! Hear me !<stage>Calling loudly .</stage>Hear me ! Hear me ! Hear me ! Will nobody hear me ? Is there no one in this house to hear me ? No one ? Has my journey been in vain ?...<stage>For the first time fully realizing the situation .</stage>Oh , must we stand or fall by the mistakes we made here and the deed we did ? Is there no second chance in this world ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p><stage>With a sneer on his lips as though trying to banish his thoughts .</stage>Psh ! MARTA enters with a tray , containing a pot of coffee and a plate of small cakes . PETER , who has watched her with appealing eyes , like a dog craving attention , glances from her to the desk and from the desk back to MARTA — trying to tempt her to look at the torn letter . FREDERIK , deep in thought , does not notice her . PETER points to the desk as though to say , “ Look ! ” After a pause , she picks up the picture and the letter — holding them in one hand to clear a spot for the tray which she is about to set on the desk .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Speaking in a hushed voice .</stage>Marta , see what you have in your hand ... that letter ... there ... read it .... Run to Catherine with it . Read it from the house-tops .... The letter ... Look ! There you have the story of Annamarie .... It is the one way to know the truth in this house — the only way .... There in your hand — the letter .... He will never speak .... The letter for Catherine . MARTA sets down the picture and the letter ; but something prompts her to look at them ; however , before she can carry out her impulse , FREDERIK starts up .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>My God ! How you startled me !<stage>MARTA sets down the tray .</stage>Oh ! To be off and out of this old rat-trap .<stage>He wipes his forehead with his black-bordered handkerchief .</stage>I mean — our loss comes home to us so keenly here where we are accustomed to see him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTA</speaker>
     <p>A cup of coffee , sir ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>No , no , no .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pathetically .</stage>I thought you wished to keep to your uncle 's customs .... He always took it at this time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p><stage>Recovering .</stage>Yes , yes , of course .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTA</speaker>
     <p>No word ?...</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hesitates .</stage>What do you mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTA</speaker>
     <p>No letter ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>Letter ?...<stage>Covering the letter with his hand .</stage>From whom ?...</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTA</speaker>
     <p>From ... At a time like this , I thought ... I felt ... that Annamarie ... that there should be some message .... Every day I expect to hear ...</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>No . PETER gestures to MARTA — pointing to the picture and letter , now covered by FREDERIK 'S hand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MARTA</speaker>
     <p><stage>Hesitating .</stage>Are you certain ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>Quite certain .<stage>She curtsies and leaves the room . FREDERIK , as though relieved to see her go , jumps to his feet , and , tearing the letter in smaller pieces , lights them in the candle , dropping the burning pieces on a tray . As the flame dies out , FREDERIK brushes the blackened paper into the waste-basket .</stage>There 's an end to that ! PETER crouches near the basket — hovering over it , his hinds clasped helplessly . After a pause , he raises his hand , until it points to a bedroom above . An echo of the circus music is very faintly heard ; not with the blaring of brasses , but with the sounds of elfin horns , conveying the impression of a phantom circus band . The door of WILLIAM 'S room opens , and he comes out as though to listen to the music . He wears a sleeping suit and is bare-footed . He has come down stairs before FREDERIK sees him . FREDERIK quickly puts aside the photograph , laying it on the desk , covering it with his hand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gruffly .</stage>Why are n't you in bed ? If you 're ill , that 's the proper place for you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>I came down to hear the circus music .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>Circus music ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>It woke me up .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>The circus left town days ago . You must have been dreaming .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>The band 's playing now . Do n't you hear it , sir ? The procession 's passing .<stage>He runs to the window and opens it . The music stops . A breeze sweeps through the room — bellies out the curtains and causes the lustres to jingle on the mantel . Surprised .</stage>No . It 's almost dark . There 's no procession ... no shining horses ....<stage>Turning sadly away from the window .</stage><stage>Rubbing his eyes .</stage>I wonder what made me think the — I must have been dreaming .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p><stage>Goes to the window , closes it . The child looks at him and , in retreating from him , unconsciously backs towards PETER .</stage>Are you feeling better ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>Yes , sir , I feel better — and hungry .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>Go back to bed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>FREDERIK sits .</stage>Yes , sir .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Where 's your mother , William ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>Do you know where Annamarie is ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Ah !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>Why do you ask me ? What should I know of her ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>Grandmother does n't know ; Miss Catherine does n't know ; nobody knows .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p><stage>Tears up the picture — turning so that WILLIAM does not see what he is doing . PETER , who has been smiling at WILLIAM , motions him to come nearer . WILLIAM , feeling PETER 'S presence , looks round the room .</stage>I do n't know , either .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>Mr. Frederik , where 's old Mr. Grimm ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>Dead .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Puzzled — unable to explain himself , he hesitates .</stage>Are you sure he 's dead ? ‘ Cause —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p><stage>Annoyed ..</stage>You 'd better go to bed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Pointing to a glass of water on a tray .</stage>Can I have a drink of water , please ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>Go to bed , sir , or you 'll be punished . Water 's not good for little boys with fever .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Going towards the stairs .</stage><stage>Goes slowly up the stairs . FREDERIK would destroy the pieces of the picture ; but PETER faces him as though forbidding him to touch it , and , for the first time , FREDERIK imagines he sees the apparition of his uncle .</stage>Wish I could find a cold brook and lie in it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p><stage>In a very low voice — almost inaudibly .</stage><stage>Receding a step and yet another step as the vision of PETER is still before him , he passes out of the room , wiping the beads of sweat from his forehead . WILLIAM , hearing the door close , comes down stairs and , running to the table at back , drinks a glass of water .</stage>My God ! I thought I saw ...</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>Um ! That 's good !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>WILLIAM does n't see PETER yet , but he feels his influence .</stage>William !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>Wish it had been the circus music .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>You shall hear it all again .<stage>Gestures towards the plate of cakes on the tray .</stage>Come , William , here 's something very nice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Seeing the cakes .</stage><stage>He steals to the tray , looking over his shoulder in fear of being caught .</stage>Um ! Cakes !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Do n't be frightened . I 'm here to protect you . Help yourself to the cakes . William , do you think you could deliver a message for me ... a very important message ?... The circus music is heard . WILLIAM sits at the tray and PETER seats himself opposite as though he were the host doing the honours . WILLIAM , being unconsciously coaxed by PETER , is prevailed upon to choose the biggest cake . He takes a bite , looking towards PETER .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>To himself .</stage>Ha !... Think I am dreaming .<stage>Rubbing his little stomach ecstatically .</stage>Hope I wo n't wake up and find there was n't any cake .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Do n't worry , you wo n't .<stage>WILLIAM has taken another piece of cake which he nibbles at — now holding a piece in each hand .</stage>Pretty substantial dream , eh ? There 's a fine , fat raisin .<stage>WILLIAM eats the raisin , then looks into the sugar-bowl .</stage>Do n't hesitate , William . Sugar wo n't hurt you now . Nothing can hurt you any more . Fall to , William — help yourself .<stage>WILLIAM looks over his shoulder , fearing the return of FREDERIK .</stage>Oh , he wo n't come back in a hurry . Ha ! Frederik thought he saw me , William ; well , he did n't . He had a bad conscience — hallucination .<stage>WILLIAM nibbles a lump of sugar .</stage>Now , William , I have a message for you . Wo n't you try and take it for me , eh ?<stage>But WILLIAM eats another lump of sugar .</stage>I see ... I can n't expect to get any assistance from a boy while his little stomach 's calling .<stage>WILLIAM empties the cream jug and helps himself to cakes . Presently the music dies out .</stage>Now I 'm going to tell you something .<stage>Impressively .</stage>You 're a very lucky boy , William ; I congratulate you . Do you know why — of all this household — you are the only one to help me ?... This is the secret : in a little time — it wo n't be long — you 're going —<stage>As though he were imparting the most delightful information .</stage>— to know better ! Think of that ! Is n't the news splendid ?<stage>But WILLIAM eats on .</stage>Think of what most of us have to endure before we know better ! Why , William , you 're going into the circus without paying for a ticket . You 're laying down the burden before you climb the hill . And in your case , William , you are fortunate indeed ; for there are some little soldiers in this world already handicapped when they begin the battle of life .... Their parents have n't fitted them for the struggle .... Like little moon moths ,— they look in at the windows ; they beat at the panes ; they see the lights of happy firesides — the lights of home ; but they never get in .... You are one of these wanderers , William .... And so , it is well for you that before your playing time is over — before your man 's work begins ,— you 're going to know the great secret . Happy boy ! No coarsening of your child 's heart , until you stand before the world like Frederik ; no sweat and toil such as dear old James is facing ; no dimming of the eye and trembling of the hand such as the poor old Doctor shall know in time to come ; no hot tears to blister your eyes , ... tears such as Katie is shedding now ; but , in all your youth , your faith — your innocence ,— you 'll fall asleep and oh ! the awakening , William !... “ It is well with the child . ”<stage>WILLIAM lays down the cake and , clasping his hands , thinks . PETER answers his thoughts .</stage>What ? No — do n't think of it ! Nonsense ! You do n't want to grow up to be a man . Grow up to fail ? Or , still worse — to succeed — to be famous ? To wear a heavy laurel wreath ? A wreath to be held up by tired hands that ache for one hour 's freedom . No , no , you 're to escape all that , William ; joy is on the way to meet you with sweets in its outstretched hands and laughter on its lips .<stage>WILLIAM takes the last swallow of a piece of cake , exclaims “ Hm ! ” in a satisfied way , brushes the crumbs off his lap , and sits back in his chair .</stage>Have you had enough ? Good ! William , I want you to try to understand that you 're to help me , will you ? Will you tell Miss Catherine that —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Without looking up , his hands folded in his lap .</stage>Take me back with you , Mr. Grimm ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Can you see me , William ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>No , sir ; but I know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Come here .<stage>WILLIAM does n't move .</stage>Here ... here ...<stage>WILLIAM advances to the center of the room and pauses hesitatingly .</stage>Take my hand ...<stage>WILLIAM approaches in the direction of the voice . PETER takes WILLIAM 'S outstretched hand .</stage>Have you got it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>No , sir ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Putting his hand on WILLIAM 'S head .</stage>Now ?... Do you feel it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>I feel something , yes , sir .<stage>Puts his hand on PETER 'S hand , which is still on his head .</stage>But where 's your hand ? There 's nothing there .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>But you hear me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>I can n't really hear you .... It 's a dream .<stage>Coaxingly .</stage>Oh , Mr. Grimm , take me back with you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>You 're not quite ready to go with me yet , William — not until we can see each other face to face .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>Why did you come back , Mr. Grimm ? Was n't it nice where you were ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>It was indeed . It was like —<stage>Whimsically .</stage>— new toys .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>To whom the idea appeals .</stage>As nice as that !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Indicating the picture .</stage>Nicer . But I had to come back with this message . I want you to help me to deliver it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>Where 's the bosom of Abraham , Mr. Grimm ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Eh ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>The minister says you 're asleep there .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Stuff and nonsense ! I have n't been near the bosom of Abraham .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>Too bad you died before you went to the circus , Mr. Grimm . But it must be great to be in a place where you can look down and see the circus for nothing . Do you remember the clown that sang : “ Uncle Rat has gone to town ? ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Yes , indeed ; but let us talk of something more important . Come here , William<stage>He starts towards the desk .</stage><stage>PETER is standing at the desk with his finger on the torn pieces of the picture .</stage>; would you like to see someone whom all little boys love — love more than anybody else in the whole world ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>Yes , the clown in the circus .... No ... it is n't a clown ; ... it 's our mother .... Yes , I want to see my mother , Annamarie .<stage>Unconsciously WILLIAM comes to the desk and sees the torn picture — picks up a piece and looks at it . Very simply .</stage>Why ... there she is !... That 's her face .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Ah ! You recognize her . Mother 's face is there , William , but it 's in little bits . We must put her together , William . We must show her to everybody in the house , so that everybody will say : “ How in the world did she ever get here ? To whom does this picture belong ? ” We must set them to thinking .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>Yes . Let us show her to everybody .<stage>He sits and joins the pieces under the guidance of PETER .</stage>Annamarie ... Annamarie ...</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>You remember many things , William ... things that happened when you lived with Annamarie , do n't you ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>I was very little ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Still , you remember ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Evasively .</stage>I was afraid ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>You loved her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>To picture .</stage>Oh , yes ... yes , I loved you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Now , through that miracle of love , you can remember many things tucked away in your childish brain ,— things laid away in your mind like toys upon a shelf . Come , pick them up and dust them off and bring them out again . It will come back . When you lived with Annamarie ... there was you ... and Annamarie ... and —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>— and the other one .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Ah ! We 're getting nearer ! Who was the other one ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gives a quick glance towards the door — then as though speaking to the picture .</stage>I must put you together before he comes back .<stage>He fits the other pieces together — PETER trying to guide him . Presently WILLIAM hums as a child will when at play , singing the tune of “ Uncle Rat . ”</stage>“ Uncle Rat has gone to town . ” PETER and WILLIAM .<stage>Singing together .</stage><stage>At this instant , PETER is indicating another piece of the picture .</stage>“ Ha ! H 'm ! ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Her other foot .</l>
      <stage>Then sings .</stage>
      <l>“ Uncle Rat has gone to town ,</l>
      <l>To buy his niece a wedding gown . ”</l>
      <stage>Adjusting a piece of the picture .</stage>
      <l>Her hand .</l>
      <l>WILLIAM and PETER .</l>
      <stage>Singing .</stage>
      <l>“ Ha ! H 'm ! ”</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>Her other hand .<stage>Sings .</stage>“ What shall the wedding breakfast be ? Hard boiled eggs and — ”<stage>Speaking .</stage><stage>WILLIAM pauses — looking for a piece of the picture .</stage>Where 's —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Finishing the verse .</stage><stage>With a gesture as though knocking on the door of the adjoining room to attract MRS. BATHOLOMMEY 'S attention .</stage>“ A cup of tea . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Speaks .</stage>There 's her hat . WILLIAM and PETER .<stage>Singing .</stage>“ Ha ! H 'm ! ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>Stops singing and claps his hands with boyish delight — staring at the picture .</stage>Annamarie ! Annamarie ! You 're not in bits any more — you 're all put together . By this time , PETER is going up the stairs , and , as he stands in front of CATHERINE 'S door , it opens . PETER passes in and CATHERINE comes out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Astonished .</stage>Why , William ! What are you doing here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>Miss Catherine ! Come down ! Come down ! I have something to show you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Not coming down .</stage><stage>Passes into WILLIAM 'S room .</stage>No , dear — come upstairs ; there 's a good boy . You must n't play down there . Come to bed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. BATHOLOMMEY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Who has entered , and sees WILLIAM ..</stage>William !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>Look — look !<stage>Pointing to the picture .</stage>See what old Mr. Grimm brought back with him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. BATHOLOMMEY</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Alarmed .</stage>
      <l>What are you talking about , William ? Old</l>
      <l>Mr. Grimm is dead .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>No , he is n't ; ... he 's come back .... He has been in this room .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. BATHOLOMMEY</speaker>
     <p>Absurd !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p>I was talking to him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. BATHOLOMMEY</speaker>
     <p>You 're feverish again . I must get the Doctor .<stage>Comes down to WILLIAM .</stage>And I thought you were feeling better !<stage>Seeing CATHERINE , who appears on the balcony as though wondering why WILLIAM does n't come to bed .</stage>The child 's mind is wandering . He imagines all sorts of things . I 'll call the Doctor —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Who has re-entered .</stage>You need n't — he 's coming now . Come in , Andrew . I 'm giving you one more chance . The DOCTOR enters , wearing his skull-cap , and carrying his pipe in his hand . It is evident that he has come over in a hurry .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. BATHOLOMMEY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Surprised .</stage>I was just going for you . How fortunate that you came .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I thought I 'd have another peep at William .</l>
      <l>By this time , CATHERINE has seated herself on a chair , and takes</l>
      <l>WILLIAM on her lap . He puts his arms round her neck .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. BATHOLOMMEY</speaker>
     <p>He 's quite delirious .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>Does n't look it .<stage>Putting his hand on WILLIAM 'S cheek and forehead .</stage><stage>Taking WILLIAM 'S pulse .</stage>Very slight fever . What makes you think he was delirious ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. BATHOLOMMEY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Interrupting .</stage>He said that old Mr. Grimm was in this room — that he was talking to him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Interested .</stage>Yes ? Really ? Well , possibly he is . Nothing remarkable in that , is there ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Well , at last !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. BATHOLOMMEY</speaker>
     <p>What ? Oh , of course , you believe in —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>In fact , I had a compact with him to return if —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. BATHOLOMMEY</speaker>
     <p>A compact ? Of all the preposterous —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>Not at all . Dozens of cases on record — as I can show you — where these compacts have actually been kept .<stage>Suddenly struck — looking at WILLIAM .</stage>I wonder if that boy 's a sensitive .<stage>Hand on his chin .</stage>I wonder ...</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p><stage>Echoing the DOCTOR 'S words .</stage>A sensitive ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. BATHOLOMMEY</speaker>
     <p>What 's that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>It 's difficult to explain . I mean a human organism so constituted that it can be informed or controlled by those who — er — have —<stage>With a gesture .</stage>crossed over .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. BATHOLOMMEY</speaker>
     <p>I think I 'll put the boy to bed , Doctor .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>Just a moment , Mistress Batholommey . I 'm here to find out what ails William . William , what makes you think that Mr. Grimm is in this room ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>MRS. BATHOLOMMEY</speaker>

     <p>Lots of things ...</p>

     <p>Ha !</p>

     <p>You must have seen something .</p>

     <p>The Lord save us — his mother ! I did n't know you 'd heard from Annamarie .</p>

     <p>We have n't .</p>

     <p>Then how 'd that picture get into the house ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Ah ! I knew she 'd begin ! Now that she 's wound up , we shall get at the truth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. BATHOLOMMEY</speaker>
     <p>It 's a new picture . She 's much changed . How ever did it find its way here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>I never saw it before . It 's very strange .... We 've all been waiting for news of her . Even her mother does n't know where she is , or — could Marta have received this since I —</p>

     <p>If not , who had the picture ?... And why were n't we all told ?... Who tore it up ? Did you , William ?<stage>WILLIAM shakes his head , meaning “ No . ”</stage><stage>She pauses — perplexed .</stage>Who has been at the desk ? No one save Frederik ... Frederik ... and surely he —</p>

     <p><stage>Re-entering .</stage>No , Marta has n't heard a word ; and , only a few minutes ago , she asked Frederik if some message had n't come , but he said “ No , nothing . ” I did n't tell her of the picture .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. BATHOLOMMEY</speaker>
     <p>I remember the day that picture came ... the day your uncle died .... It was in a long blue envelope — the size of the picture .... I took it from the postman myself because every one was distracted and rushing about . It dropped to the floor and as I picked it up I thought I knew the writing ; but I could n't remember whose it was .... It was directed to your uncle ....<stage>Looking from the desk to the waste-basket .</stage>There 's the envelope<stage>Holding up a scrap of blue envelope .</stage>and paper ; ... some one has burned it .</p>

     <p>Annamarie wrote to my uncle ...</p>

     <p>If you cannot make your presence known to me — I know there are great difficulties — will you try and send your message by William ? I presume you have one —</p>

     <p>Yes , that 's right .</p>

     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>I 'm going to find out . I 'm going to find out where she is , before I marry you . That child may be right or wrong ; but I 'm going to know what his mother was to you . I want the truth .</p>

     <stage>The third act takes place at twenty minutes to twelve on the same night .</stage>
     <stage>The fire is out . The table on which PETER took his coffee in the first act is now being used by the DOCTOR for WILLIAM 'S medicines , two bottles , two glasses , two teaspoons , a clinical thermometer , &amp; c. WILLIAM , who has been questioned by the DOCTOR , is now asleep upstairs . PETER 'S hat hangs on the peg in the shadow . Although the hour is late , no one has thought of going to bed . FREDERIK is waiting at the hotel for the lawyer whom HICKS was to send to arrange for the sale of PETER GRIMM 'S nurseries , but he has not arrived . The DOCTOR , full of his theories , is seated before the fire , writing the account of PETER GRIMM 'S return , for the American Branch of the “ London Society for Psychical Research . ” It is now a fine , clear night . The clouds are almost silvery and a hint of the moon is showing .</stage>

While he was invisible to all , three people were present besides myself — one of these , a child of eight , who received the message . No spelling out by signals nor automatic writing was employed , but word of mouth . ”<stage>A rap sounds .</stage>Who will that be at this hour ?...<stage>Looks at the clock .</stage>Nearly midnight .<stage>Opening the door .</stage>Yes ?</p>

     <p>Dear , dear ! The scene that took place to-night has completely upset me .<stage>The DOCTOR takes up his pen and reads to himself .</stage>Well , Doctor :<stage>She pushes forward a chair and sits at the other side of the table — facing him .</stage>the breaking off of the engagement is rather sudden , is n't it ? We 've been talking it over in the front parlour , Mr. Batholommey and I. James has finished his work and has just joined us . I suggest sending out a card — a neat card — saying that , owing to the bereavement in the family , the wedding has been indefinitely postponed . Of course , it is n't exactly true .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Goes on reading .</stage>Wo n't take place at all .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. BATHOLOMMEY</speaker>
     <p>Evidently not ; but if the whole matter looks very strange to me — how is it going to look to other people ; especially when we have n't any — any rational explanation — as yet ? We must get out of it in some fashion .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>Whose business is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. BATHOLOMMEY</speaker>
     <p>Nobody 's , of course . But Catherine 's position is certainly unusual ; and the strangest part of it all is — she does n't seem to feel her situation . She 's sitting alone in the library , seemingly placid and happy . What I really wish to consult you about is this : should n't the card we 're going to send out have a narrow black border ?<stage>The DOCTOR is now writing .</stage>Doctor , you do n't appear to be interested . You might at least answer my question .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>What chance have I had to answer ? You 've done all the talking .</p>

     <speaker>MRS. BATHOLOMMEY</speaker>
     <p><stage>Rising — annoyed .</stage>Oh , of course , all these little matters sound trivial to you ; but men like you could n't look after the workings of the next world if other people did n't attend to this . Some one has to do it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>I fully appreciate the fact , Mistress Batholommey , that other people are making it possible for me to be myself . I 'll admit that ; and now if I might have a few moments in peace to attend to something really important —</p>

     <p><stage>Sweeping on .</stage>— theories against the good black of a minister 's coat . I think myself that you have probably stumbled on the truth about William 's mother .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>REV . MR. BATHOLOMMEY</speaker>
     <p>Can it be true ? Oh , dreadful ! Dreadful !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MRS. BATHOLOMMEY</speaker>
     <p>But that child knew it all along . He 's eight years old and he was with her until five — and five 's the age of memory . Every incident of his mother 's life has lingered in his little mind . Supposing you do find her and learn that it 's all true : what do you prove ? Simply that William remembered , and that 's all there is to it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>REV . MR. BATHOLOMMEY</speaker>
     <p>Let us hope that there 's not a word of truth in it . Do n't you think , Doctor — mind , I 'm not opposing your ideas as a clergyman ,— I 'm just echoing what everybody else thinks — do n't you believe these spiritualistic ideas , leading away from the Heaven we were taught to believe in , tend towards irresponsibility — er — eccentricity — and — often — er — insanity ? Is it healthy — that 's the idea — is it healthy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>Well , Batholommey , religion has frequently led to the stake , and I never heard of the Spanish Inquisition being called healthy for anybody taking part in it . Still , religion flourishes . But your old-fashioned , unscientific , gilt , ginger-bread Heaven blew up ten years ago — went out . My Heaven 's just coming in . It 's new . Dr. Funk and a lot of the clergymen are in already . You 'd better get used to it , Batholommey , and get in line and into the procession .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>REV . MR. BATHOLOMMEY</speaker>
     <p>You 'll have to convince me first , Doctor — and that no man can do . I made up my mind at twenty-one , and my Heaven is just where it was then .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOCTOR MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>So I see . It has n't improved a particle .</p>

     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>I think so , my boy . I think several in this house have come to their senses . Catherine has , for one . I 'm very glad to see you back , Frederik . I have a few questions to put to you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>Why do n't you have more light ? It 's half dark in this room .<stage>He picks up the lamp from the DOCTOR 'S table and holds it so that he can look searchingly in the direction of the desk to see if PETER 'S apparition is still there . His eye is suddenly riveted on the telegram resting against the candlestick on the desk .</stage>Is that telegram for me ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>Oh .... It may explain perhaps why I 've been kept waiting at the hotel ....<stage>Tries to go to the desk but cannot muster up courage .</stage>I had an appointment to meet a man who wanted to buy the gardens . I may as well tell you , I 'm thinking of selling out root and branch .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Amazed .</stage>Selling out ? Peter Grimm 's gardens ? So this is the end of Peter 's great work ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>You 'll think it strange , Doctor ; but I — I simply can n't make up my mind to go near that old desk of my uncle 's .... I have a perfect terror of the thing ! Would you mind handing me that telegram ?<stage>The DOCTOR looks at him with scarcely veiled contempt , and hands him the telegram . After a glance at the contents , FREDERIK gives vent to a long-drawn breath .</stage>Billy Hicks — the man I was to sell to — is dead ....<stage>Tosses the telegram across the table towards DR. MACPHERSON , who does not take it . It lies on the table .</stage>I knew it this afternoon ! I knew he would die ... but I would n't let myself believe it . Someone told it to me ... whispered it to me .... Doctor , as sure as you live — somebody else is doing my thinking for me in this house .</p>

     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Studying FREDERIK .</stage>What makes you say that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>To-night — in this room , I thought I saw my uncle ...<stage>Pointing towards the desk .</stage>there .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>Eh ?...</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>And just before I — I saw him — I — I had the ... the strangest impulse to go to the foot of the stairs and call Kitty — give her the house — and run — run — get out of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>Oh , a good impulse , I see ! Very unusual , I should say .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>I thought he gave me a terrible look — a terrible look .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>Your uncle ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>Yes . My God ! I wo n't forget that look ! And as I started out of the room — he blotted out .... I mean — I thought I saw him blot out ; ... then I left the photograph on the desk and —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>That 's how William came by it .<stage>Jots down a couple of notes .</stage>Did you ever have this impulse before — to give up Catherine — to let her have the cottage ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>Not much , I had n't . Certainly not . I told you someone else was thinking for me . I do n't want to give her up . It 's folly ! I 've always been fond of her . But if she has turned against me , I 'm not going to sit here and cry about it . I shall be up and off .<stage>Rising .</stage>But I 'll tell you one thing : from this time , I propose to think for myself . I 've taken a room at the hotel and a few things for the night . I 've done with this house . I 'd like to sell it along with the gardens , and let a stranger raze it to the ground ; but —<stage>Thinks as he looks towards the desk .</stage>when I walk out of here to-night — it 's hers — she can have it . ... I would n't sleep here .... I give her the home because ...</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>Because you do n't believe anything ; but you want to be on the safe side in case he —<stage>Gesturing to desk .</stage>was there .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p><stage>Puzzled — awed — his voice almost dropping to a whisper .</stage>How do you account for it , Doctor ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>It might have been an hallucination or perhaps you did see him , though it could have been inflammation of conscience , Frederik : when did you last see Annamarie ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p><stage>Angrily .</stage>Have n't I told you already that I refuse to answer any questions as to my —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>I think it only fair to tell you that it wo n't make a particle of difference whether you answer me or not . I have someone on the track now — working from an old address ; I 've called in the detectives and I 'll find her , you may be sure of that . As long as I 'm going to know it , I may as well hear your side of it , too . When did you last see Annamarie ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p><stage>Sits — answers dully , mechanically , after a pause .</stage>About three years ago .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>Never since ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>

     <p><stage>Quietly , as before .</stage>What always occurs when a young man realizes that he has his life before him , must be respected — looked up to , settle down , think of his future and forget a silly girl ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>A scene took place , eh ? Was William present ?</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>Yes . She held him in her arms .</p>

     <p>And then ?</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>Nothing . I 'm a rich man now — and if I recognize him — he 'll be at me till the day he dies . His mother 's gone to the dogs and under her influence , the boy —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p>Be silent , you damned young scoundrel . Oh ! What an act of charity if the good Lord took William , and I say it with all my heart . Out of all you have — not a crumb for —</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p>I want you to know I 've sweat for that money , and I 'm going to keep it !</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FREDERIK</speaker>
     <p><stage>Showing feeling .</stage>— Yes ! How do you think I got the money ? I went to jail for it — jail , jail . Every day I 've been in this house has been spent in prison . I 've been doing time . Do you think it did n't get on my nerves ? I 've gone to bed at nine o'clock and thought of what I was missing in New York . I 've got up at cock-crow to be in time for grace at the breakfast table . I took charge of a class in Sabbath-school , and I handed out the infernal cornucopias at the church Christmas tree , while he played Santa Claus . What more can a fellow do to earn his money ? Do n't you call that sweating ? No , sir ; I 've danced like a damned hand-organ monkey for the pennies he left me , and I had to grin and touch my hat and make believe I liked it . Now I 'm going to spend every cent for my own personal pleasure .</p>

     <p>Good-night and good-bye .<stage>With a look of disgust , he has gone to the table , held a medicine bottle to the light to look at the label and poured a spoonful into a wine-glass filled with water .

     <p>I wonder , James , if he can see us now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JAMES</speaker>
     <p>That 's the big mystery !... Who can tell ? But any man who works with flowers and things that grow — knows there is no such thing as death — there 's nothing but life — life and always life . I 'll be back in the morning .... Wo n't you ... see me to the door ?</p>

     <speaker>CATHERINE</speaker>
     <p>Yes ... yes ....<stage>They go up together , CATHERINE carrying a candle into the dark vestibule . The moment they disappear , a lamp standing on the piano goes out as though the draught from the door or an unseen hand had extinguished it . It is now quite dark outside , and the moon is hidden for a moment . At the same time , a light , seemingly coming from nowhere , reveals PETER GRIMM standing in the room at the door — as though he had been there when the young people passed out . He is smiling and happy . The moon is not seen , but the light of it ( as though it had come out from behind a cloud</stage>now reveals the old windmill . From outside the door the voices of JAMES and CATHERINE are heard as they both say :] Good-night .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p>Then good-night to you , my darling : love cannot say good-bye .<stage>She goes to PETER 'S chair , and , sitting , thinks it all over — her hands clasped in her lap — her face radiant with happiness .</stage>Here in your childhood 's home I leave you . Here in the years to come , the way lies clear before you .<stage>His arm upraised .</stage>“ Lust in Rust ” — Pleasure and Peace go with you .<stage>CATHERINE looks towards the door — remembering JAMES ’ kiss — half smiling .</stage><stage>Humorously .</stage>Y — es ; I saw you . I heard ... I know .... Here on some sunny , blossoming day when , as a wife , you look out upon my gardens — every flower and tree and shrub shall bloom enchanted to your eyes .... All that happens — happens again . And if , at first , a little knock of poverty taps at the door , and James finds the road hard and steep — what is money ?— a thing ,— a good thing to have ,— but still a thing ... and happiness will come without it . And when , as a mother , you shall see my plantings with new eyes , my Catherine ,— when you explain each leaf and bud to your little people — you will remember the time when we walked together through the leafy lanes and I taught you — even as you teach them — you little thing !... So , I shall linger in your heart . And some day , should your children wander far away and my gardens blossom for a stranger who may take my name from off the gates ,— what is my name ? Already it grows faint to my ears .<stage>Lightly .</stage>Yes , yes , yes , let others take my work .... Why should we care ? All that happens , happens again .<stage>She rests her elbow on the chair , half hides her face in her hand .</stage>And never forget this : I shall be waiting for you — I shall know all your life . I shall adore your children and be their grandfather just as though I were here ; I shall find it hard not to laugh at them when they are bad , and I shall worship them when they are good — and I do n't want them too good .... Frederik was good .... I shall be everywhere about you ... in the stockings at Christmas , in a big , busy , teeming world of shadows just outside your threshold , or whispering in the still noises of the night .... And oh ! as the years pass ,<stage>Standing over her chair .</stage>you cannot imagine what pride I shall take in your comfortable middle life — the very best age , I think — when you two shall look out on your possessions arm in arm — and take your well-earned comfort and ease . How I shall love to see you look fondly at each other as you say : “ Be happy , Jim — you 've worked hard for this ; ” or James says : “ Take your comfort , little mother , let them all wait upon you — you waited upon them . Lean back in your carriage — you 've earned it ! ” And towards the end —<stage>Sitting on a chair by her side and looking into her face .</stage>after all the luxuries and vanities and possessions cease to be so important — people return to very simple things , dear . The evening of life comes bearing its own lamp . Then , perhaps , as a little old grandmother , a little old child whose bed-time is drawing near , I shall see you happy to sit out in the sunlight of another day ; asking nothing more of life than the few hours to be spent with those you love ,... telling your grandchildren , at your knees , how much brighter the flowers blossomed when you were young . Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! All that happens , happens again .... And when , one glad day , glorified , radiant , young once more , the mother and I shall take you in our arms ,— oh ! what a reunion !<stage>Inspired .</stage>The flight of love — to love .... And now ...<stage>He bends over her and caresses her hand .</stage><stage>CATHERINE rises and , going to the desk , buries her face in the bunch of flowers placed there in memory of PETER .</stage>good-night .</p>

     <p>I wish you the pleasantest dream a little boy can have in this world .

Hai ! ” The sound of the cracking of a whip is heard , and the blare of a clown 's ten-cent tin horn . The phantom voice of the CLOWN<stage>very faint</stage>calls :</p>

     <p>Peanuts , pop-corn , lemonade — ice cold lemo — lemo — lemonade ! Circus day comes but once a year . Breaking in through the music , and the voices of the CLOWN and HAWKER , the gruff voice of a “ BARKER ” is heard calling .</p>
    </sp>

     <speaker>BARKER 'S VOICE</speaker>
     <p>Walk in and see the midgets and the giant ! Only ten cents — one dime ! As these voices die away , the CLOWN , whose voice indicates that he is now perched on the head of the couch , sings : CLOWN 'S VOICE . “ Uncle Rat has gone to town , Ha ! H 'm ! Uncle Rat has gone to town To buy his niece ” — His voice ends abruptly — the music stops . Everything is over . There is silence . Then three clear knocks sound on the door .</p>

     <p>Come in ....<stage>The door opens . No one is there — but a faint path of phosphorous light is seen .</stage>Oh , friends ! Troops of you !<stage>As though he recognizes the unseen guests .</stage>I 've been gone so long that you came for me , eh ? I 'm quite ready to go back . I 'm just waiting for a happy little fellow who 's going back with us .... We 'll follow . Do you all go ahead — lead the way .<stage>He looks at WILLIAM , holds out his arms , and WILLIAM jumps up and runs into them .</stage>Well , William ! You know better now . Come !<stage>Picking up WILLIAM .</stage><stage>WILLIAM nods , his face beaming .</stage>Happy , eh ?</p>

     <speaker>DR. MACPHERSON</speaker>
     <p><stage>Re-entering , goes to the couch with the water , and suddenly , setting down the glass , exclaims in a hushed voice :</stage><stage>He half raises up a boy that appears to be WILLIAM . The light from the lamp on the table falls on the dead face of the child . Then the DOCTOR gently lays the boy down again on the couch , and sits pondering over the mystery of death .</stage>My God ! He 's dead !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>To the DOCTOR .</stage>Oh , no ! There never was so fair a prospect for life !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <p><stage>In PETER 'S arms .</stage>I am happy ! Outside a hazy moonlight shimmers . A few stars twinkle in the far-away sky ; and the low moon is seen back of the old windmill .</p>

     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>To WILLIAM .</stage>If the rest of them only knew what they 're missing , eh ?</p>

     <speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
     <lg>
      <stage>Begins to sing , joyously .</stage>
      <l>“ Uncle Rat has gone to town . ”</l>
      <l>PETER dances up a few steps towards the door , singing with WILLIAM .</l>
      <l>PETER and WILLIAM .</l>
      <l>“ Ha ! H 'm !</l>
      <l>Uncle Rat has gone to town</l>
      <l>To buy his niece a wedding gown .</l>
      <l>Ha ! H 'm ! ”</l>

     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Gives one last fond look towards CATHERINE 'S room . To WILLIAM .</stage>We 're off !<stage>Putting the boy over his shoulder , they sing together , as they go up , the phantom circus music accompanying them .</stage>“ What shall the wedding breakfast be ? Ha ! H 'm ! ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PETER</speaker>
     <p><stage>Alone .</stage>“ What shall the wedding breakfast be ? Hard boiled eggs and a cup of tea . ” WILLIAM and PETER . “ Ha ! H 'm ! ” PETER GRIMM has danced off with the child through the faint path of light . As he goes , the wind or an unseen hand closes the door after them . There is a moment 's pause until their voices are no longer heard — then the curtain slowly descends . The air of the song is taken up by an unseen orchestra and continues as the audience passes out .</p>
