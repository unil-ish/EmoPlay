      <p>The scenery can be made very attractive by both historical accuracy and a display of Oriental luxury , but the drama may easily be performed with simple means at a small cost without losing its dramatic effect . Some of the changes , however , should be very rapid . The interludes can be replaced by lantern slide pictures , or may be omitted . If the interludes are retained there need not be any intermission in the whole drama .</p>

        <lg>
         <l>My son Siddhattha truly loves his wife ,</l>
         <l>And since their wedlock has been blessed by this</l>
         <l>Sweet , promising , this hale and healthy child ,</l>
         <l>His melancholy will give way to joy ,</l>
         <l>And we reclaim his noble energies</l>
         <l>To do good service for our race and state .</l>
         <l>New int'rests and new duties give new courage</l>
         <l>And thus this babe will prove his father 's saviour</l>
         <l>For he will tie his soul to life again .</l>
        </lg>
       </sp>
       <sp>

        <p>I fear his grief lies deeper than you think .</p>

        <p>What sayest thou , my trusty counselor ?</p>

        <speaker>V</speaker>
        <lg>
         <l>This is the last hope which I have for him ,</l>
         <l>I followed your advice and tried all means</l>
         <l>To cure Siddhattha of his pensive mood .</l>
         <l>I taught him all that will appeal to man :</l>
         <l>The sports of youth , the joy of poetry</l>
         <l>And art , the grandeur of our ancient lore ,</l>
         <l>The pleasures e'en of wanton sense ; but naught</l>
         <l>Would satisfy the yearnings of his heart .</l>

       <sp>
        <speaker>S</speaker>
        <lg>
         <l>Yet for religion he shows interest :</l>

       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>V</speaker>
        <lg>
         <l>Indeed he ponders on life 's meaning much ,</l>
         <l>Investigates the origin of things</l>
         <l>But irreligious are his ways of thought .</l>
         <l>He shows no reverence for Issara ,</l>
         <l>And Indra is to him a fairy tale .</l>
         <l>He grudgeth to the gods a sacrifice</l>
         <l>And sheddeth tears at immolated lambs .</l>
         <l>Oh no ! he 's not religious . If he were ,</l>
         <l>His ills could easily be cured by faith ,</l>
         <l>By confidence in Issara , the Lord .</l>

        <lg>
         <l>Siddhattha is a youth of rarest worth ,</l>
         <l>And he surpasseth men in every virtue</l>
         <l>Except in one .— He is too independent :</l>
         <l>He recognizeth no authority ,</l>
         <l>Neither of men nor gods . He suffereth</l>
         <stage>More and more impressively</stage>
         <l>From the incurable disease of thought .</l>

        <speaker>S</speaker>
        <lg>
         <l>Cure thought with thought , teach him philosophy ,</l>

        <lg>
         <l>My lord , I did , but he is critical ,</l>
         <l>He makes objections and will not believe .</l>
         <l>He raises questions which I cannot answer ,</l>
         <l>And his conclusions are most dangerous .</l>

        <lg>
         <l>It seems to me that you exaggerate ;</l>
         <l>Siddhattha is not dangerous . He is</l>
         <l>As gentle as my sister was , his mother ,</l>
         <l>And almost overkind to every one .</l>

         <l>I doubt it :</l>
         <l>Your son , my Lord , not only hath no faith</l>
         <l>In holy writ , neither does he believe</l>
         <l>In caste-distinction , and he would upset</l>
         <l>The sanctioned order of our institutions .</l>
         <l>He would abolish sacrifice and holdeth</l>
         <l>The Brahman ritual in deep contempt .</l>

        <lg>
         <l>Rightly so ; I fear</l>
         <l>That he will stir the people to rebellion ;</l>
         <l>But since a child is born to him , his mind</l>
         <l>May turn from dreams to practical affairs .</l>
         <l>There are some men who care not for themselves ,</l>
         <l>Who scorn high caste , position , wealth and honor ,</l>
         <l>So far as they themselves may be concerned ,</l>
         <l>But they are anxious for their children 's fortune ,</l>
         <l>And so Siddhattha soon may change his views .</l>

         <l>Keep everything unpleasant out of sight ,</l>
         <l>Invite him merry company . Remove</l>
         <l>His gloomy cousin Devadatta . He tries</l>
         <l>To reach a state of bliss by fasts ,</l>
         <l>His very play is penance and contrition .</l>

         <l>Neither is he the right friend for my son .</l>
         <l>I grant he has a loving disposition ,</l>
         <l>But he is pensive too . Surround Siddhattha</l>
         <l>With lads such as the gardner 's jolly son ,</l>
         <l>Kala Udayin . Like a lark he warbles !</l>
         <l>Would there were more like him . He jokes and laughs</l>
         <l>And never makes a sullen face . But tell me</l>

        <p><stage>with concern</stage>Have him removed from here ; Siddhattha likes him much and if he knew Udayin 's sorry fate , it might undo All good effects of joyful fatherhood .</p>

        <p>My Lord , you have no ambition to be a king ; you think the world is full of vanity , and you consider that life and its glory will pass away . That is exactly what I think . I agree with you . Only , you are of a serious disposition and take the matter to heart , while I think it is great fun . What is the use of thinking so much . We are all like bubbles : we float in the air , and then the bubble bursts and this life is over . I am now a poor boy . I fear no change . In a future incarnation I may be born as the son of a king , like you . And think of it , after a few million years , this whole world , this big bulky stupid institution , this home of so many villains , and a couple of good ones like us two among them , the theater of rascalities , of vanities , of follies , will be scattered to the winds , as if it had never existed . Be merry , my Prince , so long as the comedy lasts . DEVADATTA<stage>Dd .</stage>appears in the background . His cheeks are sunken and his face is gloomy . His eye has a fanatic expression .</p>

        <p>O Prince Siddhattha , do not go into homelessness , do not leave us . I cannot live without you . You are my comfort , my teacher , my guide . I do not follow your instructions , but I love to hear them . Oh I could not live without you . Do not go , sweet Prince . Think of your wife , your dear good lovely wife , it will break her heart . Think of your child . Do not go , noble Prince . Let somebody else become the saviour of the world . Somebody else can just as well become the deliverer and the Buddha . I am sure there are many who would like to fill that place , and somebody can do it who has a less comfortable home to leave , who has a less lovely wife , who is not heir to a kingdom , and who has not such a sweet promising little boy as you have . I cannot live without you .</p>

        <p>The Prince loves flowers , and he knows them all by name ; he loves trees and shrubs , and praises them for yielding fruit and grain for feeding us without the need of shedding blood .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>S</speaker>
        <p>Double the guards at the gate . I am afraid my son will flee . It would be a disgrace on my house to have him become a mendicant . The kings of Kosala , of Magadha , and all the others look with envy on our sturdy people ; they dislike our free institutions and our warlike spirit . They would scoff at us if a Sakya prince had become a monk . But if Siddhattha does flee , I swear by Lord Indra that I shall disown him ; I will no longer recognize him as my son . I will disinherit him and make Rahula my heir apparent . VISAKHA looks at SUDDHODANA in amazement .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>S</speaker>
        <p>I am serious and I will do it . I swore an oath , and Issara will help me to keep it . Now go to the captain of the guards and do as I bid you .</p>

       <stage>Exit . The Minister alone .</stage>
       <sp>
        <speaker>V</speaker>
        <p>Oh ! What a chance for me ! Siddhattha will flee , if he be not prevented ; he will be disinherited . Rahula is a babe , and it will take twenty years before he grows up to manhood .—<stage>He muses .</stage>I may proceed on different lines , and one of them must certainly lead to success . I may marry the Princess and become the stepfather of the heir apparent , his guardian , the man who has him in his power — Hm ! Hm ! I need not plan too far ahead . And if that plan did not work , the King of Magadha would make me raja of the Sakyas , if I would recognize him as my liege . The full moon rises and the scene becomes gradually brighter . VISAKHA knocks at the gate . Who is on guard ? Officer comes out .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>V</speaker>
        <p>‘ Tis well . King Suddhodana requests you to double your guard to-night , for he has reasons . Further he wants you to remove the corpse of Udayin , the gardener who died to-day of an infectious disease . Be on your guard , for where a dead body lies there are ghosts — and<stage>in a half whisper</stage>when you see demons or gods , keep yourselves , you and your men , locked up in the guard house , and the spook will pass without harm .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>D</speaker>
        <p>Your order shall be punctiliously obeyed . Pays his military salute and returns to the guard house .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>V</speaker>
        <p>That settles the guard , and should Siddhattha flee he will find no obstacle . Two men come out of the guard house and enter the palace with a bier . KALA UDAYIN comes back from the garden . VISAKHA retires into the background .</p>

        <p>The nightingale is a sweet bird , but I like the lark better . The nightingale is more artistic , but his song is melancholy , he is so sentimental ! The lark has a mere twitter like my own song , I like the lark better . How beautiful is this summer night ; How glorious is the moon ; how fragrant are the roses in the garden ! It is a most auspicious night , and all breathes happiness . VISAKHA from his hiding place watches KALA .</p>

        <p><stage>while the music plays</stage>What a strange presentiment is stealing over my soul . Perhaps I was too happy ! What does Siddhattha say ? “ All conformations always are transient ,<stage>A</stage>Harrassed by sorrow , lacking a self . ”<stage>Footnote A : The quoted lines run in the same rhythm as the melody and should be pronounced accordingly . See Buddhist Hymns , p. 22 .</stage>The men come with the corpse on the bier . KALA stops them .</p>

        <speaker>K</speaker>
        <p>Oh , my Prince ! See here ! My father is dead ! Now I know the truth as well as you . Now I feel the pain . The time has come for me to lament . I was so happy and I would not believe you .— Oh ye who are happy , think in the hour of happiness that all is subject to suffering , and the hour of suffering will come to you too . Nay more than that , the hour of death will come ; it has come to my father , it will come to you and to me , and then my caroling will stop forever . Oh , my poor father !</p>

        <speaker>B</speaker>
        <p>How rarely is thy advent welcome , Death , E'en this poor gardener who a servant was His livelong days , leaves in our hearts a gap . His son lamenteth him , and I not less ; He was my loving friend ; my educator , He had me on his knees so many a time , To tell me how the flowers will grow and blow , And how they prosper after rainy days . May gentle lilies from thy ashes spring , Decked with the purity of thine own heart , And with their fragrance give the same delight That in thy present life thou gavest us . The carriers lift up the body and carry it out . Oh , fare thee well , thou good and worthy friend , Oh , fare thee well , but thy departure is To me a token that my time has come . Turning to KALA who all the while was lying prostrate weeping . Weep not , companion of my childhood days , But bear in mind the courage of thy mirth . Remember all the virtues of thy father And let them live again in thine own heart . Thou must not yield to weakness and lamenting , Tend to life 's duties : Go and call me Channa , Bid him to saddle Kanthaka , my steed , And let him ready be for a night 's ride .</p>

      <stage>Tradition tells that King Bimbisara , hearing of the noble monk , went out to see him and offered him to take part in the government . This being refused , the King requested him to visit Rajagaha , the royal residence , as soon as Siddhattha had become a Buddha .</stage>

         <l>He stirred the courage of his followers</l>

         <l>I have a matter to bespeak with you ,</l>
         <l>Far-reaching weighty plans of great importance .</l>
         <l>I wish to be alone with you .</l>
         <l>Turning to the captain of his body guards .</l>
         <l>Captain , have this room guarded by your soldiers .</l>
         <l>The gong shall call you when I need your service .</l>
         <l>The soldiers march out of the room .</l>
         <l>Be seated , my good lords .</l>
         <l>You helped me gain a wondrous victory</l>
         <l>Which proves I have the favor of the gods .</l>
         <l>I probed your skill , your courage and your faith</l>
         <l>And found you both most able and most trusty .</l>
         <l>Therefore you are to me much more than vassals</l>
         <l>And servants of the state ; you are my helpers ,</l>
         <l>Indeed my friends and nearest to my heart .</l>
         <l>A king needs friends who share his secret thoughts ,</l>
         <l>Who stand by him in all vicissitudes ,</l>
         <l>Who bear with him responsibilities ,</l>

         <l>I , my dear friends , I promise you in turn</l>
         <l>That I shall not resent your words of truth</l>
         <l>If spoken in good faith with best intentions .</l>
         <l>I may not always follow your advice ,</l>
         <l>But you are free to say whate'er you please ,</l>
         <l>Whate'er you may deem best for me to know ,</l>
         <l>Whate'er will benefit the empire and my people .</l>
         <l>Now listen what I have to say to you .</l>
         <l>I will reveal to you my inmost heart :</l>
         <l>This is an age of greatest expectations ;</l>
         <l>Riches accumulate in our cities ,</l>
         <l>Commerce and trade are flourishing , and</l>
         <l>Our caravans exchange our native goods</l>
         <l>For gold and precious produce from abroad .</l>
         <l>What India needs is unity of rule .</l>
         <l>The valley of the holy Ganges should</l>
         <l>Be governed by one king , a king of kings .</l>
         <l>There should no longer be a rivalry ,</l>
         <l>A clash of interests between the states ,</l>
         <l>And all the princes should obey the rule</l>
         <l>Of the one man who guides and guards the whole .</l>
         <l>This therefore is my plan : you Nagadeva</l>
         <l>Must gain the favor of our neighbor kings ,</l>
         <l>So as to make them recognize our sway .</l>
         <l>If voluntarily they will submit ,</l>
         <l>They shall be welcome as our worthy vassals .</l>
         <l>If they resist</l>
         <stage>turning to Siha</stage>
         <l>my gallant general</l>
         <l>You must reduce them to subjection .</l>
         <l>A treaty with the rajas in the east ,</l>
         <l>In southern and in northern Kosala ,</l>
         <l>Speedeth my plans , the Sakyas only</l>
         <l>Defy our sovereign will , and keep aloof .</l>
         <l>If they yield not , their power must be broken !</l>
         <l>There is a task for you and for my army .</l>

         <l>I know the Sakya minister of state ,</l>
         <l>And he is willing to betray his master .</l>
         <l>The Sakya prince , the only son and heir ,</l>
         <l>Siddhattha Gotama he 's called by name ,</l>
         <l>Went into homelessness and has turned monk ,</l>
         <l>Leaving behind his wife and a small son .</l>
         <l>The minister aspireth to the throne ,</l>
         <l>And if we help him in his plans , he will</l>
         <l>Acknowledge you as sovereign over him .</l>
         <l>And that will save your army blood and trouble .</l>

They rise also . The world is growing wider every day And our souls broaden with the general progress . A new era dawns upon us . Let us all Help to mature the fruitage of the times .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>K</speaker>
        <p>Could you help him , princess ? He might not like it , and the monks abhor women . Moreover , I was told that he takes food again , every morning a cup of rice milk . The day I left he looked better . Still , he was pretty pale .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>Y</speaker>
        <p>Tell me all you know of him .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>K</speaker>
        <p>I went first to Rajagaha , and there I heard wondrous tales about the noble monk Gotama . All the people knew about him , they called him a “ sage ” or “ muni ” and the “ Bodhisatta . ”</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>R</speaker>
        <p>What does that mean , Kala ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>K</speaker>
        <p>Bodhisatta is the man who seeks the bodhi — and the bodhi is enlightenment or Buddhahood .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>Y</speaker>
        <p>What did the people of Rajagaha say ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>K</speaker>
        <p>When Prince Siddhattha came to Rajagaha , he created a great excitement in the city . Never had been seen a mendicant of such noble appearance , and crowds flocked to him . They thought he was a Buddha and greeted him as a Buddha ; but he said to them “ I am not a Buddha ; I am a Bodhisatta , I seek Buddhahood , and I am determined to find it . ”</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>Y</speaker>
        <p>Did you meet people who saw him ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>K</speaker>
        <p>Indeed , I did . They say he looked like a god . The news spread all over the capital , and King Bimbisara himself went out with his ministers to see the Bodhisatta . King Bimbisara came to the place where the stranger stayed — under a forest tree near a brook — and greeted him most respectfully saying , “ Great monk , remain here with me in Rajagaha ; I see that you are wise and worthy . Live with me at the royal palace . Be my adviser and counselor . You are not made for a mendicant . Your hands are fit to hold the reins of empire . Stay here , I beg you , and you shall not lack honor and rank . ” “ Nay , ” replied Siddhattha , “ let me go my way in quest of enlightenment . I am bent on solving the problem of existence , and I will become a Buddha . ” Said the King , “ Hear then , great monk . Go in quest of enlightenment , and when you have found it come back to Rajagaha . ”</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>Y</speaker>
        <p>Is King Bimbisara so religious ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>K</speaker>
        <p>King Bimbisara is ambitious . As is well known , he is a warrior and a conqueror ; but that is not all . He wants to be the greatest monarch of all ages and he would have all the great events happen under his rule . This is what he said to the Bodhisatta : “ When I was a youth I uttered five wishes , and they were these : I prayed , May I be crowned King . This wish has been fulfilled . Then I wished , May the holy Buddha , the Blessed One , appear on earth while I am King , and may he come to my kingdom . This was my second wish , and while I gaze upon you I know that it will be fulfilled . Further I wished , May I see the blessed Buddha and pay my respects to him . This was my third wish . My fourth wish was , May the Blessed One preach the doctrine to me , and my fifth and greatest wish was this , May I understand the doctrine . I beg you , therefore , great monk , when you have become a Buddha come back and preach the doctrine to me and accept me as your disciple . ”</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>Y</speaker>
        <p>And whither did Siddhattha go from Rajagaha ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>K</speaker>
        <p>He visited the great philosophers Arada and Udraka , but he found no satisfaction in their theories . So he went on to Uruvela where the ascetics live . I followed the Bodhisatta and learned that he stayed with five disciples in the forest . I found shelter near by in the cottage of the chief shepherd , a good old man with a pretty daughter , Nanda . There I watched Siddhattha and his disciples from a distance . He was the youngest but the wisest of them , and they reverenced him as master . He outdid them all in fasting . One day Nanda , the shepherd 's daughter , saw him faint , and he might have died from exhaustion right on the spot if Nanda had not given him rice milk to drink .</p>

        <speaker>Y</speaker>
        <p>O good Kala , what shall I do ? What shall I do ? Here I sit at home , a poor , helpless woman , unable to assist him or to take care of him ! O Kala , advise me , what can I do ? KING SUDDHODANA<stage>S</stage>and VISAKHA<stage>V</stage>come out of the palace . The Princess retires into the palace . GOPA hides behind the bushes .</p>

        <p>And has Siddhattha succeeded ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>K</speaker>
        <p>It does not seem so ; he is starving himself to death .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>V</speaker>
        <p>Is he dying ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>K</speaker>
        <p>Not exactly , but I do not see how he can live — on that diet .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>S</speaker>
        <p>Oh , Visakha , how have I been deprived of my son through a whim ! Both return into the palace . VISAKHA comes back .</p>
       </sp>

        <speaker>V</speaker>
        <p>It seems that Siddhattha is ruining himself .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>K</speaker>
        <p>At the rate he is going now , he wo n't stand it long . He may not live another month . It is pitiable . You should have seen him . That beautiful young man looks like a consumptive in his last stage . I did not dare to tell what I thought . The Princess would not have borne the sad news .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>V</speaker>
        <p>Too bad . It looks pretty hopeless .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>K</speaker>
        <p>I do not see how the Prince can survive .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>V</speaker>
        <p>What is the idea of these fasts ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>K</speaker>
        <p>These pious recluses believe that the self is imprisoned in the body and that the senses are the prison gates . They want to liberate the soul , and many of them behold visions , but Siddhattha seems to doubt whether the saints of Uruvela proceed on the right track . Indeed he denies the very existence of the self .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>V</speaker>
        <p>I know he does . His views should be branded as purely human wisdom . As the senses are finger touch , eye touch , ear touch , nose and tongue touch , so the mind is to him mere thought touch . He claimed that the mind originates through a co-operation of the senses .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>K</speaker>
        <p>His disciples begin to break away from him .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>V</speaker>
        <p>That is right . They ought to have done so long ago . I always said that Siddhattha is an unbeliever . He spurns faith and relies too much on his own observation and reasoning . He will never find enlightenment . He is too negative , too nihilistic , and his quest of Buddhahood will end in a lamentable failure .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>K</speaker>
        <p>It would be a pity , sir . He is certainly in earnest to find the truth — the real truth , not what the priests say nor the Vedas declare , but the truth , provable truth .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>V</speaker>
        <p>Yes that is his fault . When the king speaks with you tell him all , explain the hopelessness of his situation . The king ought to know the facts . VISAKHA retires into the palace .</p>

        <p>Pshaw ! Mankind consists of different castes and professions , of soldiers and merchants , of peasants and artisans and teachers . Mankind is like a body with various limbs , a head and hands , feet and chest and neck . A man who were head only could not live , and if mankind consisted of Buddhas only we would starve . We need a Buddha , but there must also be householders . Now quick give me a kiss . She pouts .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>K</speaker>
        <p>If you do not kiss me I shall go back to the forest of Uruvela . Nanda , the shepherd 's daughter , is a very pretty girl . She is as pretty as you are . She is ,— well , her cheeks are rosier than yours . She is a little taller , and she is so graceful when she milks the kine . The shepherd needs a helper .

        <p>I knew she would come around ,— and she is much prettier than Nanda . Nanda is a buxom country lass , a pleasant girl , but Gopa is as proper as a princess .<stage>He continues with unction .</stage>Bodhisatta longs for the blessed state of Nirvana , and when he has found it , he will be calm and without passion . He will walk on earth as a god among men . No emotion will disturb the peace of his mind , and the happiness of the great Brahma will be as nothing in comparison to the infinite bliss of his Buddhahood .<stage>With a lighter tone</stage>I adore him , but I do not envy him . I do not long for the happiness of a god . I am a man with human faults and human yearnings . I am satisfied with the happiness and the sufferings of a man . Since I am assured of Gopa 's love , I care not for Nirvana . I think that this world is good enough for me .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>Y</speaker>
        <p>No , Rahula , I send Kala Udayin out to watch him and when Kala comes back he tells me what he saw and heard . Kala does not speak to father .</p>

        <p>Grandfather forbade him . When we sent out Devadatta and Ananda , they became attached to the life of a hermit . They joined father and did not come back ; but Kala will not turn monk .</p>

        <p>It means that we are not separate beings . I think a thought and speak it out and you hear it . I believe in that thought and so do you . Whose is it then , yours or mine ?</p>

       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>Y</speaker>
        <p>But where does the thought come from ? If it is true it belongs to the truth , and it was true before I thought it .</p>

No one saves us but ourselves , No one can and no one may . We ourselves must walk the path , Buddhas merely teach the way . The boy sleeps .

        <p>I will not suffer thee to stay , Siddhattha , And shall disturb thy daring quest of truth . I 'll split the Bodhi tree by lightning And frighten thee away with rumbling thunder . All is wrapped in darkness , except SIDDHATTHA and the Bohdi tree . Thunder and lightning . After a while the noise abates . It grows light again . MARA 'S daughters appear .</p>

        <speaker>M</speaker>
        <p>Go forth my daughters , tempt the holy man , And lure him from the seat of Buddahood . Three graceful women , MARA 'S daughters , sing in a low enticing voice .<stage>Melody : The Mermaids ’ Song from Weber 's Oberon .</stage>Sweetest on earth ‘ tis in pleasure to live , Love thou must ask for , and love thou must give . Pain we can soothe and assuage every smart , Yea , we will grant thee the wish of thy heart . Power bestow we , enjoyment and mirth , Health and wealth also , and all that has worth . Lo , of life 's happiness naught shalt thou miss , Satisfied longings are greatest of bliss . While they sing they circle around the Bodhi tree and pose in graceful attitudes .</p>
       </sp>
       <stage>Siddhattha does not mind Mara 's daughters . They withdraw , and grotesque monsters appear in threatening attitudes , exhibiting a savage war dance , always approaching the tree and turning their weapons against the Sakyamuni , but as soon as they approach the halo they droop , unable to hurt him . Lotus flowers rain down . Sakyamuni raises his right hand . A flash of lightning and a sudden clap of thunder . The spook vanishes in darkness while the Buddha under the Bodhi tree alone remains visible in a halo of light . The forest landscape reappears in full light as before .</stage>

        <p>The wheel of life turns round through birth and death , Its twelve-linked chain of causes takes its start In ignorance and ends in suffering . The truth is found , the fourfold noble truth ; All life is sorrow , sorrow 's cause is lust , But from our sorrow we can escape If we abandon lust and thought of self . The eightfold noble path of righteousness Delivers from all evil : it will bring Sweet peace of mind and leadeth to Nirvana .<stage>With music accompaniment</stage>Through many births I sought in vain The builder of this house of pain .

      <head type="act">Third Act .</head>
      <head>1 . THE FOUNDATION OF THE KINGDOM OF RIGHTEOUSNESS .</head>
      <stage>Buddha preaches to his five disciples the way of salvation , which speech , preserved in a special book , is frequently compared to Christ 's Sermon on the Mount .</stage>
      <stage>Buddha stands with raised hand , while five monks stand or sit or squat around him in devout attitude .</stage>
      <p>2 . ENTERING THE CAPITAL .</p>
      <stage>When Buddha came to Rajagaha , the people met him on the way and accompanied him into the city in triumphal procession which is analogous to Christ 's entry into Jerusalem .</stage>
      <stage>The Buddha with bowl in one hand and staff in the other is followed by yellow-robed monks . The people strew flowers , carry palm branches and wave kerchiefs .</stage>
      <p>3 . THE COURTESAN .</p>
      <stage>Ambapali , the Buddhist Mary Magdalen , came to Buddha , worshiping him and invited him to take his meal at her home . To the astonishment of several moralists , he accepted and honored the penitent sinner .</stage>
      <stage>A beautifully dressed woman with clasped hands kneels before Buddha , a maid in attendance behind her . Some well dressed people of high caste watch the scene with an expression of indignation .</stage>
      <p>4 . THE PHILANTHROPIST .</p>
      <stage>The wealthiest man of Savatthi invites the Buddha to his home and offers to build a resthouse for the Buddha and his brotherhood .</stage>
      <stage>Anatha Pindika kneels before the Buddha , holding in one hand the picture and plan of a building . Buddha indicates by his lowered hand acceptance of the gift . Buddha attended by two monks , Anatha Pindika accompanied by the architect .</stage>
      <p>5 . PRINCE JETA .</p>
      <stage>It is told that the most beautiful spot in Savatthi was the royal park of Prince Jeta , which Anatha Pindika wanted to buy for the brotherhood of Buddha . The owner was unwilling to sell and made the exorbitant demand to have the whole ground covered with gold as its price . But Anatha Pindika had the gold carried to the garden and paid the price .</stage>
      <stage>The scene is laid in the garden . Anatha Pindika with bags of gold stands in commanding attitude . His servants spread the coins while Prince Jeta throws up his hands in astonishment .</stage>
      <stage>( Anatha Pindika is not the real name of the founder of the Jetavana . The name means , “ [ He who gives to ] the indigent , alms . ” )</stage>

      <div type="scene" n="1">
       <head type="scene">FIRST SCENE</head>
       <stage>A Brahman temple with a statue of Durga ; before the idol an altar . In the background a landscape with farms and a sheep-fold .</stage>
       <stage>Enter from the right GENERAL SIHA ( GS . ) with a CAPTAIN ( C ) and some soldiers .</stage>

        <speaker>GS</speaker>
        <p>Pitch the tents on the slope of yonder hill where that farmhouse stands .</p>

        <p>It shall be done , my general .</p>

        <p>What crowd is gathered there with flags and flowers ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>C</speaker>
        <p>It is the farmer 's family led by the village priest , and neighbors flock around to swell their number .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>GS</speaker>
        <p>The priest handles a big knife that flashes in the sun . I see his hands are stained with gore . They seem to celebrate a feast in honor of a god .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>C</speaker>
        <p>The villagers inform me that the occasion of it is sad . One of the farmer 's children died of late , and others being sick the father invokes the goddess Kali to preserve the rest of his family . They are arrayed for a procession and having offered a young sheep at the altar of the homestead they have started out . See how the crowd are wending their way hither to the temple . GENERAL SIHA looks around and contemplates the scenery , then turns to the CAPTAIN .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>GS</speaker>
        <p>Now pitch the tents before the sun goes down . In the meantime , the BUDDHA enters with two disciples . They sit down under a tree . The Captain bows to them reverently and leaves the stage .</p>

        <p>When I chose my profession I prayed to the gods that they would never let it be my lot to fight for any unjust cause .</p>

        <lg>
         <l>I teach the middle way between extremes .</l>
         <l>Neither mortifications of the body</l>
         <l>Nor self-indulgence should be practised .</l>
         <l>We must make up our minds and walk</l>

        <p>Blessed be this day on which I meet the greatest man of our age . I heard of thee from the Nirgranthas , thine own enemies , the rival sect of thy new order , and they say that thou deniest the soul , thou teachest extinction , thou leadest man to non-existence , and that Nirvana is with thee an empty naught — annihilation .— Is that true ?</p>

         <l>On doing what is right and just and good ;</l>
         <l>On doing resolutely what we do ,</l>
         <l>On searching for the truth , on setting up</l>
         <l>Its lamp and following its holy light .</l>
         <l>Nirvana is attained when passions are</l>
         <l>Extinct and when the heart is blessed with peace .</l>

        <speaker>GS</speaker>
        <p>Thou art more than a mortal , holy man . Auspicious is this day on which I 've met thee . The people call thee Buddha , perhaps rightly so ! A feeling of deep reverence comes over me and the truth dawns on me . Truly thou art the teacher of the world . If thy doctrine impressed the people a new era would begin , an era in which mankind would be wiser and nobler , happier and better .<stage>Barbaric music is heard behind the stage , the drum being prominent .</stage>Voices behind the stage : Maha Kali ! Kali Ma !</p>

       <stage>The procession enters . A small band of musicians comes with primitive instruments , among them drums . They are followed first by dancers , then by a priest ( Pr . ) flourishing in his bloody hand a large knife . By his side walks a shepherd carrying a lamb . Behind them the farmer 's ( F .) family and other people</stage>

       </sp>
       <stage>The priest steps to the altar ; the crowd kneels in a large circle . At the priest 's signal the farmer approaches the altar and kneels . His behavior betrays superstitious timidity and great awkwardness . The shepherd exhibits the lamb first to the priest and then to the dancers who in fantastic dancing step advance and retreat while the music plays . Finally the lamb is placed on the altar .</stage>
       <sp>
        <speaker>Pr</speaker>

       <stage>The shepherd takes up the lamb and stands ready to carry it away . The musicians slink away . The lambbearers and the people walk off in procession , followed by the Buddha with his disciples . General Siha remains alone on the stage . A trumpet call at a short distance and another one close by .</stage>

        <p>What does that signal mean ? An officer accompanied by a trumpeter enters . A third trumpet call on the stage . The officer delivers a letter .</p>

        <p>Breaks the seal and reads to himself . “ The Sakyas are a stubborn little nation . Their institutions are free ; their laws differ from those of the other surrounding states . These people are a source of discontent and revolution , and are a sore in my eye . Therefore , the Sakyas must be crushed , even if they sue for peace . Keep the army near the border and be ready for a sudden attack . ” With an expression of grief . War is unavoidable and I am to be the means by which the Sakyas will be wiped off the earth . It is my duty , for the King commands it . A soldier should not argue , he obeys . Draws his sword and looks at it . This sword is consecrated to the service of my king . Never have I drawn it except in honest fight . Lost in contemplation . Is Sakyamuni the Buddha ?— Is he truly the Buddha ? Buddhas are wise ; Buddhas are omniscient ; Buddhas foresee the future .— Is Sakyamuni truly the Buddha ?— I believe he is . And if he is the Buddha , is it right to wage a war against his people ?— What shall I do ? Oh , ye gods , teach me my duty ! Oh , ye gods , may it not be my lot to fight for an unrighteous cause ! Cursed be the sword that sheds innocent blood .</p>

There are another fifty thousand within call to make a sudden dash upon any of our neighbors should they dare come to the aid of Sakya . Our treasury is well filled , and the people of Magadha are prosperous . We could stand even a protracted war far better than any other state in India .</p>

        <speaker>Dd</speaker>
        <p>No longer , mighty King , I was his disciple so long as I believed in him ; but he is not holy . I have abandoned him . He is not austere ; his disciples do not practise self-mortifications , and he speaks kindly and dines with sinners . My disciples do not dress in worldly garments ; they would not accept the invitation of women ; they would not touch animal food . He who calls himself the Buddha is unworthy of that high title ; he is a pretender who has not reached the highest goal . My rules are much more strict than his , and my brotherhood alone is holy .</p>

He may be holy , but he is treacherous . He may be virtuous ; he may shun joy and the blessings of life , he may practise all penances , he may torture and mortify his body .

Support his brotherhood with money or gifts as you see fit , but do not believe what he says about the Buddha .</p>

        <p><stage>With an inquiring look</stage>Why ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>Ap</speaker>
        <p>I know what he meant when he scoffed at him . When the Buddha stayed at Vesali , I invited that noblest of all monks to take his meal with me . I am not holy ; I am a worldly woman ; I am not a saint ; but I have a warm heart , I feel for others and I want to do what is right . When I heard that the Buddha stayed in the mango grove , I thought to myself , I will go and see him . If he is truly all-wise , he will judge my heart and he will judge me in mercy . He will know my needs and will not refuse me . I went to the mango grove and he looked upon me with compassion ; he accepted my invitation in the presence of witnesses , openly , fearlessly , and in kindness . There were the proud Licchavi princes , and close to him stood the envious Devadatta . How they scowled ; how they condemned the great and kindly saint ! How they whispered , “ Shame on him ! ” and I saw how they despised me — yet they did not dare to speak out or to censure him publicly . Then , my gracious King , I knew that he was truly the Lord Buddha , the Allwise .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>Bb</speaker>
        <p>My dear friend , I accept every word you say as true . I know the goodness of your heart , I know your worth , your loving kindness , and if you were of royal birth you would be worthy to wear a crown . The Buddha did not demean himself when he honored you .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>Ap</speaker>
        <p>Allow me one question . Did the Buddha ever beg you to support his brotherhood ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>Bb</speaker>
        <p>No , he did not ; but I will give him all the assistance he may need .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>Ap</speaker>
        <p>Did he ever offer you the support of his vows , or did he ever praise the efficacy of his holiness ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>Bb</speaker>
        <p>He never did .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>Ap</speaker>
        <p>Neither does he stand in need of self-recommendation , for his very presence is a blessing , because he spreads goodwill and kindliness , and the people who hear him are ashamed of doing anything unrighteous . Devadatta extends to you the promise , if you but support his disciples , of an unconditional protection through his holiness . The Buddha 's protection is not so cheaply earned . I heard him say that every one must protect himself by his own righteousness , and no prayer , no sacrifice , no religious devotion , nor even penance or fasts could protect a man from the wrongs which he does .</p>

Living pictures accompanied by appropriate music . 1 . SENDING OUT THE DISCIPLES . The Buddha called his disciples together , and having ordained them , bade them spread the Gospel , with these words translated from the Buddhist Canon : “ Go ye now , O disciples , and wander forth for the benefit of the many , for the welfare of mankind , out of compassion for the world . Preach the doctrine which is glorious in the beginning , glorious in the middle , and glorious in the end , in the spirit as well as in the letter . There are beings whose eyes are scarcely covered with dust , but if the doctrine is not preached to them they cannot attain salvation . Proclaim to them a life of holiness . They will understand the doctrine and accept it . ” The Pali expression kalyamo dhamma is here translated “ glorious doctrine . ” The dictionary defines the first word as “ excellent , beautiful , glorious . ” This closely corresponds to the Christian term , which , as derived from the Greek , reads “ evangel ” and in its Saxon equivalent “ gospel ” or “ good tidings . ” 2 . THE RICH YOUTH . Yasa , the son of a wealthy nobleman of Benares , came by night to the Blessed One and exclaimed : “ What misery ! ” But the Buddha answered , “ There is no misery for him who has entered the Path . ” Yasa , richly dressed , with an expression of distress , before the Buddha who comforts him . The scene is framed in darkness , the two figures being lit up by a torch . 3 . A CHILD 'S OFFERING . Old frescoes in the Ajanta Caves show a mother sending a gift through her child . It looks as if they were Buddhist illustrations of Christ 's injunction , “ Suffer little children to come unto me . ”</p>

        <speaker>J</speaker>
        <p>I hear that King Bimbisara has sent an embassy to the Buddha to induce him to come back to Rajagaha . Has the Buddha received these men ?</p>

        <p>Not yet . He will see them this morning .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>J</speaker>
        <p>We ought to keep him here . He is a wonderful man , and I consider our city fortunate to have him reside with us . What astonishes me is his way of conquering the hearts of all men , even of his opponents , and he is so sensible .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>A</speaker>
        <p>What do you mean ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>J</speaker>
        <p>I am not a religious man ; I am too worldly , but him I would follow .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>A</speaker>
        <p>Why ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>J</speaker>
        <p>He is perhaps the only religious reformer who does not go to extremes . He rejects on the one hand austerities , self-mortifications , penances , and severe fasts as useless , and on the other hand , he would not allow his followers to indulge in pleasures ; but he insists most sensibly on keeping between the two extremes and proclaims the middle path of leading a righteous life . There is nothing absurd about him . Think of Devadatta . He insists that the monks should dress in rags picked up in cemeteries . The Buddha appeals to common sense , and therefore I say , he is a wonderful man .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>A</speaker>
        <p>He is more than a man ; he is enlightenment incarnate . A stream of blessings goes out from him .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>J</speaker>
        <p>He has grown into an international power , and kings do well not to ignore his influence .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>A</speaker>
        <p>I think so myself , and I am so glad that his influence is always for good , never for evil , and his ways are so marvelously gentle .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>J</speaker>
        <p>Indeed that is a blessing . If he were not so absolutely indifferent to his own affairs he might become positively dangerous . His lay disciples count in thousands of thousands . The farmers in the country , the merchants in the towns , the lawyers , the artisans , and even the soldiers believe in him . Lately General Siha became a lay member of the Buddha 's brotherhood , and many other prominent officers followed his example .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>A</speaker>
        <p>He would never have gained this influence if he were not truly the Buddha .</p>

       <sp>
        <speaker>J</speaker>
        <p>I want to tell you that a war is threatening , but please do not speak of it , it is a deep secret . A spy in the secret service of my royal brother has found out that King Bimbisara intends to fall upon the Sakyas and deprive them of their independence . The Brahman Visakha , minister of state , has turned traitor and promises to deliver his country into the hands of King Bimbisara on the condition that he be made Raja in Suddhodana 's place .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>A</speaker>
        <p>The country of the Sakyas is but small , and their independence will not last long ; it is a mere question of time .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>J</speaker>
        <p>But consider that the Buddha hails from Kapilavatthu . He is the son of Suddhodana , the Sakya raja .</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>A</speaker>
        <p>Indeed he is and may I be permitted to inform him of the danger that threatens his father 's house ?</p>
       </sp>
       <sp>
        <speaker>J</speaker>
        <p>I give you full liberty , for he will use discretion and not betray his informant . I deem Bimbisara 's plan dangerous to himself . A war with the Sakyas may cost Bimbisara his throne , for the people of Rajagaha believe in the Buddha , and I learn that even now the war rumors have made them restless .

        <p>All bodily existence passeth by For it is compound and will be dissolved ; But there is Law ; it is the Uncreate , It is th ’ Etern , which is without beginning And without end . That must our refuge be . He who relies on the Impermanent , And , being strong , attempts to crush the weak , Will soon break down . This is the law of deeds , For as we sow , such will our harvest be . Rely on Truth , the Uncreate , th ’ Etern , Be guided by the rule of Righteousness . This is my message to the King , your Lord , And may he be advised to rule his country With love of peace , with goodness , and with wisdom . My blessing be on him and on his people . They kneel , clasp their hands , circumambulate the BUDDHA and file out . JETA returns in excitement .</p>

        <p>Oh no Sir . Not at all . He could live in luxury , if he wanted to , but he leads a simple life , as simple as the humblest servant in your home , and when he wanders through the country after the rainy season he lives like any mendicant friar . He overtook me on my way , and when he came hither to Kapilavatthu , his home , he did as usual . Last night he slept in the forest , and this morning he went from house to house with bowl in hand , begging his food , and he spoke a blessing wherever people greeted him kindly , or gave him to eat .</p>

        <p>The Blessed One deems it no shame to beg . He is as modest as a pauper and shows no pride , but wherever he comes , he is greeted like a king , nay like a king of kings , and the wealthiest and most powerful rulers come to do him reverence .</p>

        <p>Yes , he is here , and it is your son , but no longer Siddhattha , the Sakya prince , but Sakya muni , the sage of the Sakyas , the Buddha , the Blessed One . When I spoke to him and gave him your message , he inquired for you and the Queen Pajapati<stage>YASODHARA rises</stage>and for you , most honored Princess and for Rahula .

Two monks precede and stand at either side of the BUDDHA . Accompanying monks and other public come into the garden , crowding up to the columns . They all kneel with clasped hands , except SUDDHODANA .</p>

He wants you to entreat the Blessed One , The holy Buddha , who now stays with you , Who , as he learneth , is your noble son , To come to Rajagaha on a visit . There have been rumors of intended war , And armies are maneuvering nearby , But be assured , our noble King means peace . He would not draw the sword against your state , Nor wage a war against the Buddha 's father . SUDDHODANA 'S eye searches for the BUDDHA who has been standing behind a column and now steps forward .</p>

         <l>Thou needest neither lance , nor sword nor shield ,</l>
         <l>And yet thou rulest , with mere word and thought ,</l>
         <l>Thou sway'st the destinies of all the world ,</l>
         <l>I did not know thy power and thy great worth ;</l>
         <l>But now I bow me down in humble faith ,</l>
         <l>And I take refuge in the truth thou preachest .</l>
         <l>Henceforth I will devote myself to spread</l>
         <l>The kingdom of good will and righteousness .</l>
