   <stage>One week is supposed to elapse between Acts I and II .</stage>
   <stage>Acts II and III occupy one day .</stage>
   <stage>Act IV concerns the following morning .</stage>
   <stage>The Piper</stage>
   <p>ACT I</p>
   <stage>SCENE : The market-place of Hamelin . Right , the Minster , with an open shrine ( right centre ) containing a large sculptured figure of the Christ . Right , farther front , the house of KURT ; and other narrow house-fronts . Left , the Rathaus , and ( down ) the home of JACOBUS . Front , to left and right , are corner-houses with projecting stories and casement windows . At the centre rear , a narrow street leads away between houses whose gables all but meet overhead .</stage>
   <stage>It is late summer afternoon , with a holiday crowd . In the open casements , front ( right and left , opposite each other ) , sit OLD URSULA and OLD CLAUS , looking on at men and things . — In the centre of the place now stands a rude wooden Ark with a tented top : and out of the openings ( right and left ) appear the artificial heads of animals , worn by the players inside . One is a Bear ( inhabited by MICHAEL-THE-SWORD-EATER ) ; one is a large Reynard-the-Fox , later apparent as the PIPER . Close by is the medieval piece of stage-property known as ‘ Hell-Mouth , ’ i. e . a red painted cave with a jaw-like opening into which a mountebank dressed in scarlet ( CHEAT-THE-DEVIL ) is poking ‘ Lost Souls ’ with a pitchfork .</stage>
   <stage>BARBARA loiters by the tent . VERONIKA , the sad young wife of KURT , watches from the house steps , left , keeping her little lame boy , Jan , close beside her .</stage>
   <stage>Shouts of delight greet the end of the show , a Noah 's Ark miracle-play of the rudest ; and the Children continue to scream with joy whenever an Animal looks out of the Ark .</stage>
   <stage>Men and women pay scant attention either to JACOBUS , when he speaks ( himself none too sober ) — from his doorstep , prompted by the frowning KURT ,— or yet to ANSELM , the priest , who stands forth with lifted hands , at the close of the miracle-play .</stage>
   <stage>ANSELM And you , who heed the colors of this show , Look to your laughter !— It doth body forth A Judgment that may take you unaware ,— Sun-struck with mirth , like unto chattering leaves Some wind of wrath shall scourge to nothingness .</stage>
   <stage>HANS , AXEL , AND OTHERS Hurrah , Hurrah !</stage>
   <stage>JACOBUS And now , good townsmen all , Seeing we stand delivered and secure As once yon chosen creatures of the Ark , For a similitude ,— our famine gone , Our plague of rats and mice ,—</stage>
   <stage>CROWD Hurrah — hurrah !</stage>
   <stage>JACOBUS ‘ Tis meet we render thanks more soberly —</stage>
   <stage>HANS the Butcher Soberly , soberly , ay !—</stage>
   <stage>JACOBUS For our deliverance . And now , ye wit , it will be full three days Since we beheld — our late departed pest .—</stage>
   <stage>OLD URSULA [ putting out an ear-trumpet ] What does he say ?</stage>
   <stage>REYNARD [ from the Ark ] — Oh , how felicitous !</stage>
   <stage>HANS ’ WIFE He 's only saying there be no more rats .</stage>
   <stage>JACOBUS [ with oratorical endeavor ] Three days it is ; and not one mouse ,— one mouse , One mouse , I say !— No-o-o ! Quiet . . . as a mouse .</stage>
   <stage>[ Resuming ] And now . . .</stage>
   <stage>CROWD Long live Jacobus !—</stage>
   <stage>JACOBUS You have seen Noah and the Ark , most aptly happening by With these same play-folk . You have marked the Judgment . You all have seen the lost souls sent to — Hell — And , nothing more to do .—</stage>
   <stage>[ KURT prompts him ] Yes , yes .— And now . . .</stage>
   <stage>[ HANS the Butcher steps out of his group . ]</stage>
   <stage>HANS the Butcher Hath no man seen the Piper ?— Please your worships .</stage>
   <stage>OTHERS Ay , ay , so ! — Ay , where is he ? — Ho , the Piper !</stage>
   <stage>JACOBUS Piper , my good man ?</stage>
   <stage>HANS the Butcher — He that charmed the rats !</stage>
   <stage>OTHERS Yes , yes ,— that charmed the rats !</stage>
   <stage>JACOBUS [ piously ] Why , no man knows .— Which proves him such a random instrument As Heaven doth sometimes send us , to our use ; Or , as I do conceive , no man at all ,— A man of air ; or , I would say — delusion . He 'll come no more .</stage>
   <stage>REYNARD [ from the Ark ] Eh ?— Oh , indeed , Meaow !</stage>
   <stage>JACOBUS ‘ Tis clearest providence . The rats are gone . The man is gone . And there is nought to pay , Save peaceful worship . [ Pointing to the Minster . ]</stage>
   <stage>REYNARD [ sarcastically ] Oh , indeed ,— Meaow ! [ Sudden chorus of derisive animal noises from the Ark , delighting PEOPLE and CHILDREN . ]</stage>
   <stage>KURT Silence ,— you strollers there ! Or I will have you Gaoled , one and all .</stage>
   <stage>PEOPLE No , Kurt the Syndic , no !</stage>
   <stage>BARBARA [ to Jacobus ] No ; no ! Ah , father , bid them stay awhile And play it all again .— Or , if not all , Do let us see that same good youth again , Who swallowed swords — between the Ark Preserved And the Last Judgment !</stage>
   <stage>REYNARD Michael-the-Sword-Eater , Laurels for thee !</stage>
   <stage>[ The BEAR disappears : MICHAEL puts out his own head , and gazes fixedly at BARBARA .</stage>
   <stage>CHILDREN Oh , can n't we see the animals in the Ark ? Again ? Oh , can n't we see it all again ?</stage>
   <stage>ILSE Oh , leave out Noah ! And let 's have only Bears And Dromedaries , and the other ones !—</stage>
   <stage>[ General confusion . ]</stage>
   <stage>KURT Silence !</stage>
   <stage>JACOBUS Good people — you have had your shows ; And it is meet , that having held due feast , Both with our market and this Miracle , We bring our holiday to close with prayer And public thanks unto Saint Willibald ,— Upon whose day the rats departed thence .</stage>
   <stage>REYNARD [ loudly ] Saint Willibald !</stage>
   <stage>BEAR — Saint Willibald !</stage>
   <stage>OTHER ANIMALS [ looking out ] ( Saint Willibald ! ( Saint ! Oh !</stage>
   <stage>CROWD Saint Willibald !— And what had he to do With ridding us o ’ rats ?</stage>
   <stage>HANS the Butcher ‘ T was the Piping Man Who came and stood here in the market-place , And swore to do it for one thousand guilders !</stage>
   <stage>PETER the Cobbler Ay , and he did it , too !— Saint Willibald !</stage>
   <stage>[ Renewed uproar round the tent . ]</stage>
   <stage>KURT [ to Jacobus ] Drive out those mountebanks ! ‘ T is ever so . Admit them to the town and you must pay Their single show with riotings a week .— Look yonder at your daughter .</stage>
   <stage>[ BARBARA lingers by the Ark-Tent , gazing with girlish interest at MICHAEL , who gazes at her , his bear-head in his band for the moment . ]</stage>
   <stage>JACOBUS Barbara !</stage>
   <stage>[ She turns back , with an angry glance at KURT . ]</stage>
   <stage>AXEL the Smith [ doggedly to them ] By your leave . Masters ! I would like to know , How did Saint Willibald prevail with the rats ?— That would I like to know . I , who ha ’ made Of strong wrought traps , two hundred , thirty-nine , Two hundred , thirty-nine .</stage>
   <stage>REYNARD [ calling ] And so would I !</stage>
   <stage>HANS the Butcher So please your worships , may it please the Crier , Now we be here ,— to cry the Piping Man —</stage>
   <stage>PETER the Cobbler A stranger-man , gay-clad ,— in divers colors ! Because he , with said piping —</stage>
   <stage>HANS the Butcher — Drave away The horde of rats !</stage>
   <stage>PETER the Cobbler [ sagely ] To our great benefit ; And we be all just men .</stage>
   <stage>OTHERS Ay , ay !— Amen !</stage>
   <stage>WOMEN Amen , Our Lady and the blessed Saints !</stage>
   <stage>JACOBUS Why , faith , good souls , if ye will have him cried , So be it .— But the ways of Heaven are strange ! Mark how our angel of deliverance came ,— Or it may be . Saint Willibald himself ,— Most piedly clothed , even as the vilest player !— And straight ascended from us , to the clouds ! But cry him , if you will .— Peace to your lungs !— He will not come .</stage>
   <stage>[ KURT wrathfully consults with JACOBUS , then signals to Crier .</stage>
   <stage>CRIER Oyez ! Oyez ! Oyez ! Whereas , now three days gone , our Plague of Rats Was wholly driven hence , our City cleansed , Our peace restored after sore threat of famine , By a Strange Man who came not back again , Now , therefore , if this Man have ears to hear , Let him stand forth .— Oyez ! Oyez ! Oyez !</stage>
   <stage>[ Trumpet .— PEOPLE gaze up and down the little streets .— REYNARD steps out of the Ark and comes down slowly , with a modest air .— KURT points him out , threateningly , and the CROWD bursts into derisive laughter .— He doffs his animal-head at leisure , showing a sparkling dark-eyed face .</stage>
   <stage>ALL The Man ! the Man !</stage>
   <stage>KURT AND JACOBUS The Devil !— ‘ T is —</stage>
   <stage>ALL — THE PIPER !</stage>
   <stage>[ The PIPER regards them all with debonair satisfaction ; then reverses his head-piece and holds it out upside-down , with a confident smile .</stage>
   <stage>PIPER Three days of rest , your worships , you have had . I see no signs of famine hereabout . The rats are gone , even to the nethermost tail : And I 've fulfilled my bargain . Is it granted ?</stage>
   <stage>[ Murmurs , then cheers of “ Ay , Ay , PIPER ! ” from the crowd .</stage>
   <stage>Thank ‘ ee .— My thousand guilders , an you please .</stage>
   <stage>JACOBUS One thou — Come , come ! This was no sober bargain .— No man in reason could —</stage>
   <stage>PIPER One thousand guilders .</stage>
   <stage>KURT One thousand rogueries !</stage>
   <stage>JACOBUS [ to PIPER ] You jest too far .</stage>
   <stage>AXEL Lucky , if he get aught !— Two hundred traps , And nine , and thirty ! By Saint Willibald , When was I paid ?</stage>
   <stage>AXEL 'S WIFE Say , now !</stage>
   <stage>PIPER . . . One thousand guilders .</stage>
   <stage>PETER the Cobbler Give him an hundred .</stage>
   <stage>HANS the Butcher Double !</stage>
   <stage>HANS ’ WIFE You were fools To make agreement with him .— Ask old Claus . He has the guilders ; and his house was full 0 ’ rats !</stage>
   <stage>OLD CLAUS [ shaking his stick from the window ] You Jade ! And I that hoard , and save , And lay by all I have from year to year , To build my monument when I am gone , A fine new tomb there , in Saint Boniface ! And I to pay for all your city rats !</stage>
   <stage>OLD URSULA [ leaning out , opposite ] Right , neighbor , right well said !— Piper , hark here . Piper , how did ye charm the rats away ?</stage>
   <stage>PIPER [ coming down ] The rats were led — by Cu-ri-os-ity . ‘ Tis so with many rats ; and all old women ;— Saving your health !</stage>
   <stage>JACOBUS No thought for public weal , In this base grasping on —</stage>
   <stage>PIPER One thousand guilders .</stage>
   <stage>KURT [ contemptuously ] For piping !</stage>
   <stage>PIPER Shall I pipe them back again ?</stage>
   <stage>WOMEN ( Good Saint Boniface ! Merciful heaven ! ( Good Saint Willibald ! ( Peter and Paul defend us !</stage>
   <stage>HANS the Butcher No , no ; no fear o ’ that . The rats be drowned . We saw them with our eyes .</stage>
   <stage>PIPER Now who shall say There is no resurrection for a mouse ?</stage>
   <stage>KURT — Do you but crop this fellow 's ears !—</stage>
   <stage>VERONIKA [ from the steps ] Ah , Kurt !</stage>
   <stage>JACOBUS [ to him , blandly ] Deal patiently , good neighbor . All is well . [ To the PIPER ] Why do you name a price so laughable , My man ? Call you to mind ; you have no claim ,— No scrip to show . You cling upon —</stage>
   <stage>PIPER [ sternly ] Your word .</stage>
   <stage>JACOBUS I , would say — just —</stage>
   <stage>PIPER Your word .</stage>
   <stage>JACOBUS Upon —</stage>
   <stage>PIPER Your word . Sure , ‘ t was a rotten parchment !</stage>
   <stage>JACOBUS This is a base , Conniving miser !</stage>
   <stage>PIPER [ turning proudly ] Stand forth , Cheat-the-Devil ! [ Up steps the DEVIL in red . PEOPLE shrink , and then come closer . Be not afeard . He pleased you all , of late . He hath no sting .— So , boy ! Do off thy head .—</stage>
   <stage>[ CHEAT-THE-DEVIL doffs his red head-dress and stands forth , a pale and timorous youth , gentle and half-witted .</stage>
   <stage>Michael , stand forth ! [ MICHAEL comes down , bear-head in hand .</stage>
   <stage>BARBARA [ regarding him sadly ] That goodly sword-eater !</stage>
   <stage>PIPER [ defiantly ] So , Michael , so .— These be two friends of mine . Pay now an even third to each of us . Or , to content your doubts , to each of these Do you pay here and now , five hundred guilders . Who gets it matters little , for us friends . But you will pay the sum , friend . You will pay !—</stage>
   <stage>HANS , AXEL , AND CROWD Come , there 's an honest fellow . Ay , now , pay ! — There 's a good friend .— And would I had the same . — One thousand guilders ? — No , too much . — No , no .</stage>
   <stage>KURT Pay jugglers ?— With a rope apiece !</stage>
   <stage>JACOBUS Why — so —</stage>
   <stage>PIPER They are my friends ; and they shall share with me . ‘ T is time that Hamelin reckoned us for men ; — Hath ever dealt with us as we were vermin . Now have I rid you of the other sort — Right you that score !—</stage>
   <stage>KURT These outcasts !</stage>
   <stage>PIPER [ hotly ] Say you so ? Michael , my man ! Which of you here will try With glass or fire , with him ?</stage>
   <stage>MICHAEL [ sullenly ] No , no more glass , to-day !</stage>
   <stage>PIPER Then fire and sword ! [ They back away . ] So !— And there 's not one man In Hamelin , here , so honest of his word . Stroller ! A pretty choice you leave us .— Quit This strolling life , or stroll into a cage ! What do you offer him ? A man eats fire — Swords , glass , young April frogs —</stage>
   <stage>CHILDREN Do it again ! Do it again !</stage>
   <stage>PIPER You say to such a man ,— ‘ Come be a monk ! A weaver ! ’ Pretty choice . Here 's Cheat-the-Devil , now .</stage>
   <stage>PETER the Cobbler But what 's his name ?</stage>
   <stage>PIPER He does n't know . What would you ? Nor do I . But for the something he has seen of life , Making men merry , he ‘ d know something more ! The gentlest devil ever spiked Lost Souls Into Hell-mouth ,— for nothing-by-the-day !</stage>
   <stage>OLD URSULA [ with her ear-trumpet ] Piper , why do you call him Cheat-the-Devil ?</stage>
   <stage>PIPER Because his deviltry is all a cheat :— He is no devil ,— but a gentle heart ! — Friend Michael here hath played the Devil , betimes , Because he can so bravely breathe out fire . He plied the pitchfork so we yelped for mercy ,— He reckoned not the stoutness of his arm !— But Cheat-the-Devil here ,— he would not hurt Why — Kurt the Syndic — thrusting him in hell . [ Laughter .</stage>
   <stage>CHEAT-THE-DEVIL [ unhappily ] No , no — I will not hurt him !</stage>
   <stage>PIPER [ soothingly to him ] Merry , boy ! [ To the townsfolk ] And ,— if ye will have reasons , good ,— ye see ,— I want — one thousand guilders .</stage>
   <stage>JACOBUS In all surety , Payment you 'll have , my man , But —</stage>
   <stage>HANS the Butcher As to ‘ s friends ,— An that yon Devil be as feat wi ’ his hands As he be slow o ’ tongue , why , I will take him For prentice . Wife ,— now that would smack o ’ pride !</stage>
   <stage>PETER the Cobbler I 'll take this fellow that can swallow fire , He 's somewhat old for me . But he can learn My trade .— A pretty fellow !</stage>
   <stage>PIPER And your trade ?</stage>
   <stage>PETER the Cobbler Peter the cobbler .—</stage>
   <stage>MICHAEL I ? What , I ? Make shoes ? [ Proudly ] I swallow fire .</stage>
   <stage>PIPER Enough .</stage>
   <stage>BARBARA [ aside , bitterly ] I 'll not believe it .</stage>
   <stage>PIPER [ to HANS ] Your trade ?</stage>
   <stage>HANS the Butcher I 'm Hans the Butcher .</stage>
   <stage>MICHAEL Butcher ?</stage>
   <stage>CHEAT-THE-DEVIL [ unhappily ] Butcher ! Oh , no ! I could n't hurt them .</stage>
   <stage>[ Loud laughter .</stage>
   <stage>BUTCHER 'S WIFE ‘ T is a fool !</stage>
   <stage>[ The PIPER motions to MICHAEL and CHEAT-THE-DEVIL , who during the following join the other player-folk , strike their tent , pack their bundles , and wheel off the bar rows that have served them for an Ark , leaving the space clear before the Shrine . Exeunt Strollers , all but MICHAEL , who hangs about , still gazing at BARBARA .</stage>
   <stage>JACOBUS Good people , we have wasted time enow . You see this fellow , that he has no writ —</stage>
   <stage>PIPER Why not , then ? ‘ T was a bargain . If your word Hold only when ‘ t is writ —</stage>
   <stage>KURT We cannot spend Clerkship on them that neither write nor read . What good would parchment do thee ?</stage>
   <stage>JACOBUS My good man —</stage>
   <stage>PIPER Who says I cannot read ?— Who says I cannot ?</stage>
   <stage>OLD CLAUS Piper , do n't tell me you can read in books !</stage>
   <stage>PIPER [ at bay ] Books ! Where 's a book ? Shew me a book , I say !</stage>
   <stage>OLD URSULA The Holy Book ! Bring that — or he 'll bewitch you .</stage>
   <stage>PIPER Oh , never fear . I charm but fools and children ; Now that the rats are gone .— Bring me a Book : A big one !—</stage>
   <stage>[ Murmurs . The PIPER defiant . The crowd moves towards the Minster . Enter ANSELM the priest , with a little acolyte ,— the two bearing a large illuminated Gospel-book . ANSELM , eyeing the PIPER gravely , opens the book , which the boy supports on his head and shoulders .</stage>
   <stage>PIPER Ho , ‘ t is too heavy ! Come , you cherub-head , Here 's too much laid upon one guardian angel ! [ Beckons another small boy , and sets the book on their two backs . Well ?— well ? What now ? [ He looks in frank bewilderment at the eager crowd .</stage>
   <stage>CROWD Read , read !</stage>
   <stage>KURT He cannot read .</stage>
   <stage>PIPER [ to ANSELM ] Turn — turn — there 's nothing there . [ ANSELM turns pages . PIPER looks on blankly ] . . . Ah , turn again ! The red one !— [ He takes his fife from his belt ] No , the green ! The green one . So . [ Starts to pipe , looking on the book . ]</stage>
   <stage>CROWD ( Sure ‘ t is a mad-man ! ( But hear him piping ! ( What is he doing ?</stage>
   <stage>PIPER [ puzzled at their mirth ] What the green one says .— [ A burst of laughter from the crowd . JAN , the little lame boy on the steps , reaches his arms out suddenly and gives a cry of delight .</stage>
   <stage>JAN Oh , I love the Man !</stage>
   <stage>[ He goes , with his crutch , to the PIPER , who turns and gathers him close .</stage>
   <stage>JACOBUS [ to the People ] Leave off this argument .</stage>

   <stage>JACOBUS Saint Willibald !</stage>
   <stage>PIPER [ in a rage ] That Saint !—</stage>
   <stage>KURT Hence , wandering dog !</stage>
   <stage>PIPER Oho !— Well , every Saint may have his day . But there are dog-days coming .— Eh , your worship ? [ To ANSELM , suddenly ] You , there ! You — Brother — Father — Uncle — You ! Speak ! Will you let them in , to say their prayers And mock me through their fingers ?— Tell these men To settle it , among their mouldy pockets , Whether they keep their oath . Then will I go .</stage>
   <stage>KURT [ savagely ] Away with you !—</stage>
   <stage>ANSELM The Piper should be heard ; Ye know it well . Render to Caesar , therefore , That which is Caesar 's .</stage>
   <stage>PIPER — Give the Devil his due !</stage>
   <stage>JACOBUS [ warily ] We must take counsel over such a sum .</stage>
   <stage>[ Beckoning others , he and KURT go into the Rathaus , followed by all the men . Exit ANSELM with the Holy Book into the Minster .— The children play Mouse , to and fro , round about the PIPER .— The women , some of them , spin on the doorsteps , with little hand distaff 's , or stand about , gossiping .</stage>
   <stage>[ The PIPER wipes his forehead and goes up slowly ( centre ) to drink from the fountain at the foot of the Shrine .— MICHAEL , like one in a dream , comes down towards BARBARA , who gazes back at him , fascinated , through her laughter .</stage>
   <stage>BARBARA Is it for pay you loiter , Master Player ? Were you not paid enough ?</stage>
   <stage>MICHAEL No .— One more look .</stage>
   <stage>BARBARA Here , then .— Still not enough ?</stage>
   <p>MICHAEL</p>
   <stage>No ! One more smile .</stage>
   <stage>BARBARA [ agitated ] Why would you have me smile ?</stage>
   <stage>MICHAEL [ passionately ] Oh , when you smiled , It was — it was like sunlight coming through Some window there , [ Pointing to the Minster ] — some vision of Our Lady . [ She drops her flowers .— He picks them up and gives them back slowly .</stage>
   <stage>BARBARA Who are you ? You are some one in disguise .</stage>
   <stage>MICHAEL [ bitterly ] A man — that passes for a mountebank .</stage>
   <stage>BARBARA [ eagerly ] I knew !</stage>
   <stage>MICHAEL What then ?</stage>
   <stage>BARBARA Thou art of noble birth . ‘ T is some disguise , this playing with the fire !</stage>
   <stage>MICHAEL Yes .— For to-day , I lord it with the fire . But it hath burned me , here . [ Touching his breast . ] [ Overcome for the moment , she draws away .— The PIPER , coming down , speaks stealthily to MICHAEL , who is still gazing .</stage>
   <stage>PIPER For all our sakes ! There is bad weather breeding .— Take to thy heels .</stage>
   <stage>[ BARBARA turns back to see MICHAEL withdrawing reluctantly , and throws a rose to him with sudden gayety .</stage>
   <stage>BARBARA Farewell to you , Sword-Swallower !— farewell !</stage>
   <stage>MICHAEL [ looking back ] Farewell to you , my Lady , in-the-Moon . [ Exit . [ JAN clings once more to the PIPER , while the other children hang about . VERONIKA calls to her boy , from the steps .</stage>
   <stage>VERONIKA Darling .—</stage>
   <stage>PIPER [ drawing nearer ] Is this your Boy ?</stage>
   <stage>VERONIKA Ay , he is mine ; My only one . He loved thy piping so .</stage>
   <stage>PIPER And I loved his .</stage>
   <stage>HANS ’ WIFE [ stridently ] Poor little boy ! He 's lame !</stage>
   <stage>PIPER ‘ T is all of us are lame ! But he , he flies .</stage>
   <stage>VERONIKA Jan , stay here if you will , and hear the pipe , At Church-time .</stage>
   <stage>PIPER [ to him ] Wilt thou ?</stage>
   <stage>JAN [ softly ] Mother lets me stay Here with the Lonely Man .</stage>
   <stage>PIPER The Lonely Man ? [ JAN points to the Christ in the Shrine . VERONIKA crosses herself . The PIPER looks long at the little boy .</stage>
   <stage>VERONIKA He always calls Him so .</stage>
   <stage>PIPER And so would I .</stage>
   <stage>VERONIKA It grieves him that the Head is always bowed , And stricken . But he loves more to be here Than yonder in the church .</stage>
   <stage>PIPER And so do I .</stage>
   <stage>VERONIKA What would you , darling , with the Lonely Man ? What do you wait to see ?</stage>
   <stage>JAN [ shyly ] To see Him smile .</stage>
   <stage>[ The women murmur . The PIPER comes down further to speak to VERONIKA .</stage>
   <stage>PIPER You are some foreign woman . Are you not ? Never from Hamelin !</stage>
   <stage>VERONIKA No .</stage>
   <stage>AXEL 'S WIFE [ to her child ] Then run along . And ask the Piper if he 'll play again The tune that charmed the rats .</stage>
   <stage>ANOTHER They might come back !</stage>
   <stage>OLD URSULA [ calling from her window ] Piper ! I want the tune that charmed the rats ! If they come back , I 'll have my grandson play it .</stage>
   <stage>PIPER I pipe but for the children .</stage>
   <stage>ILSE [ dropping her doll and picking it up ] Oh , do pipe Something for Fridolin !</stage>
   <stage>HANSEL Oh , pipe at me ! Now I 'm a mouse ! I 'll eat you up ! Rr — rr !—</stage>
   <stage>CHILDREN Oh , pipe ! Oh , play ! Oh , play and make us dance ! Oh , play , and make us run away from school !</stage>
   <stage>PIPER Why , what are these ?</stage>
   <stage>CHILDREN [ scampering round him ] We 're mice , we 're mice , we 're mice ! . . . We 're mice , we 're mice ! We 'll eat up everything !</stage>
   <stage>MARTIN 'S WIFE [ calling ] ‘ T is church-time . La , what will the neighbors say ?</stage>
   <stage>ILSE [ Waving her doll ] Oh , please do play something for Fridolin !</stage>
   <stage>AXEL 'S WIFE Do hear the child . She 's quite the little mother !</stage>
   <stage>PIPER A little mother ? Ugh ! How horrible . That fairy thing , that princess ,— no , that Child ! A little mother ? [ To her ] Drop the ugly thing !</stage>
   <stage>MARTIN 'S WIFE Now , on my word ! and what 's amiss with mothers ? Are mothers horrible ? [ The PIPER is struck with painful memories . ]</stage>
   <stage>PIPER No , no . But — care And want and pain and age . . . [ Turns back to them with a bitter change of voice ] And penny-wealth ,— And penny-counting .— Penny prides and fears — Of what the neighbors say the neighbors say !—</stage>
   <stage>MARTIN 'S WIFE And were you born without a mother , then ?</stage>
   <stage>ALL Yes , you there ! Ah , I told you ! He 's no man . He 's of the devil .</stage>
   <stage>MARTIN 'S WIFE Who was your mother , then ?</stage>
   <stage>PIPER [ fiercely ] Mine !— Nay , I do not know . For when I saw her , She was a thing so trodden , lost and sad , I cannot think that she was ever young , Save in the cherishing voice .— She was a stroller ; My father was a stroller .— So , you have it ! And since she clave to him , and hunger too , The Church 's ban was on her .— Either live , Mewed up forever ,— she ! to be a nun ; Or keep her life-long wandering with the wind ; The very name of wife stript from her troth . That was my mother .— And she starved and sang ; And like the wind , she roved and lurked and shuddered Outside your lighted windows , and fled by , Storm-hunted , trying to outstrip the snow , South , south , and homeless as a broken bird ,— Limping and hiding !— And she fled , and laughed , And kept me warm ; and died ! To you , a Nothing ; Nothing , forever , oh , you well-housed mothers ! As always , always for the lighted windows Of all the world , the Dark outside is nothing ; And all that limps and hides there in the dark ; Famishing ,— broken ,— lost ! And I have sworn For her sake and for all , that I will have Some justice , all so late , for wretched men , Out of these same smug towns that drive us forth After the show !— Or scheme to cage us up Out of the sunlight ; like a squirrel 's heart Torn out and drying in the market-place . My mother ! Do you know what mothers are ?— Your children ! Do you know them ? Ah , not you ! There 's not one here but it would follow me , For all your bleating !</stage>
   <stage>AXEL 'S WIFE Kuno , come away !</stage>
   <stage>[ The children cling to him . He smiles down triumphantly .</stage>
   <stage>PIPER Oho , Oho ! Look you ?— You preach — I pipe ! [ Reenter the men , with KURT and JACOBUS , from the Rathaus , murmuring dubiously . [ The PIPER sets down JAN and stands forth , smiling .</stage>
   <stage>JACOBUS [ smoothly ] H 'm ! My good man , we have faithfully debated Whether your vision of so great a sum Might be fulfilled ,— as by some miracle . But no . The moneys we administer Will not allow it ; nor the common weal . Therefore , for your late service , here you have Full fifteen guilders , [ Holding forth a purse ] and a pretty sum Indeed , for piping !</stage>
   <stage>KURT [ ominously ] Take them !</stage>
   <stage>JACOBUS Either that , Or , to speak truly , nothing ! [ The PIPER is motionless ] Come , come . Nay , count them , if you will .</stage>
   <stage>KURT Time goes !</stage>
   <stage>PIPER Ay . And your oath ?</stage>
   <stage>KURT No more ; Enough .</stage>
   <stage>[ There is a sound of organ music from the Minster . ]</stage>
   <stage>VERONIKA [ beseechingly ] Ah , Kurt !</stage>
   <stage>KURT [ savagely to the crowd ] What do ye , mewling of this fellow 's rights ? He hath none !— Wit ye well , he is a stroller , A wastrel , and the shadow of a man ! Ye waste the day and dally with the law . Such have no rights ; not in their life nor body ! We are in no wise bound . Nothing is his . He may not carry arms ; nor have redress For any harm that men should put on him , Saving to strike a shadow on the wall ! He is a Nothing , by the statute-book ; And , by the book , so let him live or die , Like to a masterless dog !</stage>
   <stage>[ The PIPER stands motionless with head up-raised , not looking at KURT . The people , half-cowed , half-doubting , murmur and draw back . Lights appear in the Minster ; the music continues . KURT and JACOBUS lead in the people . JACOBUS picks up the money-purse and takes it with him .</stage>
   <stage>VOICES [ laughing , drunkenly ] One thousand guilders to a ‘ masterless dog ’ ! [ Others laugh too , pass by , with pity and derision for the PIPER , and echoes of ‘ MASTERLESS DOG ! ’ Exeunt WOMEN and MEN to the Minster . Only the children are left , dancing round the motionless figure of the PIPER .</stage>
   <stage>CHILDREN Oh , pipe again ! Oh , pipe and make us dance ! Oh , pipe and make us run away from school ! Oh , pipe and make believe we are the mice !</stage>
   <stage>[ He looks down at them . He looks up at the houses . Then he signs to them , with his finger on his lips ; and begins , very softly , to pipe the Kinder-spell . The old CLAUS and URSULA in the windows seem to doze .</stage>
   <stage>The children stop first , and look at him , fascinated ; then they laugh , drowsily , and creep closer ,— JAN always near . They crowd around him . He pipes louder , moving backwards , slowly , with magical gestures , towards the little by-streets and the closed doors . The doors open , everywhere .</stage>
   <stage>Out come the children : little ones in night gowns ; bigger ones , with playthings , toy animals , dolls . He pipes , gayer and louder . They pour in , right and left . Motion and music fill the air . The PIPER lifts JAN to his shoulder ( dropping the little crutch ) and marches off , up the street at the rear , piping , in the midst of them all .</stage>
   <stage>Last , out of the Minster come tumbling two little acolytes in red , and after them , PETER the Sacristan . He trips over them in his amazement and terror ; and they are gone after the vanishing children before the church-people come out .</stage>
   <stage>The old folks lean from their windows .</stage>
   <stage>OLD URSULA The bell , the bell ! the church bell ! They 're bewitched !</stage>
   <stage>[ Peter rushes to the bell-rope and pulls it . The bell sounds heavily . Reenter , from the church , the citizens by twos and threes and scores .</stage>

     <stage type="setting">
      <stage>A great , dim-lighted , cavernous place , which shows signs of masonry . It is part cavern and part cellarage of a ruined , burned-down and forgotten old monastery in the hills .— The only entrance ( at the centre rear ) , a ramshackle wooden door , closes against a flight of rocky steps .— Light comes from an opening in the roof , and from the right , where a faggot-fire glows under an iron pot .— The scene reaches ( right and left ) into dim corners , where sleeping children lie curled up together like kittens .</stage>
      <stage>By the fire sits the PIPER , on a tree-stump seat , stitching at a bit of red leather . At his feet is a row of bright-colored small shoes , set two and two . He looks up now and then , to recount the children , and goes back to work , with quizzical despair .</stage>
      <stage>Left , sits a group of three forlorn Strollers . One nurses a lame knee ; one , evidently dumb , talks in signs to the others ; one is munching bread and cheese out of a wallet . All have the look of hunted and hungry men . They speak only in whispers to each other throughout the scene ; but their hoarse laughter breaks out now and then over the bird-like ignorance of the children .</stage>

He fingers his pipe . As the hymn draws near , he scrambles among the bushes , left , and disappears . Enter slowly , chanting , the company of burghers from Hamelin ,— men together first , headed by priests ; then the women .— ANSELM and all the townsfolk appear<stage>saving VERONIKA , the wife of KURT</stage>; JACOBUS is meek ; KURT very stern .— As they appear , the piping of the Dance-spell begins softly , high in air . The hymn wavers ; when the first burghers reach the centre of the stage , it breaks down . They look up , bewildered : then , with every sign of consternation , struggle , and vacant fear , they begin to dance , willy-nilly . Their faces work ; they struggle to walk on ; but it is useless . The music whirls them irresistibly into a rhythmic pace of 3 / 4 time , and jogs their words , when they try to speak , into the same dance-measure . One by one ,— two and two they go ,— round and round like corks at first , with every sign of struggle and protest , then off , on the long road to Rudersheim . Fat priests waltz together .— KURT the fierce and JACOBUS the sleek hug each other in frantic endeavor to be released . Their words jolt insanely .</p>

Put off now , the dust , the mould , The cobble-stones , the little prying windows ; The streets that dream o ’ What the Neighbors Say . Think you were never born there . Think some Breath Wakened you early — early on one morning , Deep in a Garden<stage>but you knew not whose</stage>, Where voices of wild waters bubbling ran , Shaking down music from glad mountain-tops ,— Where the still peaks were burning in the dawn , Like fiery snow ,— down into greenest valleys , That do off their blue mist only to show Some deeper blue , some haunt of violets . No voice you heard , nothing you felt or saw , Save in your heart , the tumult of young birds , A nestful of wet wings and morning-cries , Throbbing for flight ! . . . Then ,— for your Soul , new wakened , felt athirst , You turned to where that call of water led , Laughing for truth ,— all truth and star-like laughter ! Beautiful water , that will never stay , But runs and laughs and sparkles in the heart , And sends live laughter trickling everywhere , And knows the thousand longings of the Earth ! And as you drank it then , so now , drink here ;<stage>He reaches her the horn . She has listened , motionless , like a thing bewitched , her eyes fixed and wide , as if she were sleep-walking . She drinks . MICHAEL stands near , also motionless . When she speaks , it is in a younger voice , shy , sweet and full of wonder .</stage>And tell me ,— tell me , you ,— what happened then ?

Think of those old as death , in body and heart , Hugging their wretched hoardings , in cold fear Of moth and rust !— While these miraculous ones , Like golden creatures made of sunset-cloud , Go out forever ,— every day , fade by With music and wild stars !— Ah , but You know . The hermit told me once . You loved them , too . But I know more than he , how You must love them : Their laughter , and their bubbling , skylark words To cool Your heart . Oh , listen , Lonely Man !— Oh , let me keep them ! I will bring them to You , Still nights , and breathless mornings ; they shall touch Your hands and feet with all their swarming hands , Like showering petals warm on furrowed ground ,— All sweetness ! They will make Thee whole again , With love . Thou wilt lookup and smile on us ! Why not ? I know — the half — You will be saying . You will be thinking of Your Mother .— Ah , But she was different . She was not as they . She was more like . . . this one , the wife of Kurt ! Of Kurt ! No , no ; ask me not this , not this ! Here is some dawn of day for Hamelin ,— now ! -Tis hearts of men You want . Not mumbled prayers ; Not greed and carven tombs , not misers ’ candles ; No offerings , more , from men that feed on men ; Eternal psalms and endless cruelties ! . . . Even from now , there may be hearts in Hamelin , Once stabbed awake !<stage>He pleads , defends , excuses passionately ; before his will gives way , as the arrow flies from the bow-string .</stage>— I will not give them back ! And Jan ,— for Jan , that little one , that dearest To Thee and me , hark ,— he is wonderful . Ask it not of me . Thou dost know I cannot ! Look , Lonely Man ! You shall have all of us To wander the world over , where You stand At all the crossways , and on lonely hills ,— Outside the churches , where the lost ones And the wayfaring men , and thieves and wolves And lonely creatures , and the ones that sing ! We will show all men what we hear and see ; And we will make Thee lift Thy head , and smile . No , no , I cannot give them all ! No , no .— Why wilt Thou ask it ?— Let me keep but one . No , no , I will not . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Have Thy way .— I will !</p>
