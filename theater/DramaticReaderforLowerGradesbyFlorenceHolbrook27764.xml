   <div type="dedication">
    <p>TO THE CHILDREN These little plays — well-known stories done into dialogue — were written for children who like to imagine themselves living with their favorite characters in forest , in palace , or in fairyland . It is hoped that you will enjoy these old friends in their new dress almost as well as you loved them in the old . When you read the words of bird or tree or prince or child , try to speak with the voice and manner which you think that character would use . Thus you will make the reading a joy to yourselves and a great satisfaction to your hearers . To try to put oneself in the place of another is very good training for the imagination . It also teaches us to be more kind to others and to all living creatures . We learn that most persons are striving to do better and to be better , and we grow in understanding and sympathy . May these little plays help you to the enjoyment of the great dramas which you will read when you are older .</p>

       <stage>Little Red Riding-Hood ( singing ) .</stage>
       <stage>Good morning , merry sunshine , How did you come so soon ? You chase the little stars away And shine away the moon . I saw you go to sleep last night Before I ceased my playing . How did you get ‘ way over there , And where have you been staying ?</stage>
       <stage>How pretty it is here in the wood ! Oh , what a lovely bed of moss ! You must come with me , pretty green moss , to grandma 's house . Good morning , pretty bird : will you sing to me this morning ?</stage>
      </stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Bird</speaker>
       <p>Yes , little Red Riding-Hood . I will sing to you because you love all the birds and can understand my song . Soon I 'll show you my little birds who are just big enough to fly . Little Red Riding-Hood . Thank you , dear bird , I shall be glad to see the cunning little things . But now I must hurry to grandmother 's with the butter and the honey . Good-by !</p>

       <speaker>Wolf</speaker>
       <lg>
        <l>From my pretty cave , far , far in the dark wood , little girl .</l>

       <p>I 'm a stranger in this place , little girl ; but I shall know you the next time I see you — ugh , ugh ! What have you in your pretty basket , little Red Riding-Hood ? It smells like honey . Little Red Riding-Hood . It is honey , Mr. Wolf . I am taking it to my dear grandmother .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Wolf</speaker>
       <p>Are you all alone in the wood , my child ? Is n't your mother with you ? Are n't you afraid ?<stage>Illustration</stage>Little Red Riding-Hood . Afraid ? no , indeed ! Why should I be afraid ? All the animals are my friends .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Wolf</speaker>
       <p>Oh , yes , of course they are all your friends ! But is it far to your grandmother 's house ? Little Red Riding-Hood . No , Mr. Wolf , only about half a mile . You go down this path to the mill and then turn to the right , and the first house you come to is my grandmother 's . It 's a little red house .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Wolf</speaker>
       <p>Oh , that is very easy to find ! But I know a shorter way through the wood . Let us run a race and see who will get there first . Little Red Riding-Hood . All right , Mr. Wolf . Good-by !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Wolf</speaker>
       <p>Ugh , ugh ; good-by ! Little Red Riding-Hood . How fast he runs ! I know he will win the race . How surprised dear grandma will be when Mr. Wolf knocks at the door ! Now I see the mill . I will sing the pretty mill song we learned in school the other day .<stage>Begins to sing , then stops suddenly .</stage>Oh , there is the miller . Good morning , Mr. Miller ! Have you seen Mr. Wolf go by ?</p>
      </sp>

       <p>No , little Red Riding-Hood . Have you seen a wolf in the wood ? Little Red Riding-Hood . Yes , Mr. Miller , and he said he would race with me to my grandmother 's house .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Miller</speaker>
       <p>My dear child , I will call the men who are chopping trees in the forest and they will catch Mr. Wolf . He is no friend of ours , and you must not talk with him , for he is cruel and will do you harm . Little Red Riding-Hood . Will he ? Then I will never say another word to him . But I must hurry on to dear grandmother 's .</p>

       <role>Goldilocks . O dear ! I do wish mother would come home . I am going to meet her . She told me not to go out of the garden lest I should get lost ; but if I keep in the road , I can n't get lost ! Come , Dollie , you and I will go just a little way to meet mamma</role>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>How warm it is in the sunshine ! I think we shall go into the shady wood a little while . Let us pick some of these pretty flowers to make a wreath — wo n't mother be surprised when I show her all these flowers . Here is a lovely red one ; and here 's another like a daisy</role>

       <role>How dark it is here ! I cannot see the road . I wonder if I 'm lost ! O mamma</role>

      <castItem>
       <role>Dollie . Yes</role>
       <roleDesc>or perhaps she is the Gingerbread Witch who will turn us into gingerbread for her supper !</roleDesc>

      <castItem>
       <role>Goldilocks . Do n't say such uncomfortable things</role>

       <role>Dollie . Well</role>
       <roleDesc>I know I 'm made of sawdust , but she might make mush of me for breakfast !</roleDesc>

      <castItem>
       <role>Goldilocks . I know you 're fooling now , dear Dollie . Let 's look in the window . I do n't see anyone . I 'll knock at the door . No one answers . Come , Dollie , we 'll open the door and walk in . How nice and warm it is . There is a good fire in the kitchen stove</role>

      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Dollie . Try the next bowl . Perhaps the porridge in the middle-sized bowl is not so hot</role>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Goldilocks . No</role>
       <roleDesc>indeed , it is n't ; but it is too cold</roleDesc>

      <castItem>
       <role>Dollie . Are n't you hard to please ? I 'm so hungry I could eat anything</role>

     <figure>
      <p>Rock-a-bye , Dollie , in the treetop , When the wind blows , the cradle will rock ; When the bough breaks , the cradle will fall And down will come Dollie , cradle and all ! [ Chair breaks . ] Dollie . Well , something broke then ! Goldilocks . Yes , the cradle and all came down that time . Dear , O dear ! I wish I had n't rocked you so hard . I wish I had n't run away ! [ Crying . ] Dollie . Do n't cry , dear Goldilocks . Let us see what we can find in the next room . Perhaps some one is in there who will take us to your dear mother . Goldilocks . O Dollie ! I 'm a naughty girl not to mind my mother . If I 'd only stayed at home in the garden ! Dollie . Oh , see the big bed ! Goldilocks . I 'm so tired I believe I 'll climb in and go to sleep . But I do n't like it . This big bed is too hard . Dollie . And this middle-sized one is too soft . Goldilocks . But this little one is just right . Go — to — sleep — Dollie —</p>

Oh , you are so good , and I was so tired and cold . Here I 'll rest . I wish I could ever thank you enough for your goodness . The Spruce . Do not speak of that , dear little bird ; I am ashamed of the proud , selfish trees that would not shelter you . Should we not all be kind and helpful to one another ? The Pine . Well said , sister Spruce . And I will do my best to help you . I am not so strong as the Oak tree , little bird , but I will stand between you and the cold north wind . Rest warm and safe in the branches of the kind Spruce tree . Little Bird . I thank you , tall Pine tree , for your kindness . You are a good brother of the Spruce and I shall rest well while you are both taking care of me . The Juniper . I cannot keep the strong north wind from you , little bird with the broken wing , but if you are hungry , you may eat of my berries . Perhaps then you will rest better . Little Bird . Thank you , dear Juniper tree . Why are you all so kind to me ? Your berries are good , and now I am cold and hungry no longer . I 'll go to sleep . Good night , dear trees ! Trees . Good night , little bird , and may you have sweet dreams ! [ Illustration</p>

       <p>Here I am in the great forest . How I dislike to touch all these beautiful leaves ; yet I must obey the orders of King Winter . Here comes the Forest Fairy . Do you know why I have come , dear Fairy of the Forest ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Forest Fairy</speaker>
       <p>Yes , Mr . Frost . I know that you must touch all the leaves , turning them into brilliant hues of gold and crimson and brown . I dislike to have them go , and yet you and I must obey the commands of King Winter . But ,—</p>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Forest Fairy</speaker>
       <p>I must tell you . Such a dear little bird came to the forest this evening . He had a broken wing , and he was cold and very tired . He asked shelter from the great Oak , the proud Maple , and the graceful Willow ,— and all refused . I was so ashamed of my trees !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Jack Frost</speaker>
       <p>What ! did all the trees refuse to help a poor , tired little bird ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Forest Fairy</speaker>
       <p>Listen ! just as I was intending to speak to the trees , I heard the Spruce tell him to come to her branches and she would give him shelter . Then the Pine tree offered to keep the north wind from him , and the Juniper gave him her berries to eat . Could you , dear Jack Frost —</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Jack Frost</speaker>
       <p>Yes , yes , I know what you would ask . Such kindness as this should meet with some reward . The leaves of the proud Oak , the Maple , and the Willow shall fall to the ground when the cold of winter comes ; but the Spruce , the Pine , the Juniper , and all their family shall keep their leaves and they shall be green all through the year . They shall be called the Evergreen Trees .</p>

I can charm with the magic of my notes all things to do my will . But I use my charm on creatures that do people harm , the toad , the mole , and the viper , and rats — rats ! Mayor . Rats ! Well , then , you 're the man we want . We 'll pay you a thousand guilders if you 'll free our town of rats . Piper . A thousand guilders ! Done ! It 's a bargain !</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>Prince</speaker>
       <p>Good morning , ladies , what a lovely tree you have here ! She who gives me a branch shall have whatever she wishes . Little One-Eye . The tree is ours , Great Prince ; but when we try to get its fruit , it slips away from us .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Prince</speaker>
       <p>It is strange , if the tree belongs to you , that you cannot get the fruit ! But where do these apples come from ? Little Three-Eyes . We have another sister , but she has only two eyes and we are ashamed of her ; so we hid her under this barrel , and she has rolled the apples out to you .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Prince</speaker>
       <p>Little Two-Eyes , come out . Can you get me a branch from this wonderful tree ? Little Two-Eyes . Yes , Prince ; here is a branch with many golden apples on it .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Prince</speaker>
       <p>And what is your wish , little Two-Eyes ? Little Two-Eyes . O Prince ! My mother and my sisters are ashamed of me and do not treat me well . They do not give me enough to eat and they do not like to have me near them . Please take me away where I can be happy and free !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Prince</speaker>
       <p>Come with me , little Two-Eyes ; you shall go to my father 's palace and be a little princess . There you will be happy and free and never be hungry or lonely again .</p>

      <head>THE DAYS OF THE WEEK</head>
      <head>THE WEEK — MONDAY , TUESDAY , WEDNESDAY , THURSDAY , FRIDAY , SATURDAY , SUNDAY</head>
     </stage>
     <stage>Illustration</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Monday</speaker>
      <p>Well , I am glad to be here at last . Certainly my work is very important . As the first working day of the week , I begin all business ; and I have always heard that if a thing is well begun , it is half done . People call me Moon-day — is n't that a pretty name , the day of the moon ? How beautiful the moon is , riding in her silver chariot across the dark blue sky ! I am proud of my name . The moon is constantly changing and I like change . I like brightness and cleanliness too , and good housewives wash their clothes on Monday . How white and clean they look hanging on the line ! The sun and wind play hide and seek and help to cleanse the clothes . School begins on Monday and the little children run and laugh on their way to school . Every one seems happy that another week has begun .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Illustration</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Tuesday</speaker>
      <p>I am named for Tui , the god of war . In the countries of the north I am greatly honored by all the people . Soldiers when going to war call on Tui for help , and they like to begin a battle on Tuesday . Monday likes to begin work , but I like to make some progress . The children always know their lessons better on Tuesday , and are happier than on Monday . The white clothes are sprinkled and rolled , and now the maids iron the pretty baby dresses and the house linen . They sing and laugh over their work . The world is all running smoothly on Tuesday , and I think I like my work the best .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Illustration</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Wednesday</speaker>
      <p>I should be the best of days , for I am named for Woden , or Odin , the king of the gods . The hardest work of the week is finished when I come , and there is time for a rest . Perhaps mother will bake a special cake for dinner . To-day the children take their music lessons , and the boys go for a lesson in swimming or gymnastic exercise . This is the day young people choose for their wedding day , and you do n't know how glad I am to be a part of their happiness . I believe I have more sunshine than the other days , for Woden likes to have clear skies and health-giving breezes . I would not change with any of my sister days .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Illustration</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Thursday</speaker>
      <p>I bring the thunder and the lightning , and I cleave the dark clouds with my rapid flashes . I glory in a storm , for Thor , the god of thunder , has chosen me for his day , and I bear his name . A life of ease and quiet has no charms for me . I like the din and crash of war , the noise and hurry of business . The fury of the heavens , the crash of falling trees , the roaring of waters ,— what can give greater pleasure ? Business thrives on Thursday . Men rush to and fro , buying and selling , building great houses , digging in the mines , and sailing the seas . Life and action are my delight . Hurrah for Thor 's day !</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Illustration</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Friday</speaker>
      <p>After the bustle and work of the week I come to clean and settle all disturbances . Now dirt and dust must disappear under the broom and brush . How the windows shine and how spotless is the hearth ! Children rake up the leaves and burn them ; all rubbish must be cleared away . Order and neatness I love ; and so does Freya , for whom I am named . She is the goddess of beauty , and there is no beauty where neatness and order are absent . Some say that I am an unlucky day , but that is a mistake . See what wonderful things have happened on my day , what great men have been born on Friday ! I am the last school day of the week , and to-day the children may forget lessons and play outdoors a little longer . To-day the family gather for a story at the twilight hour , and all is rest and happiness .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Illustration</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Saturday</speaker>
      <p>I am the jolly day of the week . “ School is out ! ” the children cry , and all day long they sing and call to each other in their games . To-day I smell the cakes and pies cooking in the range , for Saturday is baking day . How the little children love to watch mother stirring the cake and frosting , and how they beg to clean the sweet stuff out of the bowl . Father comes home earlier to-day , and all go for a walk in the woods or park . All men need a holiday , for “ all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy . ” The boys play ball and run and shout in their joy . The girls have little parties , and cook gives them some fresh cakes . I am named for Saetere , god of the harvest , and he is always merry . So I wish all people to be happy on Saturday , the play day of the week .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Illustration</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Sunday</speaker>
      <p>You have all spoken well , my sisters , and each one has some claim to be the best day of the week . How fine it is that every day holds some special joy in work or play ! But you all know the highest joy is mine . I am named for the golden sun that gives light to the world . On Sunday men think of the inner light that makes them love the good and the true and persuades them to do right . To-day the family is united , and in the morning with fresh garments and happy faces they seek the knowledge of a higher life . Around the dinner table they talk happily together of their work and play , and they plan how they may do better work during the next week . Love and peace are in all hearts . A desire to help the weak and poor and sad is in every soul . I am happy and blest to be Sunday .</p>

       <role>Ethelred . And there are jewels in the clasp !</role>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Queen . It is well bound</role>
       <roleDesc>as so precious a volume should be ; but the binding is the least valuable part of the book . Shall we look within ?</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Ethelbald . Pray show us</role>
       <roleDesc>lady mother !</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Queen . Observe the forms of mighty warriors</role>

      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Ethelbert . How brave they look ! Who are they ? Tell us of them</role>
       <roleDesc>dear mother</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Queen . These pictures are beautiful and appeal to the eye</role>

      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Alfred . What do you mean</role>
       <roleDesc>dear lady mother ?</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Queen . This is a book I greatly enjoy , for it is full of the tales of the mighty King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table . You will like to hear me read these brave stories when you are tired with your day 's work , or on rainy days when you can neither hunt nor ride . Then you know not how to amuse yourselves and time is heavy on your hands , since you can neither read nor play upon the musical instruments that give us so much pleasure</role>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Ethelred . The book is so lovely . Let me take it</role>
       <roleDesc>lady mother !</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Queen . I would that the children of my royal husband could read the book</role>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Ethelbald . Our father does not think much of books and music . He likes to hunt and fight</role>
       <roleDesc>and so do I</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Ethelred . And I love to hunt</role>
       <roleDesc>but I love to hear the stories of great kings and warriors , too</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Alfred . To which of us wilt thou give the book</role>
       <roleDesc>lady mother ?</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Queen . I will bestow it on him who shall first learn how to read it</role>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Alfred . Will you really</role>
       <roleDesc>dear mother ?</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Queen . Yes</role>
       <roleDesc>upon the faith of a queen , I will . I will not give it to one who cannot read it . Books are meant for the learned and not for the ignorant . The sons of a king should cease to play with toys</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Alfred . May I take the book a little while ?</role>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Queen . Yes , you may take the precious volume , Alfred , for I know you will not injure it , and I hope you will soon learn how to make its wisdom your own</role>

       <speaker>Alfred</speaker>
       <p>All the others have gone back to their homes . In no other way can ye serve me . Wherefore do ye go about to weep and break my heart ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Oscar</speaker>
       <p>We weep , royal Alfred , because thou hast forbidden us to share thy fortunes ; as if we were the swarm of summer flies , who follow only while the sun shineth .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Alfred</speaker>
       <p>My valiant Oscar , and you my faithful Odulph , listen to me . I do not despair . The time is not ripe now for further war . Our foes the Danes have conquered us for a time . I trust that the time will come when we shall drive them from our land . But we must do that which seems best for the present and seek to be more successful in the future . We must not sit down and weep ; no , this rather shall you do . Go back to your own people and keep me in their memory . When the Dane rules most cruelly , then rise up and cry aloud in the ears of the people , “ Alfred the king yet liveth ! ” Then gather the soldiers and I shall come to lead them to victory .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Oscar</speaker>
       <p>Thou shalt be obeyed , my royal lord . I will return to my men and do as thou hast said . But let my son Odulph stay with thee , if only as thy servant .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Odulph</speaker>
       <p>Well will I serve thee , my royal lord . It is not well for the king to fare alone .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Alfred</speaker>
       <p>I am well content to serve myself , or even to be servant to others , until a happier time shall come . If Odulph desires to serve me , it shall be by bringing good tidings of your success with my people . When the time comes that we may again fight for our country , let him bring me the welcome message . Then we will free our country from the Danish yoke .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Oscar</speaker>
       <p>Farewell , my royal master , since thou wilt have it so .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Odulph</speaker>
       <p>And may the time soon come when I shall bring the message to thee !</p>

       <p>Save you , good father ! May a Saxon stranger , whom the Danish robbers have made homeless , share a lodging with thy master 's cattle for the night ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Cudred</speaker>

       <speaker>Alfred</speaker>
       <p>To say truth , father , I have not broken my fast to-day ; neither have I had aught to drink save from these marshy streams . I shall be right thankful for some food , even a crust of coarsest rye bread .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Cudred</speaker>
       <p>Rye bread , forsooth ! Thou talkest of dainties indeed ! Thou wilt get nothing better than flat oaten cakes here .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>

      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Cudred</speaker>
       <p>Switha , I have brought thee home a guest who will be glad to partake of our supper .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Switha</speaker>
       <p>A guest ! And thinkest thou I 've naught better to do than broil fish and bake cakes for all the vagabonds who roam the land ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Cudred</speaker>
       <p>Patience , good Switha . I have not asked thee to cook for a vagabond . This is an honest Saxon whom it will be charity to feed and shelter for the night .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Switha</speaker>
       <p>Let me hold the torch and see this Saxon guest . Thou lookest like a guest of fashion , sorry fellow !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Cudred</speaker>
       <p>Cease thy scolding talk , woman ! I see by this light that our guest hath not been used to beg for charity from such as thou . Why be so hard of heart and by thy rude taunts make bitter the food he must receive from our hands ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Switha</speaker>
       <p>I have heard that charity begins at home , and I am sure we are poor enough .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Cudred</speaker>
       <p>Not poor enough to refuse food to the hungry , such as it is . Here is fish , and here an oaten cake which you wish to taste .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Alfred</speaker>
       <p>Thanks for your goodness , kind host . Indeed , I am hungry .</p>

       <speaker>Alfred</speaker>
       <p>And now I am hungry no longer . I thank you both for a good supper , and I hope you will never be sorry you have given charity to a stranger . Now , Cudred , I shall be glad to sleep .</p>

       <p>This way , then , to the bed of straw . Now , tell me truly , art thou not some mighty earl in disguise ?</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>Alfred</speaker>
       <p>I am Alfred , thy king — I know from thy goodness to me when thou thoughtest me a beggar that thou art a good man , therefore I confide in thee . I know thou wilt not betray thy king .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Cudred</speaker>
       <p>Not all the gold of Denmark should tempt me to commit so base a crime , but we must not let Switha know who thou art , my royal master .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Alfred</speaker>
       <p>I shall be careful . Soon , I hope , my friends will bring me word that my army awaits me , when I shall again try to set my country free .</p>

       <p>Turn them often before the fire , thus , so that they will not burn . Now I will go for more wood for the fire .</p>

       <speaker>Alfred</speaker>
       <p>How long , I wonder , must I remain in hiding . It is very hard to wait . If only I knew how my people were faring . Will the time never come when I can rule over England and unite my people ? So many plans have I for their happiness and progress . Schools we must have . The Bible must be translated for the people to read . Roads must be built and the country made safe for all . How long must I sit in Cudred 's cottage mending arrows when my heart wishes to help my suffering people ! Switha<stage>running in</stage>I thought I smelled them burning ! Oh , thou lazy , useless fellow ! Thou art ready enough to eat the cakes , but too lazy to keep them from burning . No wonder thou hast no home , idle as thou art .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Alfred</speaker>
       <p>I pray thee , good dame , forgive me . I was lost in thought of happier days and forgot my duty . Really I am sorry .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>Switha</speaker>
       <p>Ay , ay , that is always the way with thee . That smooth tongue of thine is better to thee than silver or gold ; for it obtains for thee food , lodging , and friends , and softens all the wrath thy faults provoke . However , I shall set by all the burnt cakes for thy portion of the week 's bread , I promise thee ; and thou shalt have no other till they are all eaten .</p>

       <p>No , indeed ! I have enough to do with feeding one vagrant without adding all the lazy pilgrims who pass by .</p>

       <p>My tidings , royal Alfred , are these : Hubba , the Dane , the terror of England , is slain , and his banner of the Raven waves in my father 's hall !</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>Alfred</speaker>
       <p>What ? Is thy father 's castle in the possession of the Danes ?</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>Odulph</speaker>
       <p>Not so , my royal master ; but the banner of the Danes , captured by your victorious Saxons , hangs in his hall . We were pent up in the castle by the Danes till our provisions failed . When the last loaf was eaten , and our archers had launched their last arrows , my valiant father led the garrison in an attack upon the foe .</p>

       <speaker>Odulph</speaker>
       <p>Yes , because of the carelessness of the Danes . They believed they had us in their power , and they never dreamed we would leave the castle walls . Few as we were , we fell upon them and slew their chiefs . The soldiers fled , and left our men victorious . Then my father raised the cry , “ Alfred the king ! ” All the country is calling , “ Alfred the king ! ”</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Alfred</speaker>
       <p>The time is ripe . I thank you , Odulph . Your father is a noble man , and I shall know how to show a king 's gratitude to you both . Shall we go ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Odulph</speaker>
       <p>Lead on , King Alfred , England is ready . Soon you shall head your army shouting , “ Long live King Alfred ! ”</p>

      <castItem>
       <role>Robin Hood . This feather is too short . Give me another</role>
       <roleDesc>Little John . This is a better one</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Midge . Making arrows is not a simple thing</role>
       <roleDesc>is it , my master ?</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Robin Hood . Indeed , no ; if the feathers be too short , the arrows will not keep true to their course ; and if the feathers be too long , the arrows will not fly swiftly</role>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Little John . If all men knew how to make arrows , their skill in shooting would seem greater . Look to your arrows , say I , before you shoot</role>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Will Scarlet . We should thank the gray goose for the even growth of her feathers</role>
       <roleDesc>which carries our arrows straight to the mark</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Robin Hood . First the strong bow that bends to our hand , then the straight arrow , tough and trim , and the feathers that wing it to its mark . But best of all the steady hand and keen eye that direct our winged shaft . But you have worked well this morning , my men , and now we may rest awhile . Sing us a song , Will Scarlet , while we lie beneath the friendly oak</role>

       <roleDesc>And it is well-nigh day ; And Harry our king has gone hunting To bring his deer to bay</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>The east is bright with morning light ,</role>
       <roleDesc>And darkness , it is fled ; And the merry horn wakes up the morn To leave his idle bed</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Awake , all men ! I say again</role>
       <roleDesc>Be merry as you may ! For Harry our king is gone hunting To bring the deer to bay</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Little John . This song is well enough in its way</role>
       <roleDesc>but for me , I should much prefer a good dinner . The morning 's work has given me a fine appetite and I long for food</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Robin Hood . It is good to eat , but not before we find some rich traveler to pay the bill . Ride out , my man , and find us a host . Willing or unwilling , bid him come</role>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Little John . With right good will</role>
       <roleDesc>my master ; and may I soon meet with him !</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Robin Hood . Remember well , no farmer shall you bring . He works for what he gets and shall live in peace . And the laborer who toils for wife and child you must not harm . Only those who oppress the poor and weak , those who are selfish and unkind , who play while others weep , these shall you bring to me</role>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Will Scarlet . But look , my master , what sorrowing knight rides there ? His garments are rich and his horse gayly decked , but his countenance is sad and he rides slowly , careless of the way</role>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Little John . Hail</role>
       <roleDesc>gentle knight ; my master awaits you and fain would have your company at dinner</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>The Knight . At dinner</role>
       <roleDesc>— in the wood ! Who is your master ?</roleDesc>

      <castItem>
       <role>Little John . Robin Hood is he : and here he is to bid you welcome</role>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Robin Hood . Welcome , Sir Knight , thrice welcome art thou , for I have fasted beyond the dinner hour . Pray you , dismount</role>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>The Knight . God save you and all your company !</role>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Midge . The dinner is served</role>
       <roleDesc>my master</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Robin Hood . Will you join us</role>
       <roleDesc>Sir Knight ? Here are pheasants and swans and meat of the deer</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>The Knight . Such a good dinner , with so many brave men , I have not eaten for many a day . If I come again to this country , I will make thee as good a dinner . But Heaven knows when that will be !</role>

      <p>Illustration ] Robin Hood . Thanks for your kind offer . But in the greenwood our guests must pay for their food . A yeoman does not pay for a rich knight ! The Knight . Sorry am I that you must call me poor . I would that I could pay you , but in my saddlebags are no more than ten shillings . Robin Hood . Is that indeed the truth , Sir Knight ? Look carefully , Little John ; if the knight speaks truly , he shall keep the ten shillings , but if not — Little John . Indeed , my master , the knight speaks truly , for this is all the money I can find . Robin Hood . How comes it , noble knight , that thou art so poor ? Come , tell me the story . Mayhap I can help thee . The Knight . I am Sir Richard of Lea , and my ancestors have been knights for a hundred years . A year ago I had plenty of money to spend as I would . But now I have nothing for my wife and my children , who weep for my absence from them . Robin Hood . But how did you lose all your money ? The Knight . Perhaps you will think I lost it in a foolish way . My son , whom I dearly love , is a manly youth . Well can he shoot and joust fairly in the field . But once , in a quarrel , he slew a youth , and to save him , I pledged all my lands . Unless I redeem them by All Saints Day I shall lose them all . Robin Hood . What is the sum you are bound to pay ? The Knight . Four hundred pounds . The day is near and I have nothing . Robin Hood . But what canst thou do if thou losest thy land ? What wilt thou do ? The Knight . I will sail far away over the seas . I cannot remain in England . Robin Hood . It is a small sum . Hast thou no friends to help thee in thy need ? The Knight . Many friends had I when I had money and lands . Now when I need their help they turn away and know me not . Robin Hood . By my faith , gentle knight , thou shalt not want for a friend . Little John , go to the chest and count out four hundred pounds . Will Scarlet . Shall he not have cloth for a coat , gentle master ? He is thinly clad . Robin Hood . Well said , Will Scarlet ; go , get three measures of every kind , that he may be warmly and gayly clad . Little John . Here is the money , Robin Hood , and good measure . Robin Hood . And what will you give , Little John , who are so generous with my money ? Little John . A pair of golden spurs , that he may ride fast to his castle and redeem his lands . The Knight . Many thanks , Little John , and to you , my good friend . Tell me , Robin Hood , when shall I come to return the money you so kindly lend me ? Robin Hood . This day twelvemonth ; and a happy year may it be ! We will meet under this trysting tree . Till then , be merry ! The Knight . I shall be with you a year from to-day . Farewell .</p>

      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Annette . What hast thou done</role>
       <roleDesc>my husband ?</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>William Tell . Perhaps thou wilt blame me</role>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Annette . Nay</role>
       <roleDesc>for thou art a good man , and whatever thou doest is right in my eyes</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>William Tell . Thou knowest how our foreign rulers oppress the good people of Switzerland ?</role>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Annette . I do</role>
       <roleDesc>but why should we poor peasants worry over the affairs of the nobles ?</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>William Tell . But they are our troubles , too . So to-night I have met with three and thirty men , brave and loyal hearts , who have sworn to resist our oppressors and free our land from tyranny</role>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Annette . But how can three-and-thirty men think to conquer the armies of foreign tyrants ?</role>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>William Tell . Sometimes great events are brought about by small means . All the people in their hearts hate the false ruler of our poor country</role>
       <roleDesc>and many of these will willingly die for her sake</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Annette . Thou art brave</role>
       <roleDesc>my husband , but what can so few do ?</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>William Tell . Think of it ! The father of one of our band has just been put to a cruel death . No man knows where the tyrant will strike next . Perhaps Gessler will pick me out for the next victim</role>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Annette . Thee ! What charge could he bring against thee ?</role>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>William Tell . He could say that I am the friend of my country</role>
       <roleDesc>which in the tyrant Gessler 's mind is a crime</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Annette . But Gessler will never hear of us</role>
       <roleDesc>humble peasants . He is too far above us to care what we think</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>William Tell . Not so</role>
       <roleDesc>my dear wife . Gessler will not permit us to hold our thoughts in secret . He has a plan to discover our inmost thoughts</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Annette . What plan can he make to read our minds ?</role>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>William Tell . A clever plan to tell a freeman from a slave . In Altdorf , our capital city , he has set up a pole . Upon the top of this pole he has put the cap of the Austrian king and has ordered every man to take off his hat as he passes by , to show that he yields to the Austrian rule . Is not this a brave plan ? He who obeys the tyrant is a slave . Wouldst thou have thy husband doff his cap to his country 's tyrant ?</role>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Annette . Never ! I should despise thee</role>
       <roleDesc>couldst thou do it !</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>William Tell . That is my own brave wife ! Thou speakest as a free woman</role>
       <roleDesc>the mother of free children , should speak . And our children shall be free ! When I go to Altdorf I shall refuse to obey the order of Gessler and all Switzerland shall know that William Tell will not bow to a foreign tyrant</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>Annette . But why go to Altdorf</role>
       <roleDesc>my husband ? Thou knowest the power of Gessler and his cruelty !</roleDesc>
      </castItem>
      <castItem>
       <role>William Tell . Wouldst have me a coward ? No</role>
       <roleDesc>dear wife . When my business calls me to Altdorf I shall go and in all ways act as a free man , loyal to my country and afraid of no one</roleDesc>

       <p>Come , my son , I have sold the chamois skins , and now I must buy the things your mother wished me to get for her .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Albert</speaker>
       <p>And , father , please buy some toys for little Lewis .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>William Tell</speaker>
       <p>You are a good boy , Albert , to remember your little brother . We will go to the shop across the square and look there for toys .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Soldier</speaker>
       <p>Halt , man ! Salute yonder cap !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>William Tell</speaker>
       <p>Why should I salute a cap of cloth ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Soldier</speaker>
       <p>It is the cap of our emperor . If you do not honor the cap , you are a traitor .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>William Tell</speaker>
       <p>I am no traitor , and yet I will not bow down to an empty cap . I am a true Swiss and love my country .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Gessler</speaker>
       <p>Ha , ha ! Then we have a traitor here who will not yield to our emperor ! Arrest him , my men ; and we will teach him his manners . Who is this man ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Soldier</speaker>
       <p>His name is William Tell , my lord .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Gessler</speaker>
       <p>Insolent traitor ! Bind him well .</p>

       <speaker>Albert</speaker>
       <p>Oh , father , I am afraid . Do not let the soldiers take me .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>William Tell</speaker>
       <p>Be calm , my son . No harm will come to thee .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Gessler</speaker>
       <p>Indeed , and is this your son ? Has he come to mock the cap of our royal master , too ? Seize the boy and bind him to yonder tree .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>William Tell</speaker>
       <p>What will you do with the boy ? Does a captain war with a child ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Gessler</speaker>
       <p>We shall see . I hear you are a famous shot , William Tell , and handle well the bow and arrow . We shall soon know your skill . Have you a good arrow in your quiver ? Perhaps you can shoot an apple from the head of your child .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Soldier</speaker>
       <p>Where shall I bind the boy , my captain ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Gessler</speaker>
       <p>To yonder tree . If his father shoots the apple from his child 's head , he shall go free . If he fails he must die . Are you ready ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>William Tell</speaker>
       <p>Rather would I die than risk killing my eldest son . Let him go , and take my life .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Gessler</speaker>
       <p>That I shall not do . You must both die unless you save your lives as I have said . Will you try the shot or are you afraid ?</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>William Tell</speaker>
       <p>Bind the boy 's eyes , I beg . He might move if he saw the arrow coming , and my skill would be in vain .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Gessler</speaker>
       <p>I am willing , for well I know you cannot cleave the apple at that distance .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>William Tell</speaker>
       <p>Tyrant ! I cannot fail now , when my son 's life depends upon me . Stand perfectly still , my brave boy , and father will not hurt you . Now I pray for strength — my trusty arrow must not fail me ! There !<stage>He shoots .</stage></p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Soldier</speaker>
       <p>See , my captain ! The apple is split ! That was a fine shot !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Gessler</speaker>
       <p>Yes , it was a good shot , and I did not believe anyone could make it . I suppose I must set you free . But why have you that other arrow in your hand ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>William Tell</speaker>
       <p>To shoot you with it had I killed my darling boy .</p>

      <speaker>Father Time</speaker>
      <p>I must call my children together and give them orders for the New Year . Open the door , my servants , and let the Seasons appear . Spring<stage>entering</stage>Here I am , Father Time . What are your commands for your youngest daughter ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Father Time</speaker>
      <p>Welcome , my dainty Spring ! It is your duty to call the gentle rains to fall upon the thirsting ground . Yours is the pleasant task to paint the blades of young grass a delicate green . You call the birds back from the south and rouse all nature from her winter sleep . The winds blow freshly over the earth ; the clouds move here and there , bringing the rain ; and the bulbs , hidden under the soil , slowly push their leaves into the sunlight . What flowers will you bring to deck the earth ?</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Illustration : TIME AND THE SEASONS</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Spring</speaker>
      <p>O Father Time ! Look here upon my pretty flowers ! Here is the snowdrop , so white and brave . It pushes its head up through the snow , which is no whiter than its own petals . And here I have a bunch of crocuses , blue , yellow , white , and of many colors . Are n't they pretty amid the grass ? Then the gorgeous tulips , holding their heads so high , making the earth brilliant with their gay , bright colors . I think the golden daffodils and sweet narcissus are my favorite flowers , though I am very fond of what the children call spring beauty .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Father Time</speaker>
      <p>I see , my daughter , that you love all your flower children , and that is right . All are beautiful , each in its own way . And now tell me what joys do you bring to the little children of the earth ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Spring</speaker>
      <p>All the children love me . They hunt for the first flowers , they welcome the first birds returning from the south , and they prepare the garden for the seeds of flowers and vegetables . The boys play marbles everywhere , and run and laugh , filling their lungs with my life-giving air . The organ grinder plays for the children and they dance on the sidewalks , singing and calling out in delight . The trees put forth their tender leaves . The sun fills the air with golden warmth , and the world seems full of promise .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Father Time</speaker>
      <p>Well done , my daughter . And now , my daughter Summer , tell me your plans for the year .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Summer</speaker>
      <p>Dear father , I delay my coming until Spring has prepared the way . The air must be soft and warm to please me , and the earth must be prepared by the rains and the warm rays of the sun . The colors of my flowers are deeper and richer than those of sister Spring . I bring the lilies , the peonies , and the poppies . Best of all , the glowing roses open at my call , and fill the air with perfume .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Father Time</speaker>
      <p>And the children , my fair daughter , what do you bring to them ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Summer</speaker>
      <p>The dear children ! I think they all like my sunny days and the long time for play . For July and August in many countries are given to the school children for their play time . Then they go to the seashore and play in the water and the sand ; or to the country , where the green grass , the farmyard animals , and all the country games delight them .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Father Time</speaker>
      <p>Children are so fond of play and the long summer days out-of-doors that I wonder what they think of you , my older daughter , Autumn ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Autumn</speaker>
      <p>Children do like to play and I am glad they get so well and strong with the vacation my sister , Summer , gives them . Yet all children like to learn , too . We must not forget that . What joy it is to read the beautiful stories that great men and women have written for them . What delight they have in learning to write , to sing , to draw , and to make pretty objects of paper , clay , and wood .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Father Time</speaker>
      <p>Yes , that is true , but have you no pleasures out-of-doors for them ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Autumn</speaker>
      <p>Some people say my days are the most pleasant of the year . The gardens have many beautiful flowers , and the fruits are ripening in the orchards and vineyards . The apples hang red on the boughs , and children like to pick them and eat them , too ! I have the harvest moon , the time when the farmers bring home the crops ripened by August suns , and the earth seems to gather the results of the year 's work , the riches of field , orchard , and meadow . The squirrels gather their hoard of nuts and hide them away for their winter 's food . Gay voices of nutting parties are heard in the woods , and all the air is filled with songs of praise and thanksgiving for the bounty of the year .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Father Time</speaker>
      <p>Your work is surely one of worth and I rejoice with you , my daughter , in your happiness . You are a true friend of men , showing them that honest effort and its work will always bring proper reward . Now , my merry laughing child , what have you to tell us ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Winter</speaker>
      <p>Some people think I am your oldest daughter , Father Time , but they forget that two of my months are always in the New Year . Although my hair and garments are white , the cold is only outside ; my heart is warm . Have I not jolly St. Nicholas who never grows old ? I cover the earth with my warmest blanket of softest snow , softer and whiter than ermine , and all the tender flowers sleep cozily and warm until sweet Spring awakes them . The children get out their sleds and skates , and the merry sleigh bells ring . What fun it is to build the snow man , and even if the hands get cold , the eyes shine brighter than in warm days and the cheeks are rosy as the reddest flower . “ Hurrah for Winter ! ” shout the boys . The merriest holidays I have when all hearts are gay and filled with loving care for others . I would not change , dear Father Time , with any of my sisters . I say good-by to the passing year and welcome the new year . If the old year has had troubles and sorrows , all the people turn with hope to the new , and call to one another the wish , “ A Happy New Year to all ! ”</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Father Time</speaker>
      <p>I am glad you are contented with the work you have to do . And now , my daughters , I must send you out upon your travels all over the world . May your coming bring peace ; joy , and prosperity to all mankind !</p>

      <stage>SCENE .— Home of Little Old Woman</stage>
      <stage>Little Old Woman . Now all my housework is done I think I will make some gingerbread . There is nothing quite so good for lunch as warm gingerbread and a glass of milk , or a cup of hot tea . I can make pretty good gingerbread , too , all of my friends say . Here is the flour and butter and molasses and milk . Now it is all ready to put into the pan . But I made too much this time . What shall I do with it ? Nothing must be wasted in a good cook 's kitchen . Oh , I know ! I 'll make a cunning gingerbread man for the little boy who lives next door .</stage>
      <stage>Where is my knife ? Now roll the dough very thin , cut out the round little head , then the neck , now the two arms , now the little fat body , and last the legs with high heels on the shoes . Well , this certainly is a fine little gingerbread man . I think I 'll make a little hat with a wide brim . Now I 'll put two currants for his eyes , two for his nose , three for his cute little mouth , and six for the buttons on his coat .</stage>
      <stage>Then I 'll sprinkle sugar and cinnamon over him and put him in the oven to bake .</stage>
      <stage>Let me look at the clock . It is half past eleven . At twelve the gingerbread man will be baked , ready for the little boy when he comes home from school .</stage>
      <stage>Well , I 've washed the dishes , and set the table for my lunch , and it is now just twelve o'clock . I 'll open the oven door and see if my gingerbread man is ready .</stage>
      <stage>Oh ! what was that ! Why , it is the gingerbread man !</stage>
     </stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Gingerbread Man</speaker>
      <p>Yes , it is the gingerbread man , and now I 'll go and see the world . Little Old Woman . Go ! you must n't go ! You belong to me . Gingerbread Man . Ah , ha ! ah , ha ! catch me , if you can ! You can n't catch me , I 'm a gingerbread man ! Little Old Woman . There he goes , out of the door , just as if he were really a little boy , and not made of something good to eat ! Come back ; come back ! Gingerbread Man . Ah , ha ! ah , ha ! catch me , if you can ! You can n't catch me , I 'm a gingerbread man ! Little Old Woman . I know I can n't run as fast as he can . There he goes out of the gate . There are some men who are working in the street . I 'll ask them to catch him . Help ! help me catch the gingerbread man !</p>

      <speaker>Men</speaker>
      <p>Well , there he goes and he does run fast ! Come , let us run after him ! Little Old Woman . Oh , I know the men can n't run as fast as he can , and they will never catch my gingerbread man ! Here are the children coming from school . I 'll call them . Children , children !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Children</speaker>
      <p>Yes , little old woman , here we are . What did you call us for ? Little Old Woman . Oh , my dear children , see the gingerbread man I made for the little boy next door ! There he goes running as fast as he can , and I can n't catch him !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Boy</speaker>
      <p>And the men are running after him , and they can n't catch him either . Just watch me , little woman , I 'll catch him for you . Gingerbread Man . Ah , ha ! ah , ha ! catch me , if you can ! You can n't catch me , I 'm a gingerbread man .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Girl</speaker>
      <p>I have my roller skates on . Perhaps I can catch him ! Little Old Woman . I 'm sure you can , my child .</p>

      <speaker>Girl</speaker>
      <p>I 'll try . Look out , Mr . Gingerbread Man ! Gingerbread Man . Ah , ha ! ah , ha ! catch me , if you can ! You can n't catch me , I 'm a gingerbread man ! Little Old Woman . There he goes , and none of them can catch him . Now he is near some farmers . I 'll call on them to help me . Farmer , farmer , will you please help me catch the gingerbread man ? There he goes over your wheat field .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>Farmer</speaker>
      <p>Yes , indeed , we 'll help you . Here , you gingerbread man , keep out of my wheat field ! Come , men ; run after him and catch him .</p>

      <speaker>Men</speaker>
      <p>We 'll catch him before he gets to the fence .<stage>Illustration</stage>Gingerbread Man . Ah , ha ! ah , ah ! catch me , if you can ! You can n't catch me , I 'm a gingerbread man !

     <div type="scene" n="1">
      <head type="scene">SCENE I .— In the Wood</head>
      <stage type="setting">
       <stage>The Good Fairy . At last I am in this wood where I must save the Lady Alice from danger . How dark it seems here after the bright light of my skyey home . Surely I shall be glad to return to the courts of fairyland . Yet it is pleasant to be of service to the young and innocent , to those who are good and true . Some there are on earth who do not love the truth , who do not do the things that are honest and kind , and they must be punished . Kind and gentle deeds must be rewarded with our help .</stage>
       <stage>Here in this dark grove dwells Comus , an evil spirit , who loves not the good . Here he finds the unlucky traveler and takes him to his court . There he offers him food and a pleasant drink . But in the glass is a potion which drives memory from the mind and makes one forget home and friends . Then the unhappy traveler loses his human head and must have the head of some animal or bird . Comus enjoys seeing his victims act like wild and foolish animals or the forest .</stage>
       <stage>In this dangerous wood the Lady Alice and her brothers are wandering , and my duty it is to protect them from the evil Comus . Hark ! I think I hear the noisy band . Here will I hide and listen .</stage>
      </stage>
      <stage>Comus and his crew enter ; men and women with animal heads .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Comus</speaker>
       <p>Now the sun has gone from the western heavens and the star of night shines over us . This is the hour we love the best . All the serious , wise old people who love the day and its work are weary now and have gone to bed . We who love fun and a merry dance , we wake when the sky is flecked with golden stars . Now the moon calls the fairies from brook and fountain to play their merry games and sing . These are the joys of night in our dark and secret grove . Come , make a merry ring and dance . No care have we nor fear . We will dance and sing until the first ray of light is seen in the east .</p>
      </sp>
      <stage>They dance until Comus speaks .</stage>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Comus</speaker>
       <p>Break off ! break off ! I hear a footstep not our own approaching this place . Run to your places lest you frighten the traveler whoever it may be .<stage>They disappear .</stage>I believe some maiden approaches . I will weave my spells and appear to her in the dress of a shepherd and she will not be afraid . Here she comes . I will step aside and learn how she happens to be alone in my grove .<stage>Comus hides .</stage>Lady Alice<stage>entering</stage>I thought I heard the sound of noisy merrymaking ,— with music as if many were dancing . Here was the sound , but here I see no one . Alas ! I should be sorry to meet rude youths , but where can I go , what can I do , left alone in this dark and gloomy wood ? O my brothers , where are you ? When they saw me wearied , unable to go farther , they left to find me nourishment and shelter , promising soon to return . Truly they must be lost in this vast forest . O dark night , why have you stolen the way from them and left me alone and helpless ? Helpless ? No , not helpless , for the good mind has helpers ever present in pure-eyed Faith and white-handed Hope . I will pray to God , who will send me a guardian to guide me to my home . What is that light I see ? My brothers seek me and I will sing to them . Perhaps they are not far away and will hear my voice . Sweet Echo , sweetest nymph , that liv'st unseen Within thy airy shell , Canst thou not tell me of a gentle pair That likest thy Narcissus are ? O if thou have Hid them in some flowery cave , Tell me but where , Sweet Queen of Parley , Daughter of the Sphere ! Comus<stage>to himself</stage>What sweet song is this ? Can any mortal sing with such charm and beauty ? Such sacred and home-felt delight I never heard till now . I 'll speak to her , and she shall be my queen . Comus<stage>dressed as a shepherd</stage>Hail , fair goddess ! for you must be more than mortal , to sing such sweet and wondrous strain .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>Lady Alice</speaker>
       <p>Nay , gentle shepherd . I sang not as loving my own voice , and praise is lost that falls on unattending ears . Stern necessity compelled my song .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Comus</speaker>
       <p>How comes it , Lady , that you are thus alone ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Lady Alice</speaker>
       <p>My brothers left me upon a grassy turf . Darkness came upon the grove , and I fear they are lost .</p>

       <p>Young and fair my brothers are .</p>

       <p>Two such I saw , so lovely in their youthful grace I thought I looked upon some fairy scene . If these are the lads you seek , we can easily find them .</p>

       <p>Gentle villager , quickly tell me the shortest way to them !</p>

       <p>Due west it lies .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Lady Alice</speaker>
       <p>To find it out , good shepherd , would be too difficult in this darkness to a stranger .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Comus</speaker>
       <p>I know every step , fair lady , for I live close by and daily tread the path in caring for my sheep . Gladly will I conduct you and find your brothers if they are still in this grove . Till daybreak you can rest in a cottage near by , where you will be safe until you wish to travel on .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Lady Alice</speaker>
       <p>Kind shepherd , I take your word , and gladly go to the shelter you mention . Kindness is often found in lowly homes . Lead on , and I will follow .</p>

       <speaker>Comus</speaker>
       <p>This way , fair lady !</p>

       <speaker>Elder Brother</speaker>
       <p>How our steps are stayed by the darkness of the night and of the forest . Would that the moon and stars would pierce the clouds ! If only we could see some faint glimmer of a candle in some lowly hut that would guide us on our way .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Second Brother</speaker>
       <p>Or hear the folded flocks , or sound of village flute or song , or if the cock would crow the watches of the night ! Where can our dear sister be now ? Does she wander in the deep grove , or against the rugged bark of some broad elm lean her head in fear ? Perhaps even while we speak she is the prey of some savage beast !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Elder Brother</speaker>
       <p>Cease , brother , to dream of evils that may not be . No good can come from false alarms . I do not believe my good sister has lost herself in fear . Her faith will keep her calm .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Second Brother</speaker>
       <p>I do not fear the darkness and the fact that she is alone . But I do fear some harm may come to her from rude wanderers in the wood .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Elder Brother</speaker>
       <p>Yet I believe she is so good and true that evil has no power to harm her . All powers of good surround her and drive evil away . But list ! Some faint call sounds on my ear .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Second Brother</speaker>
       <p>Yes , I hear it now . What should it be ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Elder Brother</speaker>
       <p>Either some one lost in this wood , like ourselves , or else some roving woodman , or perhaps some robber calling to his fellows !</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Second Brother</speaker>
       <p>God save my sister !</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>Elder Brother</speaker>
       <p>Who comes here ? Speak ! Advance no further ! Spirit<stage>as a shepherd</stage>What voice is that ? Speak once again .</p>

       <p>O brother ! ‘ tis my father 's shepherd , sure .</p>

       <p>Are you Thyrsis ? How could you find this dark , secluded spot ? Why did you come ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Spirit</speaker>
       <p>To find out you . But where is your lovely sister ? Why is she not with you ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Elder Brother</speaker>
       <p>Without our fault we lost her as we came .</p>
      </sp>

       <speaker>Spirit</speaker>
       <p>Alas , then my fears are true !</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>Elder Brother</speaker>
       <p>What fears , good Thyrsis ?</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Spirit</speaker>
       <p>I have long known that this wood was held in the power of an evil spirit , and this evening as I sat me down upon a bank I heard most lovely strains as if an angel sang . Listening , I knew it was your sister 's voice . I hastened to her and heard her tell Comus of you whom she had lost . To you I came that we may save her from the evil spirit of the wood .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Elder Brother</speaker>
       <p>Let us hasten to attack him with our swords .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Spirit</speaker>
       <p>Alas ! Your bravery I praise , but it is vain . The evil charm of Comus can be broken only by a wondrous plant . See , I have it here . With this will we overcome his fairy spells .</p>
      </sp>
      <sp>
       <speaker>Elder Brother</speaker>
       <p>Thyrsis , lead on ! And some good angel bear a shield before us !</p>

       <p>Drink , Lady , of the wine . You are faint and weary , and this will refresh you . Do not refuse !</p>

       <speaker>Lady Alice</speaker>
       <p>Never will I drink the potion in that glass . You may control the body , but my free mind you can never bind .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>Lady Alice</speaker>
       <p>Cease your words . You cannot move the mind guided by honesty and truth . You cannot frighten me , for well I know goodness is stronger than evil , truth is more powerful than falsehood . The pure heart cannot be harmed .</p>

       <p>Have you let him escape ? You should have seized his wand . Without that he has no power , but now we must have help to release your sister from his wicked power . The goddess of our river Severn , the lovely Sabrina , has power over all the enchantments of Comus . Her will I call . Sabrina fair , Listen , where thou art sitting , Goddess of the silver lake , Listen and save . Come from your home in the coral caves of the sea and help this lovely maiden in distress . Sabrina<stage>entering</stage>From off the waters fleet , Thus I set my printless feet O'er the cowslip 's velvet head That bends not as I tread ; Gentle swain , at thy request I am here !</p>

       <speaker>Sabrina</speaker>
       <p>‘ Tis my greatest joy to help the pure and good . Gentle Lady , look on me . Thrice upon thy finger tips , thrice upon thy lips , I sprinkle drops from my pure fountain . Then I touch this marble seat and break the spell . All is well . Farewell .</p>

      <sp>
       <speaker>Spirit</speaker>
       <p>Fair Sabrina , for this aid I pray that all the pretty rills will never cease to flow into your broad river . May your banks ever be fair with groves and meadows sweet , while all men shall praise you for your gentle deeds . Farewell . Now , Lady , let us hasten from this grove . Your parents await their dear children , and we must hasten ere they become alarmed over your delay . Thanks to your pure heart and the aid of the fair Sabrina , you have come safely through the enchanter 's wood .</p>
