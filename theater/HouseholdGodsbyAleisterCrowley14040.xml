    <p>THE SCENE is at the hearth of CRASSUS , where is a little bronze altar dedicated to the Lares and Penates . A pale flame rises from the burning sandal-wood , on which CRASSUS throws benzoin and musk . He is standing in deep dejection .</p>
   </set>

  <body>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <p>Smoke without fire ! No thrill of tongues licks up The offerings in the cup . Dead falls desire . Black smoke thou art , O altar-flame , that dost dismember , Devour the hearth , to leave no ember To warm this heart . I see her still -  Adela dancing here Till dim gods did appear To work our will . The delicate girl ! Diaphanous gossamer Subtly revealing her Brave breast of pearl ! Now -  she 's withdrawn At dusk to the wild woods , Mystic beatitudes That dure till dawn . Let life exclaim Against these things of spirit , Mankind that disinherit Of love 's pure flame !<stage>He bends before the altar and begins to weep .</stage>Ye household gods ! By these male tears I swear That ye shall grant this prayer . All things at odds Shall be put straight -  Harmonized , reconciled By some appointed child Of some far Fate !<stage>A curtain has been drawn aside during this invocation , and ALICIA advances . She smiles subtly upon him ; and , giving a strange gesture , makes one or two noiseless steps of dancing .</stage></p>

    <p>Master still sad ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>These faint and fearful shores</l>
     <l>Of time are beaten by the surge of sense ,</l>
     <l>Love worn away -  by love ? - to indifference .</l>
     <l>Who knows what god -  or demon -  she adores ?</l>
     <l>Or in what wood she shelters , or what grove</l>
     <l>Sees her profane our sacrament of love ?</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <p>I saw her follow The stream in the hollow Where never Apollo Abides . So thick are the trees That never the breeze Stirs them , or sees What satyr inhabits the glen , what nymph in the pools of it hides . Lighter of foot Than a sylph or a fairy , Sinuous , wary , I passed from the airy Lawns , where the flute Of the winds made tremulous music for man . I followed the ripple Of the stream ; I crept Where the waters wept -  The floss in the foss Gurgling across The bosses of moss , Like a dryad 's nipple In the mouth of Pan !</p>

    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <p>O pearl of the house ! you came to the end ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <p>The dusk of the slave , the dawn of a friend ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <p>Freedom is thine for the skill and the will .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>The skill is mine -  but the will lies still ,</l>
     <l>Still as the earth that dare not stir</l>
     <l>Till the kiss of the sun awaken her !</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <p>Yet at these secrets and riddles ? Behold ! I can fill thy lap with a harvest of gold .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Yet all the gold you could give to me</l>
     <l>Would fall at my feet when I rose to be free .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <p>What will you then ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>No gift from men .</l>
     <l>Of my own free will I give you wit ,</l>
     <stage>O man so sorely in need of it !</stage>
     <l>And happiness ; and the flame that hath dwindled</l>
     <l>On this dull hearth shall be rekindled .</l>
     <l>But this you must swear :</l>
     <l>To will , and to dare ,</l>
     <l>To seek the spirit and slay the sense ;</l>
     <l>And for this hour</l>
     <l>To give me power</l>
     <l>To lead you in silent obedience ,</l>
     <l>Though I bade you fall on your sword ....</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <p>Enough ! I give my life as I gave my love .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>O ! love you have not understood .</l>
     <l>You have not guessed its secret food .</l>
     <l>You have not seen its single eye ;</l>
     <l>But fear and doubt and jealousy</l>
     <l>Have risen , and now your love is trembling</l>
     <l>Like a mountebank dissembling</l>
     <l>When his trick 's detected . Come !</l>
     <l>To find home we must leave home .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Starless and moonless , hidden in cloud ,</l>
     <l>The night 's one flame of pearl .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <p>The bat flaps ; the owl hoots aloud .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <p>Lead on ; I trust you , girl .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>You are bold to trust me ; or , have you divined</l>
     <l>My secret ?</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>No ; the crystal of your mind</l>
     <l>Shows only faint disturbing images ,</l>
     <l>Things passing strange , as if enchanted seas</l>
     <l>Kept their great swell upon it , and strange fish</l>
     <l>Played in its oily depths . Some monstrous wish ,</l>
     <l>The shadow of some unspeakable desire ,</l>
     <l>Strikes my heart cold , and sets my brain on fire .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Learn this , as we pass through the portico :</l>
     <l>Fear nothing ; there is nothing you can know !</l>
     <l>And by these terraces and steps that gleam</l>
     <l>Wintry , although the summer night is hot ,</l>
     <l>This -  what we seek is never what we find !</l>
     <l>Life is a dream , like love ; and from the dream</l>
     <l>If we may wake , we never find it what</l>
     <l>We would ; for the wisdom of a mightier mind</l>
     <l>Leads us in its own ways</l>
     <l>To a perfected praise .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Why are these shadows thrown across the lawn</l>
     <l>From the elms and yews ? They were not wont to reach</l>
     <l>Beyond the branches of that copper-beech .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Attend the dawn</l>
     <l>Of an unknown comet , that shall come</l>
     <l>From the unfathomable wells of space</l>
     <l>Into its halidom .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>I know it not . Last night I walked alone</l>
     <l>Here , and saw nothing .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>I was not with you !</l>
     <l>There is no God upon the eternal throne</l>
     <l>Of stars begemming the bewildering blue</l>
     <l>Unless one has the eyes to see him . Think</l>
     <l>How we two stand upon the brink</l>
     <l>Of nothing ! Here 's a globe , whereto we trust ,</l>
     <l>No larger than the smallest speck of dust</l>
     <l>Or mote in the sunbeam is to that sun 's self ,</l>
     <l>And we are like dead leaves in autumn 's whil</l>
     <l>Of wind upon it .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Mystify me , girl !</l>
     <l>It is the right of an elf .</l>
     <l>Surely your flickering fire</l>
     <l>Will draw me to some mire !</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Here the stream dips its mouth into the wood .</l>
     <l>So does youth 's calm and chaste beatitude</l>
     <l>Touch the black mouth of Love , the ancient whore .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <p>Girl ! what a scorpion leaping from your lips !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <p>My mouth stings as no scorpion ever stang . in this round impudent smiling face of mine There is a poison fiercer than all wine ; And from these eyes more subtle sorrows pour Than you can dream . These teeth have been at grips With gods ; I have sung what no girl ever sang . These ears have heard An insufferable word !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <p>What do you mean ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>The secret 's in a kiss .</l>
     <l>Here are no kisses . Here great Artemis</l>
     <l>Rules ; only in the woodland may a man</l>
     <l>Hide his eyes from her , pledge himself to Pan .</l>
     <l>Come ! through the tangled arches</l>
     <l>Of cypresses and larches ,</l>
     <l>Stoop ; under Artemis we walked upright ;</l>
     <l>But this is Pan 's home , and the House of Night .</l>
     <stage>They enter the wood .</stage>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <p>So when I stoop , my cheek comes close to yours . Give me a kiss .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>The poisonous apple lures</l>
     <l>Thus the boy 's mouth . Beware !</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>O you are fair !</l>
     <l>Fairer than ever ! In this tangle of trees</l>
     <l>Your hot breath wraps you in perfume .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>There is some gloom or doom ,</l>
     <l>A bitter harsh ingredient</l>
     <l>In these my sorceries</l>
     <l>Of animal scent .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <p>Yes ! there is fear mixed with the fascination . It is the reverence that chastity , be sure ! Gains from the impure .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>O virtuous nation !</l>
     <l>It is the fear of the uninitiate</l>
     <l>Before the throne of Fate</l>
     <l>The hierophant .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <p>Kiss me , however !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Did I grant</l>
     <l>This favour , all were lost . It is your truth</l>
     <l>To Adela that tempts my youth .</l>
     <stage>Henceforth Alicia shakes with silent laughter .</stage>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <p>What little breasts you have !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <p>Ay , maiden breasts ! Would you betray my oath ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>My will contests</l>
     <l>My wishes .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Wait , and you shall surely see</l>
     <l>Part of the secret that ensorcels me .</l>
     <l>See all these bosses ! It is not</l>
     <l>As if a Titan smote himself into the earth ,</l>
     <l>And was caught into her , made one with her ?</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>The scent is fierce and hot</l>
     <l>Like a rutting panther 's slot .</l>
     <l>Yet you are matched with mirth ,</l>
     <l>Shaking each other like two wrestlers .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>What should stir</l>
     <l>Your melancholy but laughter ?</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Look , before us</l>
     <l>Light streams , a tremulous chorus .</l>
     <l>Oh , it is vague and vacillating !</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Love ,</l>
     <l>Young love of maidens , is the soul thereof .</l>
     <l>And in the midst , behold , O man !</l>
     <l>The image of great Pan .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <p>I fear him .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Go and lie there , at his feet .</l>
     <l>Lie supine ! Lie on that moss-covered root ,</l>
     <l>While I draw forth the flute</l>
     <l>And make a marvellous music .</l>
     <stage>She ceases laughing and begins to play .</stage>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>O I writhe</l>
     <l>Beneath the force of lips , of fingers lithe</l>
     <l>That touch the delicate stops so delicately .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <p>Hush ! I have drawn the bird from the bush . Pan will appear anon .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <p>Ah ! Ah ! ... Ah ! Ah !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>This music moves you . Now I 'll play a tune</l>
     <l>That would make mad the melancholy moon .</l>
     <l>This .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Ah ! you tear my soul out with the trills .</l>
     <l>Your fingers play like summer lightning on the shaft .</l>
     <l>It is like a storm on the mountains when it shrills ;</l>
     <l>Like the angry sea when it booms . Hark !</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <p>Some god laughed .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Your mouth is like some god 's It burns and blooms</l>
     <l>With fire unheard of , with unguessed perfumes .</l>
     <l>O let me kiss you !</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <p>So you stop my song !<stage>She ceases the tune .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <p>There is another song .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <p>You do me wrong . For you love Adela !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <p>By God , girl , no ! I love Alicia .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <p>Ah ! you love her SO !<stage>She laughs</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <p>Your laugh is shocking -  why do you mock me , dear ?</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Because you will not guess my secret here .</l>
     <l>But -  put your arms about my neck , and swar</l>
     <l>You love me , and will always keep them there .</l>
     <l>Then I might dare .</l>
    </lg>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <p>I swear it . O my sweet !</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <p>Then take my kiss .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <p>Your mouth is like a rose of fire . But what is this ? I cannot bear it .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <p>Ai ! Uhu ! Uhu ! It is my heart ; this arrow strikes me through . Stir not one muscle for a moment . Death ! You beast , you kill me with your urgent breath .</p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>CRASSUS</speaker>
    <p>O how I love you !<stage>He moves violently .</stage></p>
   </sp>
   <sp>
    <speaker>ALICIA</speaker>
    <lg>
     <l>Fool ! Now all my pain</l>
     <l>Must be gone through again .</l>
     <l>It is sure your chastity 's unstained by crime ;</l>
     <l>You do the wrong thing just at the right time !</l>
