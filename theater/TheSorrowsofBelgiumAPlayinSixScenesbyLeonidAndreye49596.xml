    <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
    <p n="1">Leonid Andreyev , the great Russian writer , whose “ Anathema , ” “ The Seven Who Were Hanged , ” “ The Life of Man ” and “ Red Laughter ” have attracted universal attention , has now written the story of the sorrows of the Belgian people . He delineates the tragedy of Belgium as reflected in the home of the foremost Belgian poet and thinker — regarded as the conscience of the Belgian nation .</p>
    <p n="2">Leonid Andreyev feels deeply and keenly for the oppressed and weaker nationalities . He has depicted the victims of this war with profound sympathy ,— the Belgians , and in another literary masterpiece he analyzed the sufferings of the Jews in Russia as a result of this war . He described vividly the sense of shame of the Russian people on account of the Russian official anti-Jewish policies .</p>
    <p n="3">In both these works Leonid Andreyev holds German militarism and German influences responsible for the wrongs committed against smaller nationalities .</p>
    <p n="4">In his treatise on the tragedy of the Jews in Russia , he writes of “ Russian barbarians ” and “ German barbarians ” as follows :</p>
    <p n="5">“ If for the Jews themselves the Pale of Settlement , the per cent norm and other restrictions were a fatal fact , which distorted all their life , it has been for me , a Russian , something like a hunch on my back , a monstrous growth , which I received I know not when and under what conditions . But wherever I may go and whatever I may do the hunch is always with me ; it has disturbed my sleep at night , and in my waking hours , in the presence of people , it has filled me with a sensation of confusion and shame ....</p>
    <p n="6">“ It is necessary for all to understand that the end of Jewish sufferings is the beginning of our self-respect , without which Russia cannot live . The dark days of the war will pass and the German barbarians ’ of today will once more become cultured Germans whose voice will again be heard throughout the world . And it is essential that neither their voice nor any other voice should call us loudly ‘ Russian barbarians . ’ ”</p>
    <p n="7">Aside from its literary and dramatic value , if this volume on the sorrows of Belgium will tend to arouse a little more sympathy for the sufferings of the victims of the war , or if it will help to call forth in the minds of the people a stronger abhorrence of the horrors of war , it will have served an important and worthy purpose .</p>

    <head type="scene">SCENE I</head>
    <stage type="setting">
     <stage>The action takes place in Belgium , at the beginning of the war of 1914 . The scene represents a garden near the villa of the famous Belgian author , Emil Grelieu . Beyond the tops of low trees , beyond the stone fence which divides Grelieu 's estate from the neighboring gardens , are seen the outlines of the red roofs of the houses in the small town , of the Town Hall , and of an ancient church . There the people already know about the war ; there the church bells are ringing uneasily , while in the garden there is still peace . A small , splendidly kept flower garden ; beautiful and fragrant flowers ; shrubbery in bloom ; a nook of a hothouse . The glass covers are half open . The sun is shining softly ; there is in the air the bluish mist of a warm and quiet day , and all colors seem tenderly soft ; only in the foreground the colors of the flowers stand out in sharp relief .</stage>
     <stage>François is sitting and clipping roses at one of the flower beds . He is an old and deaf , stern Belgian , with long , gray hair . He holds in his mouth an earthen pipe . François is working . He does not hear the tolling of the bells . He is alone in the garden , and it seems to him that all is calm and quiet .</stage>
     <stage>But something fills him with faint alarm . He hears an indistinct call . He looks around — but sees no one . He hums to himself a song without words . Suddenly he stops , straightens himself , holding the scissors in his hands , and looks around again .</stage>
    </stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FRANÇOIS</speaker>
     <p>Who has called me ? He sees no one . He looks at the hothouse — it seems to him that some one is calling him from there . I hear you , Monsieur Emil , I am here . He sees no one . He frowns and cries angrily . Who is calling me ? No one here . He looks at the sky , then at the flowers , and resumes his work quietly . They say I am deaf . But I heard some one calling me twice : “ François ! ” “ François ! ” No , perhaps it is my blood , making a noise in my ears . Silence . But his uneasiness does not subside ; he listens again . I can still hear some one calling me : “ François ! ” Very well ; here is François , and if anyone needs me he may call me again . I shall not run . I can n't hear the chirping of the birds ; the birds have long since become silent for me . What nonsense — these birds ! Very well , I am deaf — does anyone think I am going to cry over it ? Twitches his mouth into a smile . And my eyes ? That is another matter . My eyes ! Why are you forever silent , François ? Why should I speak if I do not hear your foolish answer ? It is all nonsense — to talk and to listen . I can see more than you can hear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Laughs</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I see this . This does not talk either , but bend down to it and you will learn more than Solomon ever knew . That is what the Bible says — Solomon . To you the earth is noise and prattle , while to me it is like a Madonna in colors upon a picture . Like a Madonna in colors . The bell is ringing . In the distance a youthful voice calls “ Papa ! ” “ Papa ! ” Then , “ François ! ” Maurice , Emil Grelieu 's younger son , a youth of about 17 , appears , coming quickly from the house . He calls François once more , but François does not hear . Finally he shouts right next to his ear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>François , what is the matter with you ? I am calling you . I am calling you . Have n't you seen papa ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FRANÇOIS</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Calmly , without turning around .</l>
      <l>Did you call me , Maurice ? I heard your call long ago .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>You heard me , but did not respond . How obstinate you are ! Have n't you seen papa ? I am looking for him everywhere . Quick ! Where is papa ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FRANÇOIS</speaker>
     <p>Papa ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Shouts . Where is papa ? Have n't you seen him ? Silvina says he went to the hothouse . Do you hear ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FRANÇOIS</speaker>
     <p>He is not there . I spoke to Monsieur this morning , but since then I have not seen him . No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>What is to be done ? How they are tolling ! François , what is to be done — do you hear them tolling ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FRANÇOIS</speaker>
     <p>Ah ! I hear . Will you take some roses , my boy ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>You do n't understand anything — you are beyond endurance ! They are running in the streets , they are all running there , and papa is not here . I will run over there , too , at once . Perhaps he is there . What a day !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FRANÇOIS</speaker>
     <p>Who is running ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>You do n't understand anything !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Shouts</speaker>
     <p>They have entered Belgium !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FRANÇOIS</speaker>
     <p>Who has entered Belgium ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>They — the Prussians . Ca n't you understand ? It 's war ! War ! Imagine what will happen . Pierre will have to go , and so will I go . I will not stay here under any circumstances .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FRANÇOIS</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Straightening himself , dropping the scissors .</l>
      <l>War ? What nonsense , my boy ! Who has entered Belgium ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>They — the Prussians . Pierre will go now , and I will go — I will not stay away under any circumstances , understand ? What will become of Belgium now ?— it is hard to conceive it . They entered Belgium yesterday — do you understand — what scoundrels ! In the distance , along the narrow streets of the town , an uneasy sound of footsteps and wheels is growing rapidly . Distinct voices and outcries blend into a dull , suppressed , ominous noise , full of alarm . The tolling , as though tired , now subsides , now turns almost to a shriek . François tries vainly to hear something . Then he takes up the scissors again angrily .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>François !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FRANÇOIS</speaker>
     <p>Sternly . That 's all nonsense ! What are you prating , my boy ? There is no war — that is impossible .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>You are a foolish old man , yourself ! They have entered</l>
      <l>Belgium — do you understand — they are here already .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FRANÇOIS</speaker>
     <p>That 's not true .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Why is n't it true ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FRANÇOIS</speaker>
     <p>Because that is impossible . The newspapers print nonsense , and they have all gone mad . Fools , and nothing more — madmen . What Prussians ? Young man , you have no right to make sport of me like this .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>But listen —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FRANÇOIS</speaker>
     <p>Prussians ! What Prussians ? I do n't know any Prussians , and I do n't want to know them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>But understand , old man , they are already bombarding Liège !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FRANÇOIS</speaker>
     <p>No !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>They have killed many people . What a strange man you are ! Do n't you hear the tolling of the bells ? The people are on the square . They are all running . The women are crying . What is that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FRANÇOIS</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Angrily .</l>
      <l>You are stepping on the flower bed . Get off !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Do n't bother me ! Why are they shouting so loudly ? Something has happened there . The sound of a trumpet is heard in the distance . The shouting of the crowd is growing ever louder . Sounds of the Belgian hymn are heard faintly . Suddenly an ominous silence follows the noise , and then the lone sound of the tolling bells .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Now they are quiet .... What does it mean ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FRANÇOIS</speaker>
     <p>Nonsense , nonsense !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Infuriated</speaker>
     <p>You are stepping on the flower bed again . Get off ! You have all lost your reason ! Go , go ! The Prussians !...</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>You have lost your reason !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FRANÇOIS</speaker>
     <p>I am seventy years old , and you tell me about the Prussians . Go ! Again the shouting of the crowd is heard . Silvina , the chambermaid , runs out of the house and calls : “ Monsieur Maurice ! ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SILVINA</speaker>
     <p>Please , come into the house . Madame Jeanne is calling you . Madame is going away . Please , come .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>And papa ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SILVINA</speaker>
     <p>He is n't here yet . Come ! Both move away . François sits down at the flower bed impatiently .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>You do n't understand , Silvina . He does not believe that there is a war .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SILVINA</speaker>
     <p>It is very dreadful , Monsieur Maurice . I am afraid — They go out . François looks after them angrily , adjusts his apron , and prepares to resume his work .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FRANÇOIS</speaker>
     <p>Madmen ! I am seventy years old . I am seventy years old , and they want me to believe a story about Prussians . Nonsense , they are crazy ! Prussians ! But it is true that I do n't hear anything . Rising , he listens attentively . No , not a sound . Or do I hear something ? Oh , the devil take it ! I can n't hear a sound . Impossible ! No , no , impossible ! But what is that ? How could I believe that in this calm sky — in this calm sky — The din of battle is growing . François listens again and hears it . He grows thoughtful . His eyes express fright . He looks as though he had suddenly solved a terrible problem . He moves to and fro , his head bent down , as though trying to catch the sounds . Suddenly he throws down the scissors . He is seized with a feeling of terror . He raises his hands . I hear it . No . No . Now I do n't hear a sound . Oh , God , give me the power to hear ! He tries again to catch the fleeting sounds , his head bent , his neck outstretched . His hair is disheveled . His eyes stare . Suddenly , by a great effort , he hears the tolling of the bells and voices full of despair . He retreats and raises his hands again . My God ! They are tolling ! They are crying ! War ! What war ? What war ? Eh , who is there — who is shouting “ War ! ” ? The sound of the bells and the cries grows louder . Emil Grelieu appears , walking quickly in the alley .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>What are you shouting , François ? Where is Maurice ? No one is in the house .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FRANÇOIS</speaker>
     <p>Is it war ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes , it is war . The Prussians have entered Belgium . But you do n't hear anything .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FRANÇOIS</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Painfully trying to catch the sounds .</l>
      <l>I hear , I hear ; are they killing ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Yes , they are killing . The Prussians have entered Belgium . Where is Maurice ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FRANÇOIS</speaker>
     <p>But , Monsieur Emil — but , Monsieur , what Prussians ? Pardon me ; I am seventy years old , and I lost my sense of hearing long ago .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Weeps</speaker>
     <p>Is it really a war ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Yes , it is a real war . I can n't understand it either . But the fighting has already commenced . I can n't realize it myself , but it is war , old man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FRANÇOIS</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Tell me , Monsieur . Tell me about it . I believe you as I believe</l>
      <l>God . Tell me . I can hear you . Are they killing ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>It is war ! What horror , François . It is very hard to understand it — yes , very hard . Frowns and rubs his high , pale forehead nervously .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>FRANÇOIS</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Bent , weeps , his head shaking .</l>
      <l>And the flowers ? Our flowers ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Absentmindedly . Our flowers ? Do n't cry , François — ah , what is that ? The tolling of the bells subsides . The crying and the shouting of the crowd changes , into a harmonious volume of sound — somebody is hailed in the distance . An important announcement seems to have been made there .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Absentmindedly . Our people are expecting the King there — he is on his way to Liège ! Yes , yes — Silence . Suddenly there is a sound like the crash of thunder . Then it changes into a song — the crowd is singing the Belgian hymn .</p>

     <stage>In the room are Emil Grelieu and his elder son , Pierre , a handsome , pale , and frail-looking young man . He is dressed in military uniform . They pace up and down the room slowly .

     <p>Seventy-four or five —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>Seventy-five — yes , about a hundred kilometers . It 's not far , father .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Not far . It seemed to me that I heard cannonading . I heard it last night .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>No , it 's hardly possible .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I was mistaken . But the rays of the searchlights could be seen . They must be very powerful searchlights . Mamma saw them too .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>Really ? You are suffering from insomnia again , father ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I sleep well . A hundred kilometers — a hundred kilometers —</l>
      <l>Silence . Pierre looks at his father attentively .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>Father !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Well ? It 's too early for you , Pierre — you have three hours yet before your train starts . I am watching the time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>I know , father . No , I am thinking of something else —. Father , tell me , have you still any hopes ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Silence</speaker>
     <p>I am hesitating , I feel somewhat embarrassed to speak to you — you are so much wiser , so far above me , father .... Yes , yes , it 's nonsense , of course , but that which I have learned in the army during these days gives me very little hope . They are coming in such a compact mass of people , of iron , machines , arms and horses , that there is no possibility of stopping them . It seems to me that seismographs must indicate the place over which they pass — they press the ground with such force . And we are so few in number !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Yes , we are very few in number .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>Very , very few , father ! Dreadfully few ! Even if we were invulnerable and deathless , even if we kept killing them off day and night , day and night , we would drop from fatigue and exhaustion before we stopped them . But we are mortal — and they have terrible guns , father ! You are silent ? You are thinking of our Maurice — I have caused you pain ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>There is little of the human in their movements . Do not think of Maurice — he will live . A human being has a face , Pierre . Every human being has his own face , but they have no faces . When I try to picture them to myself , I see only the lights , projectors , automobiles — those terrible guns — and something walking , walking . And those vulgar mustaches of Wilhelm — but that is a mask , an immobile mask , which has stood over Europe for a quarter of a century — what is behind it ? Those vulgar mustaches — and suddenly so much misery , so much bloodshed and destruction ! It is a mask !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>Almost to himself . If there were only not so many of them , not so many —. Father , I believe that Maurice will live . He is a lucky boy . But what does mamma think about it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>What mamma thinks ? Enter François . Sternly , without looking at anyone , he waters the flowers . And what does he think ? Look at him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>He can hardly hear anything . François !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>I do n't know whether he hears anything or not . But there was a time when he did hear . He is silent , Pierre , and he furiously denies war . He denies it by work — he works alone in the garden as if nothing had happened . Our house is full of refugees . Mamma and everyone else in the house are busy , feeding them , washing the children — mamma is washing them — but he does not seem to notice anything . He denies war ! Now he is bursting from anxiety to hear or guess what we are saying , but do you see the expression of his face ? If you start to talk to him he will go away .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>François !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Do n't bother him . He wants to be crafty . Perhaps he hears us . You ask me what mother is thinking of . Do I know ? Who can tell ? You see that she is not here , and yet these are your last hours at home . Yes , in this house — I am speaking of the house . She is young and resolute as ever , she walks just as lightly and is just as clear-headed , but she is not here . She is simply not here , Pierre .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>Is she concealing something ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>No , she is not concealing anything , but she has gone into the depths of her own self , where all is silence and mystery . She is living through her motherhood again , from the very beginning — do you understand ? when you and Maurice were not yet born — but in this she is crafty , like François . Sometimes I see clearly that she is suffering unbearably , that she is terrified by the war —. But she smiles in answer and then I see something else — I see how there has suddenly awakened in her the prehistoric woman — the woman who handed her husband the fighting club —. Wait , the soldiers are coming again ! Military music is heard in the distance , nearing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , according to the assignment , it is the Ninth Regiment .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Let us hear it , Pierre . I hear this music several times a day . There it starts on the right , and there it dies down . Always there .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>They listen</speaker>
     <p>But they are brave fellows !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>Yes . Both listen attentively at the window . François looks at them askance and tries in vain to hear . The music begins to die out .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Walking away from the window . Yesterday they played the “ Marseillaise . ” But they are brave fellows ! Emil Grelieu 's wife enters quickly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Do you hear it ? How beautiful ! Even our refugees smiled when they heard it . Emil , I have brought you some telegrams , here . I have read them .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>What is it ? Let me have them ! Reading the telegrams , he staggers to an armchair and sinks into it . He turns pale .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>What is it , father ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Read ! Pierre reads it over the shoulder of his father . The woman looks at them with an enigmatical expression upon her face . She sits calmly , her beautiful head thrown back . Emil Grelieu rises quickly , and both he and his son start to pace the room in opposite directions .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>Do you see ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>Do you see ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Yes ! Yes !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>As though indifferently .</l>
      <l>Emil , was that an interesting library which they have destroyed ?</l>
      <l>I do n't know .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Yes , very . But what are you asking me , Jeanne ? How can you speak ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I speak only of those books ! Tell me , were there many books there ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Yes , many , many !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>And they 've burned them ?</l>
      <l>She hums softly in afresh , strong voice .</l>
      <l>“ Only the halo of the arts crowns law , liberty , and the</l>
      <l>King !— Law — ”</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Books , books .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>And there was also a Cathedral there . Oh , I remember it ! Is n't it true , Emil , that it was a beautiful structure ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Hums</speaker>
     <p>“ Law , liberty , and the King — ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>Father !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>What ?</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>EMIL GRELIEU</l>
      <l>He walks up and down the room .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Pierre , it will soon be time for you to leave . I 'll give you something to eat at once . Pierre , do you think it is true that they are killing women and children ? I do n't know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>It is true , mother .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>How can you say it , Jeanne ? You do n't know ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>I say this on account of the children . Yes , there they write that they are killing children , so they write there . And all this was crowded upon that little slip of paper — and the children , as well as the fire — Rises quickly and walks away , humming .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Where are you going , Jeanne ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Nowhere in particular . François , do you hear ? They are murdering our women and children . François ! François ! Without turning around , François walks out , his shoulders bent . All look after him . Jeanne goes to the other door with a strange half-smile .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>Mamma !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>I will return directly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>What shall I call them ? What can I call them ? My dear Pierre , my boy , what shall I call them ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>You are greatly agitated , father .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>I have always thought , I have always been convinced that words were at my command , but here I stand before this monstrous , inexplicable — I do n't know , I do n't know what to call them . My heart is crying out , I hear its voice , but the word ! Pierre , you are a student , you are young , your words are direct and pure — Pierre , find the word !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>You want me to find it , father ? Yes , I was a student , and I knew certain words : Peace , Right , Humanity . But now you see ! My heart is crying too , but I do not know what to call these scoundrels . Scoundrels ? That is not sufficient .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>In despair</speaker>
     <p>Not sufficient .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>That is not strong enough . Pierre , I have decided —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>Decided ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I am going .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>You , father ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>I decided to do it several days ago — even then , at the very beginning . And I really do n't know why I —. Oh , yes , I had to overcome within me — my love for flowers .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Ironically</speaker>
     <p>Yes , Pierre , my love for flowers . Oh , my boy , it is so hard to change from flowers to iron and blood !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>Father , I dare not contradict you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>No , no , you dare not . It is not necessary . Listen , Pierre , you must examine me as a physician .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>I am only a student , father .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Yes , but you know enough to say —. You see , Pierre , I must not burden our little army with a single superfluous sick or weak man . Is n't that so ? I must bring with me strength and power , not shattered health . Is n't that so ? And I am asking you , Pierre , to examine me , simply as a physician , as a young physician . But I feel somewhat embarrassed with you —. Must I take this off , or can you do it without removing this ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>It can be done this way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>I think so , too . And — must I tell you everything , or —? At any rate , I will tell you that I have not had any serious ailments , and for my years I am a rather strong , healthy man . You know what a life I am leading .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>That is unnecessary , father .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>It is necessary . You are a physician . I want to say that in my life there were none of those unwholesome — and bad excesses . Oh , the devil take it , how hard it is to speak of it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>Papa , I know all this . Quickly kisses his father 's hand . Silence .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>But it is necessary to take my pulse , Pierre , I beg of you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>Smiling faintly . It is n't necessary to do even that . As a physician , I can tell you that you are healthy , but — you are unfit for war , you are unfit for war , father ! I am listening to you and I feel like crying , father .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Thoughtfully .</l>
      <l>Yes , yes . But perhaps it is not necessary to cry . Do you think ,</l>
      <l>Pierre , that I should not kill ? Pierre , you think , that I , Emil</l>
      <l>Grelieu , must not kill under any circumstances and at any time ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Softly .</l>
      <l>I dare not touch upon your conscience , father .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Yes , that is a terrible question for a man . I must kill , Pierre . Of course , I could take your gun , but not to fire — no , that would have been disgusting , a sacrilegious deception ! When my humble people are condemned to kill , who am I that I should keep my hands clean ? That would be disgusting cleanliness , obnoxious saintliness . My humble nation did not desire to kill , but it was forced , and it has become a murderer . So I , too , must become a murderer , together with my nation . Upon whose shoulders will I place the sin — upon the shoulders of our youths and children ? No , Pierre . And if ever the Higher Conscience of the world will call my dear people to the terrible accounting , if it will call you and Maurice , my children , and will say to you : “ What have you done ? You have murdered ! ” I will come forward and will say : “ First you must judge me ; I have also murdered — and you know that I am an honest man ! ” Pierre sits motionless , his face covered with his hands . Enter Jeanne , unnoticed .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Uncovering his face .</l>
      <l>But you must not die ! You have no right !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Loudly , and with contempt .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Oh , death !</speaker>
     <p>They notice Jeanne , and grow silent . Jeanne sits down and speaks in the same tone of strange , almost cheerful calm .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Emil , she is here again .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Yes ? She is here again . Where has she been the last two nights ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>She does not know herself . Emil , her dress and her hands were in blood .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>She is wounded ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>No , it is not her own blood , and by the color I could not tell whose blood it is .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>Who is that , mother ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>A girl . Just a girl . She 's insane . I have combed her hair and put a clean dress on her . She has beautiful hair . Emil , I have heard something — I understand that you want to go —?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Together with your children , Emil ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Yes . Pierre has examined me and finds that I am fit to enter the ranks .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>You intend to go tomorrow ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>You cannot manage it today . Pierre , you have only an hour and a half left .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Silence</speaker>
     <p>PIERRE Mamma ! Tell him that he must not — Forgive me , father !— that he should not go . Is n't that true , mother ? Tell him ! He has given to the nation his two sons — what more should he give ? He has no right to give more .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>More , Pierre ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>Yes ,— his life . You love him ; you , yourself , would die if he were killed — tell him that , mother !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I love him . I love you , too .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , what are we , Maurice and I ? But he ! Just as they have no right to destroy temples in war or to bum libraries , just as they have no right to touch the eternal , so he — he — has no right to die . I am speaking not as your son , no ; but to kill Emil Grelieu — that would be worse than to bum books . Listen to me ! You have brought me into this world . Listen to me !— although I am young and should be silent — Listen to me ! They have already robbed us . They have deprived us of our land and of the air ; they have destroyed our treasures which have been created by the genius of our people , and now we would cast our best men into their jaws ! What does that mean ? What will remain of us ? Let them kill us all , let our land be turned into a waste desert , let all living creatures be burned to death , but as long as he lives , Belgium is alive ! What is Belgium without him ? Oh , do not be silent , mother ! Tell him !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Silence</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>EMIL GRELIEU</l>
      <l>Somewhat sternly .</l>
      <l>Calm yourself , Pierre !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Yesterday I — no , Pierre , that is n't what I was going to say — I do n't know anything about it . How could I know ? But yesterday I — it is hard to get vegetables , and even bread , here — so I went to town , and for some reason we did not go in that direction , but nearer the field of battle —. How strange it is that we found ourselves there ! And there I saw them coming —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Whom ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Our soldiers . They were coming from there — where the battle raged for four days . There were not many of them — about a hundred or two hundred . But we all — there were so many people in the streets — we all stepped back to the wall in order to make way for them . Emil , just think of it ; how strange ! They did not see us , and we would have been in their way ! They were black from smoke , from mud , from dried blood , and they were swaying from fatigue . They were all thin — as consumptives . But that is nothing , that is all nothing . Their eyes — what was it , Emil ? They did not see their surroundings , they still reflected that which they had seen there — fire and smoke and death — and what else ? Some one said : “ Here are people returning from hell . ” We all bowed to them , we bowed to them , but they did not see that either . Is that possible , Emil ?</p>

     <p>Yes , Jeanne , that is possible .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>And he will go to that inferno ? Silence . Emil Grelieu walks over to his wife and kisses her hand . She looks at his head with a smile . Suddenly she rises .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Forgive me ; there is something else I must say — She moves quickly and lightly , but suddenly , as though stumbling over an invisible obstacle , falls on one knee . Then she tries to rise , kneels , pale and still smiling , bending to one side . They rush over to her and lift her from the ground .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>Mamma ! Mamma !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>You have a headache ? Jeanne , my dearest , what ails you ? She pushes them aside , stands up firmly , trying to conceal her nervousness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>What is it ? What ? Do n't trouble , Emil ! My head ? No , no ! My foot slipped — you know , the one that pained me . You see , I can walk now .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>A glass of water , Pierre .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>What for ? How absurd ! But Pierre had already gone out . Jeanne sits down , hangs her head , as one guilty , endeavoring not to look into his eyes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>What an excitable youth — your Pierre ! Did you hear what he said ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Significantly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Jeanne !</speaker>
     <p>JEANNE What ? No , no — why do you look at me this way ? No — I am telling you . Pierre brings her water , but Jeanne does not drink it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Thank you , Pierre , but I do n't want it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Silence</speaker>
     <p>How fragrant the flowers are . Pierre , please give me that rose — yes , that one . Thank you . How fresh it is , Emil , and what a fine fragrance — come over here , Emil ! Emil Grelieu goes over to her and kisses the hand in which she holds the rose . Looks at her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Lowering her hand . No ; I have asked for this flower simply because its fragrance seems to me immortal — it is always the same — as the sky . How strange it is , always the same . And when you bring it close to your face , and close to your eyes , it seems to you that there is nothing except this red rose and the blue sky . Nothing but the red rose and the distant , pale — very pale — blue sky ....</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Pierre ! Listen to me , my boy ! People speak of this only at night , when they are alone with their souls — and she knows it , but you do not know it yet . Do n't you know it , Jeanne ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Trembling , opening her eyes .</l>
      <l>Yes , I know , Emil .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>The life of the poet does not belong to him . The roof over the heads of people , which shelters them — all that is a phantom for me , and my life does not belong to me . I am always far away , not here — I am always where I am not . You think of finding me among the living , while I am dead ; you are afraid of finding me in death , mute , cold , doomed to decay , while I live and sing aloud from my grave . Death which makes people mute , which leaves the imprint of silence upon the bravest lips , restores the voice to the poet . Dead , I speak more loudly than alive . Dead , I am alive ! Am I — just think of it , Pierre , my boy ,— am I to fear death when in my most persistent searches I could not find the boundary between life and death , when in my feelings I mix life and death into one — as two strong , rare kinds of wine ? Just think of it , my boy ! Silence . Emil Grelieu looks at his son , smiling . Pierre has covered his face with his hands . The woman is apparently calm . She turns her eyes from her weeping son to her husband .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Uncovering his face .</l>
      <l>Forgive me , father !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Take this rose , Pierre , and when it fades and falls apart tear down another rose — it will have the same fragrance as this one . You are a foolish little boy , Pierre , but I am also foolish , although Emil is so kind that he thinks differently . Will you be in the same regiment , Emil ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>No , hardly , Jeanne .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <p>Father , it is better that we be in the same regiment . I will arrange it , father — will you permit me ? And I will teach you how to march —. You know , I am going to be your superior officer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Smiling .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Very well</speaker>
     <p>JEANNE Goes out singing in a low voice . “ Only the halo of the arts is crowning — law , liberty , and the King . ” Who is that ? Ah , you ! Look , Pierre , here is the girl you wished to see . Come in , come in , my dear child ! Do n't be afraid , come in ! You know him . That 's my husband . He is a very good man and will do you no harm . And this is my son , Pierre . Give him your hand . A girl enters ; she is frail , very pale , and beautiful . She wears a black dress , her hair is combed neatly , and she is modest in her demeanor . Her eyes reflect fright and sorrow . She is followed by the chambermaid , Silvina , a kind , elderly woman in a white cap ; by Madame Henrietta , and another woman in the service of the Grelieu household . They stop at the threshold and watch the girl curiously . The elder woman is weeping as she looks at her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GIRL</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Stretching forth her hand to Pierre .</l>
      <l>Oh , that is a soldier ! Be so kind , soldier , tell me how to go to</l>
      <l>Lonua . I have lost my way .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Confused .</l>
      <l>I do not know , Mademoiselle .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GIRL</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Looking at everybody mournfully .</l>
      <l>Who knows ? It is time for me to go .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Cautiously and tenderly leading her to a seat . Sit down , child , take a rest , my dear , give your poor feet a rest . Pierre , her feet are wounded , yet she wants to walk all the time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ELDERLY WOMAN</speaker>
     <p>I wanted to stop her , Monsieur Pierre , but it is impossible to stop her . If we close the door before her the poor girl beats her head against the walls , like a bird in a cage . Poor girl ! Dries her tears . François enters from the garden and occupies himself again with the flowers . He glances at the girl from time to time . It is evident that he is making painful efforts to hear and understand what is going on .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GIRL</speaker>
     <p>It is time for me to go .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Rest yourself , here , my child ! Why should you leave ? At night it is so terrible on the roads . There , in the dark air , bullets are buzzing instead of our dear bees ; there wicked people , vicious beasts are roaming . And there is no one who can tell you , for there is no one who knows how to go to Lonua .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GIRL</speaker>
     <p>Do n't you know how I could find my way to Lonua ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PIERRE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Softly .</l>
      <l>What is she asking ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Emil GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Oh , you may speak louder ; she can hear as little as François . She is asking about the village which the Prussians have set on fire . Her home used to be there — now there are only ruins and corpses there . There is no road that leads to Lonua !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GIRL</speaker>
     <p>Do n't you know it , either ? No one knows . I have asked everybody , and no one can tell me how to find my way to Lonua . I must hurry . They are waiting for me there . She rises quickly and walks over to François . Tell me ; you are kindhearted ! Do n't you know the way to Lonua ? François looks at her intently . Silently he turns away and walks out , stooping .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Seating her again .</l>
      <l>Sit down , little girl . He does not know .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GIRL</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Sadly .</l>
      <l>I am asking , and they are silent .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>I suppose she is also asking the bodies of the dead that lie in the fields and in the ditches how to go to Lonua .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Her hands and her dress were bloodstained . She was walking all night . Take a rest , my little one ! I will hold you in my arms , and you will feel better and more comfortable , my little child .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GIRL</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Softly .</l>
      <l>Tell me , how can I find my way to Lonua ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , yes , come ! Emil , I will go with her to my room . There she will feel more comfortable . Come along , my dear . I 'll hold you . Come ! They go out . The other women follow them . Emil Grelieu and Pierre remain .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Lonua ! A quiet little village which no one ever noticed before — houses , trees , and flowers . Where is it now ? Who knows the way to that little village ? Pierre , the soul of our people is roaming about in the watches of the night , asking the dead how to find the way to Lonua ! Pierre , I cannot endure it any longer ! I am suffocating from hatred and anger ! Oh , weep , you German Nation — bitter will be the fate of your children , terrible will be your disgrace before the judgment of the free nations !</p>

     <stage>Night . The dark silhouette of Emil Grelieu 's villa stands out in the background . The gatekeeper 's house is seen among the trees , a dim light in the window . At the cast-iron fence frightened women are huddled together , watching the fire in the distance . An alarming redness has covered the sky ; only in the zenith is the sky dark . The reflection of the fire falls upon objects and people , casting strange shadows against the mirrors of the mute and dark villa . The voices sound muffled and timid ; there are frequent pauses and prolonged sighs . Three women .</stage>

     <p>SECOND WOMAN I can n't hear a sound . What is binning there ? If I close my eyes it seems to me that nothing is going on there . It is so quiet ! Even the dogs are not barking !</p>

     <p>Good evening , Madame Henrietta ! Never mind my coming here — it is terrible to stay in the house ! I guessed that you were not sleeping , but here , watching . You can see well from this spot . Do n't you know where the fire is ?</p>

     <p>Maybe . Everybody is talking about it , but we do n't know . He disappeared quietly , like a mouse .</p>

     <p>Wait , wait ! Today , while I was in the garden , I heard the telephone ringing in the house ; it was ringing for a long time . I was frightened , but I went in after all — and , just think of it ! Some one said : “ Monsieur Pierre was killed ! ”</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>SECOND WOMAN</speaker>
     <p>Before this , when my soul wanted rest and joy I looked at the sky , but now there is no place where a poor soul can find rest and joy !</p>

     <speaker>FOURTH WOMAN</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>They have taken everything away from our Belgium — even the sky !</l>

     <p>It is still early . Perhaps you will try to fall asleep , Emil ? It seems to me that you have been suffering great pain ; you have been groaning all night .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>No , I am feeling better . How is the weather this morning ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Nasty weather , Emil ; you can n't see the sun . Try to sleep . Silence . Suddenly Maurice utters a cry in his sleep ; the cry turns into a groan and indistinct mumbling . Jeanne walks over to him and listens , then returns to her seat .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Is the boy getting on well ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Do n't worry , Emil . He only said a few words in his sleep .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>He has done it several times tonight .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>I am afraid that he is disturbing you . We can have him removed to another room and Henrietta will stay with him . The boy 's blood is in good condition . In another week , I believe , we shall be able to remove the bandage from his arm .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>No , let him stay here , Jeanne .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>What is it , my dear ? She kneels at his bed and kisses his hand carefully .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Jeanne !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>I think your fever has gone down , my dear . Impresses another kiss upon his hand and clings to it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>You are my love , Jeanne .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Do not speak , do not speak . Do n't agitate yourself . A brief moment of silence .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Moving his head restlessly .</l>
      <l>It is so hard to breathe here , the air ——</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>The window has been open all night , my dear . There is not a breeze outside .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>There is smoke .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Utters a cry once more , then mutters — Stop , stop , stop ! Again indistinctly . It is burning , it is burning ! Oh ! Who is going to the battery , who is going to the battery —— He mutters and then grows silent .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>What painful dreams !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>That 's nothing ; the boy always used to talk in his sleep . Yesterday he looked so well .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Jeanne !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>What is it , my dear ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Sit down .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Very well .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Jeanne .... Are you thinking about Pierre ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Silence</speaker>
     <p>JEANNE</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Softly</speaker>
     <p>Do n't speak of him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>You are right . Death is not so terrible . Is n't that true , Jeanne ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>After a brief pause .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>That 's true</speaker>
     <p>EMIL GRELIEU We shall follow him later . He will not come here , but we shall go to him . I was thinking of it at night . It is so clear . Do you remember the red rose which you gave him ? I remember it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>It is so clear . Jeanne , lean over me . You are the best woman in the world .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Silence</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>EMIL GRELIEU</l>
      <l>Tossing about in his bed .</l>
      <l>It is so hard to breathe .</l>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>My dear ——</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>No , that 's nothing . The night is tormenting me . Jeanne , was I dreaming , or have I really heard cannonading ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>You really heard it , at about five o'clock . But very far away , Emil — it was hardly audible . Close your eyes , my dear , rest yourself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Silence</speaker>
     <p>MAURICE</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Faintly</speaker>
     <p>Mamma ! Jeanne walks over to him quietly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Are you awake ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Yes . I have slept enough . How is father ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>He is awake .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Good morning , Maurice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Good morning , papa . How do you feel ? I am feeling well .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>I , too , am feeling well . Jeanne , you may draw the curtain aside . I can n't sleep any longer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Very well . What a nasty day ! Still it will be easier for you to breathe when it is light . She draws the curtain aside slowly , so as not to make it too light at once . Beyond the large window vague silhouettes of the trees are seen at the window frames and several withered , bent flowers . Maurice is trying to adjust the screen .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>What are you doing , Maurice ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>My coat — Never mind , I 'll fix it myself .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Guiltily</speaker>
     <p>No , mamma , you had better help me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Going behind the screen .</l>
      <l>What a foolish boy you are , Maurice .</l>
      <l>Behind the screen .</l>
      <l>Be careful , be careful , that 's the way . Do n't hurry , be careful .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Behind the screen . Pin this for me right here , as you did yesterday . That 's very good .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Behind the screen . Of course . Wait , you 'll kiss me later —. Well ? That 's the way . Maurice comes out , his right arm dressed in a bandage . He goes over to his father and first kisses his hand , then , upon a sign from his eyes , he kisses him on the lips .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Good morning , good morning , my dear boy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Looking around at the screen , where his mother is putting the bed in order .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Papa , look !</speaker>
     <p>He takes his hand out of the bandage and straightens it quickly . Then he puts it back just as quickly . Emil Grelieu threatens him with his finger . Jeanne puts the screen aside , and the bed is already in order .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>I am through now . Maurice , come to the bathroom . I 'll wash you .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , no ; under no circumstances . I 'll wash myself today . Last night I washed myself with my left hand and it was very fine . Walking over to the open window . How nasty it is . These scoundrels have spoiled the day . Still , it is warm and there is the smell of flowers . It 's good , papa ; it is very fine .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Yes , it is pleasant .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Well , I am going .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Clean your teeth ; you did n't do it yesterday , Maurice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Grumbling .</l>
      <l>What 's the use of it now ? Very well , I 'll do it .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>At the door</speaker>
     <p>Papa , do you know , well have good news today ; I feel it . He is heard calling in a ringing voice , “ Silvina . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>I feel better .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>I 'll let you have your coffee directly . You are looking much better today , much better .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>What is this ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Perfume , with water . I 'll bathe your face with it That 's the way . Now I again have little children to wash. You see how pleasant it feels .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Yes . What did he say about good news ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>He did n't mean anything . He is very happy because he is a hero .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Do you know any news ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Irresolutely .</l>
      <l>Nothing . What news could there be ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Tell me , Jeanne ; you were firmer before . Tell me my dear .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Was I firmer ? Perhaps .... I have grown accustomed to talk to you softly at night . Well — how shall I tell it to you ? They are coming .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Coming ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Yes . You know their numbers and ours . Do n't be excited , but I think that it will be necessary for us to leave for Antwerp today .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Are they near ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , they are near . Very near .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Sings softly</speaker>
     <p>“ Le Roi , la Loi , la Liberté . ” Very near . I have not told you that the King inquired yesterday about your health . I answered that you were feeling better and that you will be able to leave today .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Of course I am able to leave today . And what did he say about them ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>What did the King say ?</l>
      <l>Singing the same tune .</l>
      <l>He said that their numbers were too great .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>What else did he say ? What else , Jeanne ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>What else ? He said that there was a God and there was righteousness . That 's what I believe I heard him say — that there was still a God and that righteousness was still in existence . How old these words are , Emil ! But it is so good that they still exist .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Silence</speaker>
     <p>EMIL GRELIEU Yes , in the daytime you are so different . Where do you get so much strength , Jeanne ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Where ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>I am forever looking at your hair . I am wondering why it has n't turned gray .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>I dye it at night , Emil . I 'll bring in some more flowers . Now it is very cozy here . Oh , yes , I have n't told you yet — some one will be here to see you today — Secretary Lagard and some one else by the name of Count Clairmont .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Count Clairmont ? I do n't know him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>It is not necessary that you should know him . He is simply known as Count Clairmont , Count Clairmont —. That 's a good name for a very good man .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>I know a very good man in Belgium —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Tsh ! You must not know anything . You must only remember — Count</l>
      <l>Clairmont . They have some important matters to discuss with you ,</l>
      <l>I believe . And they 'll send you an automobile , to take you to</l>
      <l>Antwerp .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>

      <l>Count Clairmont ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Also smiling . Yes . You are loved by everybody , but if I were a King , I would have sent you an aeroplane . Throwing back her hands in sorrow which she is trying vainly to suppress . Ah , how good it would be now to rise from the ground and fly — and fly for a long , long time .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Enter Maurice .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>I am ready now , I have cleaned my teeth . I 've even taken a walk in the garden . But I have never before noticed that we have such a beautiful garden ! Papa , our garden is wonderfully beautiful !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Coffee will be ready directly . If he disturbs you with his talk , call me , Emil .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I did not mean to disturb you . Forgive me , papa . I 'll not disturb you any more .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>You may speak , speak . I am feeling quite well , quite well .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>But you must save your strength , do n't forget that , Emil .</p>
    </sp>
    <stage>Exit .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Sitting down quietly at the window .</l>
      <l>Perhaps I really ought not to speak , papa ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Smiling faintly .</l>
      <l>Can you be silent ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Blushing . No , father , I cannot just now . I suppose I seem to you very young .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>And what do you think of it yourself ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Blushing again . I am no longer as young as I was three weeks ago . Yes , only three weeks ago — I remember the tolling of the bells in our church , I remember how I teased François . How strange that François has been lost and no one knows where he is . What does it mean that a human being is lost and no one knows where he is ? Before , one could see everything on earth .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Papa ! Why do they hang such people as François ? That is cruel and stupid . Forgive me for speaking so harshly . But need an old man love his fatherland less than I love it , for instance ? The old people love it even more intensely . Let everyone fight as he can . I am not tiring you , am I ? An old man came to us , he was very feeble , he asked for bullets — well , let them hang me too — I gave him bullets . A few of our regiment made sport of him , but he said : “ If only one Prussian bullet will strike me , it means that the Prussians will have one bullet less . ” That appealed to me .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Yes , that appeals to me , too . Have you heard the cannonading at dawn ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>No . Why , was there any cannonading ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Yes . I heard cannonading . Did mamma tell you that they are coming nearer and nearer ? They are approaching .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Rising .</l>
      <l>Really ? Impossible !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>They are coming , and we must leave for Antwerp today .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Yes . He rises and walks back and forth , forgetting his wounded arm . He is greatly agitated . Clenches his fist .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Father , tell me : What do you think of the present state of affairs ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Mamma says there is a God and there is righteousness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Raising his hand . Mamma says —— Let God bless mamma ! I do n't know — I —. Very well , very well . We shall see ; we shall see ! His face twitches like a child 's face . He is trying to repress his tears .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>I still owe them something for Pierre . Forgive me , father ; I do n't know whether I have a right to say this or not , but I am altogether different from you . It is wicked but I can n't help it . I was looking this morning at your flowers in the garden and I felt so sorry — sorry for you , because you had grown them . Those rascals !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Maurice !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>The scoundrels ! I do n't want to consider them human beings , and</l>
      <l>I shall not consider them human beings .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <stage>Enter Jeanne .</stage>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>What is it , Maurice ? That is n't right .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Very well . As he passes he embraces his mother with his left hand and kisses her .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>You had better sit down . It is dangerous for your health to walk around this way .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Sit down , Maurice . Maurice sits down at the window facing the garden . Emil Grelieu smiles sadly and closes his eyes . Silvina , the maid , brings in coffee and sets it on the table near Grelieu 's bed .</p>

     <p>Good morning , Monsieur Emil .</p>

      <l>Opening his eyes .</l>
      <l>Good morning , Silvina .</l>

     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Go and have your breakfast , Maurice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Without turning around . I do n't want any breakfast . Mamma , I 'll take off my bandage tomorrow .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Laughing .</l>
      <l>Soldier , is it possible that you are capricious ?</l>
      <l>Silence . Jeanne helps Emil Grelieu with his coffee .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>That 's the way . Is it convenient for you this way , or do you want to drink it with a spoon ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Oh , my poor head , it is so weak —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Going over to him . Forgive me , father , I 'll not do it any more . I was foolishly excited , but do you know I could not endure it . May I have a cup , mamma ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , this is yours . You feel better now ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I do .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>I am feeling perfectly well today , Jeanne . When is the bandage to be changed ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Later . Count Clairmont will bring his surgeon along with him .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Who is that , mamma ? Have I seen him ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>You 'll see him . But , please , Maurice , when you see him , do n't open your mouth so wide . You have a habit — you open your mouth and then you forget about it .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Blushing . You are both looking at me and smiling . But I have time yet to grow . I have time yet to grow . The sound of automobiles is heard .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Rising quickly . I think they are here . Maurice , this is only Count Clairmont , do n't forget . I 'll be back directly . They will speak with you about a very , very important matter , Emil , but you must not be agitated .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Yes , I know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Kissing him quickly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>I am going</speaker>
     <p>Exit , almost colliding with Silvina , who is excited .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Whispering . Who is it , Silvina ? Silvina makes some answer in mingled delight and awe . Maurice 's face assumes the same expression as Silvina 's . Silvina goes out . Maurice walks quickly to the window and raises his left hand to his forehead , straightening himself in military fashion . Thus he stands until the others notice him . Enter Jeanne , Count Clairmont , followed by Secretary Lagard and the Count 's adjudant , an elderly General of stem appearance , with numerous decorations upon his chest . The Count himself is tall , well built and young , in a modest officer 's uniform , without any medals to signify his high station . He carries himself very modestly , almost bashfully , but overcoming his first uneasiness , he speaks warmly and powerfully and freely . His gestures are swift . All treat him with profound respect . Lagard is a strong old man with a leonine gray head . He speaks simply , his gestures are calm and resolute . It is evident that he is in the habit of speaking from a platform . Jeanne holds a large bouquet of flowers in her hands . Count Clairmont walks directly toward Grelieu 's bedside . COUNT CLAIRMONT</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Confused</speaker>
     <p>I have come to shake hands with you , my dear master . Oh , but do not make a single unnecessary movement , not a single one , otherwise I shall be very unhappy !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>I am deeply moved , I am happy . COUNT CLAIRMONT No , no , do n't speak that way . Here stands before you only a man who has learned to think from your books . But see what they have done to you — look , Lagard !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LAGARD</speaker>
     <p>How are you , Grelieu ? I , too , want to shake your hand . Today I am a Secretary by the will of Fate , but yesterday I was only a physician , and I may congratulate you — you have a kind hand . Let me feel your pulse .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GENERAL</speaker>
     <p>Coming forward modestly . Allow me , too , in the name of this entire army of ours to express to you our admiration , Monsieur Grelieu !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>I thank you . I am feeling perfectly well , Lagard .</l>
      <l>COUNT CLAIRMONT</l>
      <l>But perhaps it is necessary to have a surgeon ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>He can listen and talk , Count . He is smiling — he can listen .</l>
      <l>COUNT CLAIRMONT</l>
      <l>Noticing Maurice , confused .</l>
      <l>Oh ! who is this ? Please put down your hand — you are wounded .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>I am so happy , Count .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>This is our second son . Our first son , Pierre , was killed at</l>
      <l>Liège —</l>
      <l>COUNT CLAIRMONT</l>
      <l>I dare not console you , Madame Grelieu . Give me your hand ,</l>
      <l>Maurice .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , Count ! I am only a soldier . I dare not — COUNT CLAIRMONT My dear young man , I , too , am nothing but a soldier now . Your hand , comrade . That 's the way . Master ! My children and my wife have sent you flowers — but where are they ? Oh ! how absentminded I am .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Here they are , Count . COUNT CLAIRMONT Thank you . But I did not know that your flowers were better than mine , for my flowers smell of smoke .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LAGARD</speaker>
     <p>Like all Belgium . To Count Clairmont . His pulse is good . Grelieu , we have come to you not only to express our sympathy . Through me all the working people of Belgium are shaking your hand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>I am proud of it , Lagard .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LAGARD</speaker>
     <p>But we are just as proud . Yes ; there is something we must discuss with you . Count Clairmont did not wish to disturb you , but I said : “ Let him die , but before that we must speak to him . ” Is n't that so , comrade ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>I am not dying . Maurice , I think you had better go out . COUNT CLAIRMONT</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Quickly</speaker>
     <p>Oh , no , no . He is your son , Grelieu , and he should be present to hear what his father will say . Oh , I should have been proud to have such a father .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LAGARD</speaker>
     <p>Our Count is a very fine young man — Pardon me , Count , I have again upset our — COUNT CLAIRMONT That 's nothing , I have already grown accustomed to it . Master , it is necessary for you and your family to leave for Antwerp today .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Are our affairs in such a critical condition ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LAGARD</speaker>
     <p>What is there to tell ? Things are in bad shape , very bad . That horde of Huns is coming upon us like the tide of the sea . Today they are still there , but tomorrow they will flood your house , Grelieu . They are coming toward Antwerp . To what can we resort in our defence ? On this side are they , and there is the sea . Only very little is left of Belgium , Grelieu . Very soon there will be no room even for my beard here . Is n't that so , Count ? Silence . Dull sounds of cannonading are heard in the distance . All turn their eyes to the window .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Is that a battle ? COUNT CLAIRMONT Listening , calmly . No , that is only the beginning . But tomorrow they will carry their devilish weapons past your house . Do you know they are real iron monsters , under whose weight our earth is quaking and groaning . They are moving slowly , like amphibia that have crawled out at night from the abyss — but they are moving ! Another few days will pass , and they will crawl over to Antwerp , they will turn their jaws to the city , to the churches — Woe to Belgium , master ! Woe to Belgium !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LAGARD</speaker>
     <p>Yes , it is very bad . We are an honest and peaceful people despising bloodshed , for war is such a stupid affair ! And we should not have had a single soldier long ago were it not for this accursed neighbor , this den of murderers .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GENERAL</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>And what would we have done without any soldiers , Monsieur</l>
      <l>Lagard ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LAGARD</speaker>
     <p>And what can we do with soldiers , Monsieur General ? COUNT CLAIRMONT You are wrong , Lagard . With our little army there is still one possibility — to die as freemen die . But without an army we would have been bootblacks , Lagard !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LAGARD</speaker>
     <p>Grumbling . Well , I would not clean anybody 's boots . Things are in bad shape , Grelieu , in very bad shape . And there is but one remedy left for us —. True , it is a terrible remedy .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>I know .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LAGARD</speaker>
     <p>Yes ? What is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>The dam . Jeanne and Emil shudder and look at each other with terror in their eyes . COUNT CLAIRMONT You shuddered , you are shuddering , madame . But what am I to do , what are we to do , we who dare not shudder ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , I simply thought of a girl who was trying to find her way to Lonua . She will never find her way to Lonua . COUNT CLAIRMONT But what is to be done ? What is to be done ? All become thoughtful . The Count steps away to the window and looks out , nervously twitching his mustaches . Maurice has moved aside and , as before , stands at attention . Jeanne stands a little distance away from him , with her shoulder leaning against the wall , her beautiful pale head thrown back . Lagard is sitting at the bedside as before , stroking his gray , disheveled beard . The General is absorbed in gloomy thoughts . COUNT CLAIRMONT Turning around resolutely . I am a peaceful man , but I can understand why people take up arms . Arms ! That means a sword , a gun , explosive contrivances . That is fire . Fire is killing people , but at the same time it also gives light . Fire cleanses . There is something of the ancient sacrifice in it . But water ! cold , dark , silent , covering with mire , causing bodies to swell — water , which was the beginning of chaos ; water , which is guarding the earth by day and night in order to rush upon it . My friend , believe me , I am quite a daring man , but I am afraid of water ! Lagard , what would you say to that ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LAGARD</speaker>
     <p>We Belgians have too long been struggling against the water not to have learned to fear it . I am also afraid of water .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>But what is more terrible , the Prussians or water ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GENERAL</speaker>
     <p>Bowing . Madame is right . The Prussians are not more terrible , but they are worse .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LAGARD</speaker>
     <p>Yes . We have no other choice . It is terrible to release water from captivity , the beast from its den , nevertheless it is a better friend to us than the Prussians . I would prefer to see the whole of Belgium covered with water rather than extend a hand of reconciliation to a scoundrel ! Neither they nor we shall live to see that , even if the entire Atlantic Ocean rush over our heads .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brief pause</speaker>
     <p>GENERAL But I hope that we shall not come to that . Meanwhile it is necessary for us to flood only part of our territory . That is not so terrible .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Her eyes closed , her head hanging down . And what is to be done with those who could not abandon their homes , who are deaf , who are sick and alone ? What will become of our children ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Silence</speaker>
     <p>JEANNE There in the fields and in the ditches are the wounded . There the shadows of people are wandering about , but in their veins there is still warm blood . What will become of them ? Oh , do n't look at me like that , Emil ; you had better not listen to what I am saying . I have spoken so only because my heart is wrung with pain — it is n't necessary to listen to me at all , Count . Count Clairmont walks over to Grelieu 's bed quickly and firmly . At first he speaks confusedly , seeking the right word ; then he speaks ever more boldly and firmly . COUNT CLAIRMONT My dear and honored master ! We would not have dared to take from you even a drop of your health , if — if it were not for the assurance that serving your people may give new strength to your heroic soul ! Yesterday , it was resolved at our council to break the dams and flood part of our kingdom , but I could not , I dared not , give my full consent before I knew what you had to say to this plan . I did not sleep all night long , thinking — oh , how terrible , how inexpressibly sad my thoughts were ! We are the body , we are the hands , we are the head — while you , Grelieu , you are the conscience of our people . Blinded by the war , we may unwillingly , unwittingly , altogether against our will , violate man-made laws . Let your noble heart tell us the truth . My friend ! We are driven to despair , we have no Belgium any longer , it is trampled by our enemies , but in your breast , Emil Grelieu , the heart of all Belgium is beating — and your answer will be the answer of our tormented , blood-stained , unfortunate land ! He turns away to the window . Maurice is crying , looking at his father .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LAGARD</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Softly .</l>
      <l>Bravo , Belgium !</l>
      <l>Silence . The sound of cannonading is heard .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Softly , to Maurice .</l>
      <l>Sit down , Maurice , it is hard for you to stand .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Oh , mamma ! I am so happy to stand here now —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LAGARD</speaker>
     <p>Now I shall add a few words . As you know , Grelieu , I am a man of the people . I know the price the people pay for their hard work . I know the cost of all these gardens , orchards and factories which we shall bury under the water . They have cost us sweat and health and tears , Grelieu . These are our sufferings which will be transformed into joy for our children . But as a nation that loves and respects liberty above its sweat and blood and tears — as a nation , I say , I would prefer that sea waves should seethe here over our heads rather than that we should have to black the boots of the Prussians . And if nothing but islands remain of Belgium they will be known as “ honest islands , ” and the islanders will be Belgians as before . All are agitated .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>And what do the engineers say ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GENERAL</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Respectfully waiting for the Count 's answer .</l>
      <l>Monsieur Grelieu , they say this can be done in two hours .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LAGARD</speaker>
     <p>Grumbles . In two hours ! In two hours ! How many years have we been building it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GENERAL</speaker>
     <p>The engineers were crying when they said it , Monsieur .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LAGARD</speaker>
     <p>The engineers were crying ? But how could they help crying ? Think of it , Grelieu ! Suddenly he bursts into sobs , and slowly takes a handkerchief from his pocket . COUNT CLAIRMONT We are awaiting your answer impatiently , Grelieu . You are charged with a grave responsibility to your fatherland — to lift your hand against your own fatherland . EMIL GRELIEU Have we no other defence ? Silence . All stand in poses of painful anxiety . Lagard dries his eyes and slowly answers with a sigh .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>LAGARD</speaker>
     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GENERAL</speaker>
     <p>No .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Shaking her head .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>No</speaker>
     <p>COUNT CLAIRMONT</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Rapidly</speaker>
     <p>We must gain time , Grelieu . By the power of all our lives , thrown in the fields , we cannot stop them . Stamping his foot . Time , time ! We must steal from fate a small part of eternity — a few days , a week ! They are hastening to us . The Russians are coming to us from the East . The German steel has already penetrated to the heart of the French land — and infuriated with pain , the French eagle is rising over the Germans ’ bayonets and is coming toward us ! The noble knights of the sea — the British — are already rushing toward us , and to Belgium are their powerful arms stretched out over the abyss . But , time , time ! Give us time , Grelieu . Belgium is praying for a few days , for a few hours ! You have already given to Belgium your blood , Grelieu , and you have the right to lift your hand against your blood-stained fatherland !</p>

     <stage>Night . A small house occupied by the German staff . A sentinel on guard at the door leading to the rooms occupied by the Commander of the army . All the doors and windows are open . The room is illuminated with candles . Two officers on duty are talking lazily , suffering apparently from the heat . All is quiet in the camp .

     <p>I do n't feel sleepy , but I feel like smoking .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RITZAU</speaker>
     <p>A bad habit ! But you may smoke near the window .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEIN</speaker>
     <p>But what if he should come in ? Thank you , von Ritzau . What a stifling night ! Not a breath of pure air enters the lungs . The air is poisoned with the smell of smoke . We must invent something against this obnoxious odor . Take it up , Ritzau .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RITZAU</speaker>
     <p>I am not an inventor . First of all it is necessary to wring out the air as they wring the clothes they wash , and dry it in the sun . It is so moist , I feel as though I were diving in it . Do you know whether he is in a good mood today ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEIN</speaker>
     <p>Why , is he subject to moods , good or bad ?</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Great self-restraint !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEIN</speaker>
     <p>Have you ever seen him undressed — or half-dressed ? Or have you ever seen his hair in disorder ? He is a wonderful old man !</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>RITZAU</speaker>
     <p>He speaks so devilishly little , Stein .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEIN</speaker>
     <p>He prefers to have his cannon speak . It is quite a powerful voice , is n't it , Ritzau ? They laugh softly . A tall , handsome officer enters quickly and goes toward the door leading to the room of the Commander . Blumenfeld ! Any news ? The tall officer waves his hand and opens the door cautiously , ready to make his bow . He is malting his career !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RITZAU</speaker>
     <p>He is a good fellow . I can n't bear it , Stein . I am suffocating here .</p>

     <speaker>STEIN</speaker>
     <p>Would you rather be in Paris ?</p>

     <p>I would prefer any less unbearable country to this . How dull it must be here in the winter time .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEIN</speaker>
     <p>But we have saved them from dullness for a long time to come . Were you ever in the Montmartre cafés , Ritzau ?</p>

     <p>Of course !</p>
    </sp>

     <p>Does n't one find there a wonderful refinement , culture and innate elegance ? Unfortunately , our Berlin people are far different .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RITZAU</speaker>
     <p>Oh , of course . Great ! The tall officer comes out of the door , stepping backward . He heaves a sigh of relief and sits down near the two officers . Takes out a cigar . VON BLUMENFELD How are things ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RITZAU</speaker>
     <p>Very well . We were talking of Paris .</p>

     <p>Then I am going to smoke too .</p>

     <p>You may smoke . He is not coming out Do you want to hear important news ?</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLUMENFELD</speaker>
     <p>Upon my word of honor ! And he touched my shoulder with two fingers — do you understand ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEIN</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>With envy .</l>
      <l>Of course ! I suppose you brought him good news , Blumenfeld ?</l>
      <l>The military telegraphist , standing at attention , hands</l>
      <l>Blumenfeld a folded paper .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>TELEGRAPHIST</speaker>
     <p>A radiogram , Lieutenant !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLUMENFELD</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Let me have it .</l>
      <l>Slowly he puts his cigar on the window sill and enters the</l>
      <l>Commander 's room cautiously .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEIN</speaker>
     <p>He 's a lucky fellow . You may say what you please about luck , but it exists . Who is this Blumenfeld ? Von ?— Did you know his father ? Or his grandfather ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RITZAU</speaker>
     <p>I have reason to believe that he had no grandfather at all . But he is a good comrade . Blumenfeld comes out and rejoins the two officers , taking up his cigar .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEIN</speaker>
     <p>Another military secret ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLUMENFELD</speaker>
     <p>Of course . Everything that is said and done here is a military secret . But I may tell you about it . The information we have received concerns our new siege guns — they are advancing successfully .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEIN</speaker>
     <p>Oho !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLUMENFELD</speaker>
     <p>Yes , successfully . They have just passed the most difficult part of the road — you know where the swamps are —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEIN</speaker>
     <p>Oh , yes .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RITZAU</speaker>
     <p>Great !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLUMENFELD</speaker>
     <p>The road could not support the heavy weight and caved in . Our commander was very uneasy . He ordered a report about the movement at each and every kilometer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEIN</speaker>
     <p>Now he will sleep in peace .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLUMENFELD</speaker>
     <p>He never sleeps , von Stein .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEIN</speaker>
     <p>That 's true .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLUMENFELD</speaker>
     <p>He never sleeps , von Stein ! When he is not listening to reports or issuing commands , he is thinking . As the personal correspondent of his Highness I have the honor to know many things which others are not allowed to know — Oh , gentlemen , he has a wonderful mind !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RITZAU</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Great !</l>
      <l>Another very young officer enters , stands at attention before</l>
      <l>Blumenfeld .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLUMENFELD</speaker>
     <p>Sit down , von Schauss . I am talking about our Commander .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHAUSS</speaker>
     <p>Oh !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLUMENFELD</speaker>
     <p>He has a German philosophical mind which manages guns as Leibnitz managed ideas . Everything is preconceived , everything is prearranged , the movement of our millions of people has been elaborated into such a remarkable system that Kant himself would have been proud of it . Gentlemen , we are led forward by indomitable logic and by an iron will . We are inexorable as Fate . The officers express their approval by subdued exclamations of “ bravo . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLUMENFELD</speaker>
     <p>How can he sleep , if the movement of our armies is but the movement of parts of his brains ! And what is the use of sleep in general ? I sleep very little myself , and I advise you , gentlemen , not to indulge in foolish sleep .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RITZAU</speaker>
     <p>But our human organism requires sleep .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLUMENFELD</speaker>
     <p>Nonsense ! Organism — that is something invented by the doctors who are looking for practice among the fools . I know of no organism . I know only my desires and my will , which says : “ Gerhardt , do this ! Gerhardt , go there ! Gerhardt , take this ! ” And I take it !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RITZAU</speaker>
     <p>Great !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>SCHAUSS</speaker>
     <p>Will you permit me to take down your words in my notebook ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLUMENFELD</speaker>
     <p>Please , Schauss . What is it you want , Zigler ? The telegraphist has entered .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ZIGLER</speaker>
     <p>I really do n't know , but something strange has happened . It seems that we are being interfered with , I can n't understand anything .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLUMENFELD</speaker>
     <p>What is it ? What is the matter ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ZIGLER</speaker>
     <p>We can make out one word , “ Water ” — but after that all is incomprehensible . And then again , “ Water ” —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLUMENFELD</speaker>
     <p>What water ? You are intoxicated , Zigler . That must be wine , not water . Is the engineer there ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ZIGLER</speaker>
     <p>He is also surprised and cannot understand .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLUMENFELD</speaker>
     <p>You are a donkey , Zigler ! We 'll have to call out — The Commander comes out . He is a tall , erect old man . His face is pale . His voice is dry and unimpassioned .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COMMANDER</speaker>
     <p>Blumenfeld ! All jump up , straighten themselves , as if petrified .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>What is this ?</speaker>
     <p>BLUMENFELD I have not yet investigated it , your Highness . Zigler is reporting —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COMMANDER</speaker>
     <p>What is it , Zigler ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ZIGLER</speaker>
     <p>Your Highness , we are being interfered with . I do n't know what it is , but I can n't understand anything . We have been able to make out only one word — “ Water . ” Then again — “ Water . ”</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COMMANDER</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Turning around .</l>
      <l>See what it is , Blumenfeld , and report to me —</l>
      <l>Engineer runs in .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ENGINEER</speaker>
     <p>Where is Blumenfeld ? I beg your pardon , your Highness !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COMMANDER</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Pausing .</l>
      <l>What has happened there , Kloetz ?</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ENGINEER</speaker>
     <p>They do n't respond to our calls , your Highness . They are silent like the dead . Something has happened there .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COMMANDER</speaker>
     <p>You think something serious has happened ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>ENGINEER</speaker>
     <p>I dare not think so , your Highness , but I am alarmed . Silence is the only answer to our most energetic calls . But Greitzer wishes to say something . ... Well ? What is it , Greitzer ? The second telegraphist has entered quietly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>GREITZER</speaker>
     <p>They are silent , your Highness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Brief pause</speaker>
     <p>COMMANDER Again turning to the door . Please investigate this , Lieutenant . He advances a step to the door , then stops . There is a commotion behind the windows — a noise and the sound of voices . The word “ water ” is repeated frequently . The noise keeps growing , turning at times into a loud roar .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>What is that ?</speaker>
     <p>All turn to the window . An officer , bareheaded , rushes in excitedly , his hair disheveled , his face pale .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
     <p>I want to see his Highness . I want to see his Highness !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLUMENFELD</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Hissing .</l>
      <l>You are insane !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COMMANDER</speaker>
     <p>Calm yourself , officer .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Your Highness ! I have the honor to report to you that the</l>
      <l>Belgians have burst the dams , and our armies are flooded . Water !</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>With horror</speaker>
     <p>We must hurry , your Highness !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COMMANDER</speaker>
     <p>Hurry ! I ask you to calm yourself , officer . What about our guns ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
     <p>They are flooded , your Highness .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COMMANDER</speaker>
     <p>Compose yourself , you are not behaving properly ! I am asking you about our field guns —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
     <p>They are flooded , your Highness . The water is coming this way . We must hurry , your Highness , we are in a valley . This place is very low . They have broken the dams ; and the water is rushing this way violently . It is only five kilometers away from here — and we can hardly —. I beg your pardon , your Highness ! Silence . The commotion without is growing louder . Glimmering lights appear . The beginning of a terrible panic is felt , embracing the entire camp . All watch impatiently the reddening face of the Commander .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COMMANDER</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>But this is —</l>
      <l>He strikes the table with his fist forcibly .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Absurd !</speaker>
     <p>He looks at them with cold fury , but all lower their eyes . The frightened officer is trembling and gazing at the window . The lights grow brighter outside — it is evident that a building has been set on fire . The voices without have turned into a roar . A dull noise , then the crash of shots is heard . The discipline is disappearing gradually .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLUMENFELD</speaker>
     <p>They have gone mad !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
     <p>They are firing ! It is an attack !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>STEIN</speaker>
     <p>But that can n't be the Belgians !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>RITZAU</speaker>
     <p>They may have availed themselves —</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLUMENFELD</speaker>
     <p>Are n't you ashamed , Stein ? Are n't you ashamed , gentlemen ? COMMANDER Silence ! I beg of you — Suddenly a piercing , wild sound of a horn is heard ordering to retreat . The roaring sound is growing rapidly .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COMMANDER</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>Shots .</l>
      <l>Who has commanded to retreat ? Who dares command when I am here ?</l>
      <l>What a disgrace , Blumenfeld ! Order them to return !</l>
      <l>Blumenfeld lowers his head .</l>
     </lg>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>COMMANDER</speaker>
     <p>This is not the German Army ! You are unworthy of being called soldiers ! Shame ! I am ashamed to call myself your general ! Cowards !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLUMENFELD</speaker>
     <p>Stepping forward , with dignity .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Your Highness !</speaker>
     <p>OFFICER Eh ! We are not fishes to swim in the water ! Runs out , followed by two or three others . The panic is growing .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLUMENFELD</speaker>
     <p>Your Highness ! We ask you —. Your life is in danger — your Highness . Some one else runs out . The room is almost empty . Only the sentinel remains in the position of one petrified .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>BLUMENFELD</speaker>
     <p>Your Highness ! I implore you . Your life — I am afraid that another minute , and it will be too late ! Oh , your Highness !</p>

     <speaker>COMMANDER</speaker>
     <lg>
      <l>But this is —</l>

     <stage>The same hour of night . In the darkness it is difficult to discern the silhouettes of the ruined buildings and of the trees . At the right , a half-destroyed bridge . In the distance a fire is burning . From time to time the German flashlights are seen across the dark sky . Near the bridge , an automobile in which the wounded Emil Grelieu and his son are being carried to Antwerp . Jeanne and a young physician are with them . Something has broken down in the automobile and a soldier-chauffeur is bustling about with a lantern trying to repair it . Dr. Langloi stands near him .</stage>

     <p>Father , they are flashing the searchlights across the sky like madmen . Look , look ! A bluish light is flashed over them , faintly illuminating the whole group .</p>

    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Right into my eyes ! Does that come from an elevation , father ?</p>

     <p>Father , it seems to me I hear voices . Listen — it sounds as though they are crying there . Many , many people . Father , the Prussians are crying . It is they ! A distant , dull roaring of a crowd is heard . Then the crash of shots resounds . Sobs of military horns . The searchlights are swaying from side to side .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>It is they .</p>

     <p>Father , how beautiful and how terrible it is ! Give me your hand , mother .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>What is it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>I want to kiss it . Mother , you have no gloves on !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>What a foolish little boy you are , Maurice .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Monsieur Langloi said that in three days from now I may remove my bandage . Just think of it , in three days I shall be able to take up my gun again !... Oh , who is that ? Look , who is that ? All near the automobile assume defensive positions . The chauffeur and the doctor draw their revolvers . A figure appears from the field , approaching from one of the ditches . A peasant , wounded in the leg , comes up slowly , leaning upon a cane .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Who is there ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEASANT</speaker>
     <p>Our own , our own . And who are you ? Are you going to the city ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Yes , we 're going to the city . Our car has broken down , we 're repairing it . What are you doing here ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEASANT</speaker>
     <p>What am I doing here ? Examines the unfamiliar faces curiously . They also look at him attentively , by the light of the lantern .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>CHAUFFEUR</speaker>
     <p>Give me the light !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEASANT</speaker>
     <p>Are you carrying a wounded man ? I am also wounded , in my leg . I cannot walk , it is very hard . I must lean on my cane . Are you going to the city ? I lay there in the ditch and when I heard you speak French I crawled out . My name is Jaqular .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOCTOR</speaker>
     <p>How were you wounded ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEASANT</speaker>
     <p>I was walking in the field and they shot me . They must have thought I was a rabbit . Laughs hoarsely . They must have thought I was a rabbit . What is the news , gentlemen ? Is our Belgium lost ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>Laughs</speaker>
     <p>Eh ? Is our Belgium lost ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Do n't you know ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEASANT</speaker>
     <p>What can I know ? I lay there and looked at the sky — that 's all I know . Did you see the sky ? Just look at it , I have been watching it all the time . What is that I see in the sky , eh ? How would you explain it ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>EMIL GRELIEU</speaker>
     <p>Sit down near us .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Listen , sit down here . It seems you have n't heard anything . You must get away from here . Do you know that the dams are broken ? Do you understand ? The dams !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEASANT</speaker>
     <p>The dams ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Yes . Do n't you hear the cries over there ? Listen ! They are crying there — the Prussians !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEASANT</speaker>
     <p>Water ?</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Water . It must be reaching them now . They must have learned of it by this time . Listen , it is so far , and yet we can hear ! The peasant laughs hoarsely .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>Sit down , right here , the automobile is large . Doctor , help him . I will hold the lantern .</p>

    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>DOCTOR</speaker>
     <p>Uneasily . What is it ? Bad ? Chauffeur , be quick ! We can n't stay here ! The water is coming . We should have started out earlier .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>
     <p>What an unfortunate mishap !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>Agitated . They shot you like a rabbit ? Do you hear , Emil — they thought a rabbit was running ! Did you resemble a rabbit so closely ? She laughs loudly , the peasant also laughs .</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>PEASANT</speaker>
     <p>I look like a rabbit ! Exactly like a rabbit .</p>

     <p>JEANNE It makes me laugh — it seems so comical to me that they mistake us for rabbits . And now , what are we now — water rats ? Emil , just picture to yourself , water rats in an automobile !</p>
    </sp>
    <sp>
     <speaker>MAURICE</speaker>

    <sp>
     <speaker>JEANNE</speaker>
     <p>No , never mind , I am not laughing any more . How foolish you are . Maurice , I simply felt like talking . I was silent too long . I was forever silent , but just now I felt like chattering . Emil , I am not disturbing you with my talk , am I ? Why is the water so quiet , Emil ? It was the King who said , “ The water is silent , ” was it not ? But I should like to see it roar , crash like thunder .... No , I cannot , I cannot bear this silence ! Ah , why is it so quiet — I cannot bear it !</p>
    </sp>
