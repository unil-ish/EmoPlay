      <stage type="setting">
       <stage>SCENE : A vast room in the palace of Hudibrand . As the curtain rises the place is in darkness save for a circlet of gold apparently suspended in mid-air near the centre of the room . As the light increases , the outline of a man 's figure becomes distinguishable , and the circlet is seen to be resting on his head . Gradually the rim of gold fades to invisibility , while the figure of the man and the contents of the room become clear to the eye . The man might be mistaken for an American citizen in customary evening dress . He is Hudibrand .</stage>
       <stage>At the left are two entrances , upper and lower . Rear , left , large windows . The wall rear makes a right angle about centre , the apex of which is cut off by a window . Right of centre the room seems to extend endlessly rearward , and is arranged to suggest an upland grove in the delicate , venturing days of spring . The ground , rising a little toward right , is covered with winter moss and tufts of short silvered grass . The trees are young birch , slight maples in coral leaf , cornel in flower , and an occasional dark foil of cedar . A brooklet ripples down the slope and off rear . Birds chirp and flit , and now and then a breeze stirs the grove as if it were one tender body . The lights are arranged to give the effect of night or day as one wishes .</stage>
       <stage>It is winter without , the climate of Assaria 's capital city being similar to that of New York .</stage>
       <stage>Double doors lower right , through which Count Dorkinski enters to Hudibrand .</stage>

        <l>I thought I left the springtide in my rear ,</l>

        <l>I juggle too with seasons , climates , zones ,</l>
        <l>But in the open where there 's warrior room ,</l>
        <l>And startled Fate may spring against my will ,</l>
        <l>Giving an edge to mastery when I wrest</l>
        <l>The whip from Nature , turn it on herself ,</l>
        <l>And set her elemental slaves to filch</l>
        <l>Her gold for me . That , friend , is play .</l>

        <l>Men have said</l>
        <l>I pile up gold because its glitter soothes</l>
        <l>A fever in my eyes . The clacking fools !</l>
        <l>I am no Cheops making warts on earth .</l>
        <l>No mummy brain ! God built my pyramids ,</l>
        <l>Slaving through dark and chaos till there rose</l>
        <l>My iron-hearted hills , and mountains locked</l>
        <l>On ago-unyielded treasure waiting me .</l>
        <l>There slept my gems till longing became fire</l>
        <l>And broke the grip of stone ,— there lay my gold ,</l>
        <l>Re-purged each thousand years till baited Time</l>
        <l>Gave up the master 's hour .</l>

        <l>That bears the flower of you , and to the light</l>
        <l>That makes my eyes your beauty 's treasurer .</l>
        <l>But thanks from you to me , as jewels hung</l>
        <l>Upon a beggar 's neck , would set my rags</l>

        <l>My fair Peonia , paling in treason 's grip ,</l>
        <l>Thrilled from her deathward droop , renewed her heart</l>
        <l>Through safe , ease-lidded nights , and woke once more</l>

        <l>That is not kin with it . A sea that once</l>
        <l>Was mine , and I could go , with circling arms ,</l>

        <l>Is round me fathomless ——</l>

        <l>Her mountain shoulders with their pendent clouds .</l>
        <l>Lakes where a dreamer 's bark may drift unoared</l>
        <l>And chance no port save beauty . Everywhere</l>

      <stage>As they talk , men and women enter in groups of scores and dozens until there are several hundred in the yard . They are mostly of mixed blood , their color ranging from the full brown of the Maya to the pale olive of the Peonian aristocrat . At a spout , upper left , they wash their hands , then drop about wearily . One man sits near Famette , his head sunk on his chest . She lays her hand on his shoulder</stage>

        <l>As ‘ twere half accident , from his high thoughts</l>

       <p><stage>Reads letter</stage>When you see the princess Hernda , kiss for me the hand that gave me freedom . It was she unlocked my dungeon and nursed my bones to life . What I am is hers , and therefore yours . Le Val . Hast grown so spent , O Fortune , that one stroke Must deal both death and life ?— with hand that parts The night , show too my rainbow loss ?.... All , all My future sold to the gray usurer Grief , Who gathers up as sapped and withered leaves Time 's unimagined buds ! No eve , no dawn With Hernda ! No brief night that makes The sun unwelcome as he golds desire , The warm mist-flower where we lie its heart ! Unbrace thee here , my courage ! Valiancy , First god and last in man , unbuckle here ! ... How meet Famette ? Smile on her smiles ? Deceive Her love ? She 'll lay her head upon my heart And hear it crying “ Hernda ! ” .... Hernda lost ! I must not dream here open to the risk Of her unanswered eyes . Their lure would make Dishonor , that on wreck feeds rampant , spring Unshamed in me . I would forsake Famette .</p>

If Charilus will come to Suli Castle , the which my swords have taken while you sang and slept , my door shall open to him as Kidmir gates have opened unto you . By Christ , I swear the treatment that he gave my blood he shall have again from me . But if he come not down , then shall I reach him through Avesta 's heart , and the love he now spurns will be cold in my sword . Despatch this , I pray you , for I would hasten to Jerusalem , leaving you my conquered princedom , whose head is Ilon and whose foot is the city of Ramoor .

A song is heard within</stage>What save winds shall kiss his bones Bleaching on the desert stones ? What but waves o'er him shall sigh Who doth drowned sea-deep lie ? What save worms to him shall come Locked in earth , bound , keyless , dumb ? Wild the wind and cold the wave , Sharp the tooth within the grave ! Be such kisses for my ghost , Heart , my Heart , when thou art lost ! Love me , Love , an hour and we Mock the cold eternity !</p>

         <l>Nay , that .... I 'll tell you that . I thought of Love ,</l>
         <l>Man 's angel , and the heart-lone way of him</l>
         <l>Who missed and found her not . Never to take</l>
         <l>More courage from the fall of her sure feet</l>
         <l>On heights that wind between death and the stars ;</l>
         <l>Or where his road burns through the shadeless sands ,</l>
         <l>Reach for the hand with fountains in its touch</l>
         <l>And feel the palm-breath round him . Not to know</l>
         <l>Her eyes when night is come , and there 's no star ;</l>
         <l>Her breast , that pillowing the darkened waste ,</l>
         <l>Keeps warm the bitten earth and gives him dream</l>
         <l>To meet and match the dawn . So wept my thoughts ,</l>
         <l>Forgetting that you are no wanderer ,</l>
         <l>But kingly housed will rule a tamed realm .</l>
         <l>Or should a harvest come of spears , not grain ,</l>
         <l>Yet is your princess brave and beautiful ,</l>
         <l>And bears , may be , a mating heart . Love then</l>
         <l>Will come to you ——</l>

        <p>Hear the full tale , my friends . I swear The earl of Clyffe died for no more offence Than I have here set out ,— and I , his only son , Kissed his red wounds and from his breast unbound This bloody scarf —<stage>taking scarf from his bosom</stage>that then was crimson , now In age-grown black bemourns my step that comes So sluggish to revenge . For thirty years Had passed ere I beheld his murderer , Then face to face we stood ... and face to face We stand ... for this is he , this Charilus Of Kidmir — peace-lipped Cain — gray hypocrite , Whose blood is honey in his veins , whose eyes Stare on the world as he were some bland god Who made it and said “ good . ”</p>
