    <docTitle><titlePart>That it is a fatal error to bring up children , either boys or girls , in ignorance of their sexual nature is the thesis of Frank Wedekind 's drama aEurooeFrA1 / 4hlings Erwachen. aEuro  From its title one might suppose it a peaceful little idyl of the youth of the year . No idea a could be more mistaken . It is a tragedy of frightful import , and its action is concerned with the development of natural instincts in the adolescent of both sexes . The playwright has attacked his theme with European frankness ; but of plot , in the usual acceptance of the term , there is little . Instead of the coherent drama of conventional type , Wedekind has given us a series of loosely connected scenes illuminative of character — scenes which surely have profound significance for all occupied in the training of the young . He sets before us a group of school children , lads and lassies just past the age of puberty , and shows logically that death and degradation may be their lot as the outcome of parental reticence . They are not vicious children , but little ones such as we meet every day , imaginative beings living in a world of youthful ideals and speculating about the mysteries which surround them . Wendla , sent to her grave by the abortive administered with the connivance of her affectionate but mistaken mother , is a most lovable creature , while Melchior , the father of her unborn child , is a high type of boy whose downfall is due to a philosophic temperament , which leads him to inquire into the nature of life and to impart his knowledge to others ; a temperament which , under proper guidance , would make him a useful , intelligent man . It is Melchior 's very excellence of character which proves his undoing . That he should be imprisoned as a moral degenerate only serves to illustrate the stupidity of his parents and teachers . As for the suicide of Moritz , the imaginative youth who kills himself because he has failed in his examinations , that is another crime for which the dramatist makes false educational methods responsible . A grim vein of humor is exhibited now and then , as when we are introduced to the conference room in which the members of a gymnasium faculty , met to consider the regulation of their pupils ’ morals , sit beneath the portraits of Pestalozzi and J. J. Rousseau disputing with considerable acrimony about the opening and shutting of a window . The exchange of unpleasant personalities is interrupted only by the entrance of the accused student , to whose defense the faculty refuses to listen , having marked the boy for expulsion prior to the formal farce of his trial . Wedekind has been accused of depicting his adults as too ignorant and too indifferent to the needs of the younger generation . But most of us will have to admit that the majority of his scenes and characters seem very true to life .</titlePart></docTitle>

   <performance>aEurooeFrA1 / 4hlings ErwachenaEuro  may not be pleasant reading exactly , but there is no forgetting it after one has perused it ; there is an elemental strength about it which grips the intellect . As a play it stands unique in the annals of dramatic art . That it has succeeded in attracting much attention abroad is shown by the fact that this drama in book form has gone through twenty-six editions in its original version and has been translated into several European tongues , Russian included , while stage performances of the work have been given in France as well as in Germany .</performance>
   <titlePage>
    <docImprint>The Teutonic grimness of the work puzzled the Parisians , who are not used to having philosophy thrust at them over the footlights ; but in<country>Germany</country>aEurooeFrA1 / 4hlings ErwachenaEuro  proved much more successful . In<settlement>Berlin</settlement>, indeed , it has become part of the regular stock of plays acted at aEurooeDas Neue Theater , aEuro  where it is said to be certain of drawing a crowded audience . That the play is radically different from anything given on the American stage is undoubtedly true . It must be remembered , however , that the Continental European playwright regards the stage as a medium of instruction , as well as a place of amusement . The dictum of the Swedish dramatist , August Strindberg , that the playwright should be a lay priest preaching on vital topics of the day in a way to make them intelligible to mediocre intellects , is not appreciated in this country as it should be ; but once admit the kinship of dramatist and priest , and the position taken by Wedekind in writing aEurooeFrA1 / 4hlings ErwachenaEuro  becomes self-evident . There should be no question concerning the importance of his topic , nor should it be forgotten that the evident lesson he seeks to inculcate is one now preached by numerous ethical teachers . In order to estimate the relationship of this play toward modern thought in<country>Germany</country>, it must be understood that Wedekind 's tragedy is merely one of the documents in a paper war which has resulted at last in having the physiology of sex taught in many German schools . The fact that Wedekind 's dialogue is frank to a remarkable degree only makes his preachment more effective : aEurooeOne does not cure the pest with attar of roses , aEuro  as St. Augustine remarked . Conditions in this country are not so very different from those depicted in this play , and evidence is not lacking that gradually , very gradually , we are beginning to realize that ignorance and innocence are not synonymous ; that an evil is not palliated by ignoring its existence ; the Podsnappian wave of the hand has not disappeared entirely , but it is not quite as fashionable as of yore . All things considered , the moment seems appropriate for the publication , of aEurooeFrA1 / 4hlings ErwachenaEuro  in an English version . The translation given in this volume follows the German original as closely as the translator can reconcile the nature of the two languages . Considered as a work of literature , aEurooeFrA1 / 4hlings ErwachenaEuro  is remarkable as one of the few realistic studies of adolescence . Its deceptive simplicity is the hall mark of that supreme literary ability which knows how to conceal art by art . Dealing with adolescence , an unformed period of human life , it is necessarily without the climaxes we expect in dramas in which the characters are adult , and the gruesome scene in the churchyard with which the play closes — a scene with such peculiar symbolism could spring only from a Teutonic imagination — leaves much unended . It is interesting to note , by the way , that Wedekind himself appears as the Masked Man when aEurooeFrA1 / 4hlings ErwachenaEuro  is given in<settlement>Berlin</settlement>, a fact which gives this scene somewhat the nature of a parabasis .</docImprint>
    <docTitle><titlePart>Frank Wedekind 's name is just beginning to be heard in America . In Germany he has been recognized for some time as one of the leaders in the new art of the theatre . Naturally enough , his plays are too outspoken in their realism to appeal to all his fellow-countrymen . But , if certain Germans reject this mental pabulum , others become intoxicated by it , and , waxing enthusiastic with a flow of language almost bacchic , hail Wedekind as the forerunner of a new drama — as a power destined to infuse fresh strength into the German stage . aEurooeWith this drink in its body , aEuro  writes one admirer , aEurooethe public will never more endure lyrical lemonade , nor the dregs of dramatic penury. aEuro </titlePart></docTitle>
    <docImprint>Again , these enthusiasts compare Wedekind 's work to that of the pre-Shakesperian dramatists , or even to that of the Bard of Avon himself , both of which comparisons are difficult to grasp by an English-speaking student of the British drama . Wedekind , it is true , has a habit of using the news of the day as material for plays , just as the old English dramatists did when they wrote aEurooedomestic tragedies. aEuro  He has a fondness , moreover , for gruesome situations such as we can imagine appealing to the melancholy genius of Webster ; but of the childlike simplicity which marks much of the Elizabethan drama there is not a particle . Certainly there is no trace of the gentle romanticism which one finds in some of the other modern German realists . Gerhart Hauptmann can turn from the grim task of dramatizing starvation , as he does in aEurooeDie Weber , aEuro  to indulge in the naA-ve Christian symbolism of aEurooeHannele , aEuro  or the mythological poetry of aEurooeDie Versunkene Glocke. aEuro  Even the iconoclast Strindberg writes romantically at times , and gives us something resembling Maeterlinck ; but when Wedekind departs from pure realism his fancy creates a Gothic nightmare of horrors , peopled with such terrifying creatures as the headless suicide wandering amid the graves . Wedekind 's kinship to the dramatists of the aEurooedomestic tragediesaEuro  is shown clearly in the tragedy aEurooeMusik , aEuro  which deals with a phase of music study only too common in<country>Germany</country>. It is asserted that of the thousands of students of music in that country not one in a hundred amounts to anything artistically , while of those who master their art not one in a thousand is capable of profiting financially by it . It is this condition of affairs which gives additional importance to this recent work of Wedekind . aEurooeMusikaEuro  is described by the author as a depiction of morals in four pictures ( aEurooeSittengemA ¤ lde in vier BildernaEuro ) , to each of which he has given a separate title , a method which enables him to indulge in his trick of applying a pretty , inoffensive name to a tragic subject , as he does in picture two of this series , which he calls aEurooeBehind Swedish Curtains , aEuro  and which represents the interior of a jail . The curtains to which the playwright refers are the iron bars of the prison . The central character in aEurooeMusik , aEuro  Klara Huhnerwadel , is a neurotic girl , whose mad love for her singing teacher has entangled her in the meshes of the legal net drawn to catch Madame Fischer , a notorious character in real life , who actively engaged the attention of the German police authorities not long ago . At the instigation of her lover , Josef Reissner , and with money supplied by Else Reissner , Josef 's wife , Klara flees to Antwerp , only to find existence insupportable there , and to return to a life in jail which drives her to the edge of insanity . Released from imprisonment , she continues her relationship with her teacher until their association becomes public scandal , and then takes refuge in the country , intending to devote her life to her illegitimate child . The child dies , however , and there descends upon Klara what Wedekind describes as aEurooethe curse of the ridiculous. aEuro  In an outburst of frightful anguish she is filled with aEurooea nameless loathing of the horrible fate of being racked to death by bursts of sneering laughter , aEuro  and raves in hysteria by the bedside of her dead baby . Upon this final picture Wedekind has expended his full power of biting irony . Josef Reissner , the cause of Klara 's misfortune , is thanked by her mother for all he has done for her , while Franz Lindekuh , a literary man , whose rA'le in the play has been that of a good Samaritan , is accused as the author of her disgrace . During previous tribulations Reissner has assured Klara repeatedly that her suffering would develop her artistic temperament and result in bringing her fame as a singer . At the end , when Klara , after undergoing imprisonment , exile , poverty , public disgrace and the loss of her beloved child , finds herself bereft of even Reissner 's regard , she is led away in a stupor from her miserable attic . It is then , in reply to a wish of the physician that she will suffer from no lasting mental disturbance , that Lindekuh preludes the fall of the curtain by the caustic remark : aEurooeShe 'll be able to sing a song. aEuro  Here , truly , is a tragedy ! There can be no doubt but what Wedekind has handled it in a powerful fashion . He sounds the tragic note upon the first rising of the curtain , a note which grows in intensity until the auditor wonders if it is possible for it to reach higher —— and yet it swells .</docImprint>
   </titlePage>
   <performance>aEurooeFrA1 / 4hlings ErwachenaEuro  is the best known of the Wedekind dramas and the most original in its treatment . It has peculiarities , however , which make it somewhat difficult to give as a stage performance . To see what this German playwright can do on more conservative lines , and to appreciate his mastership of the conventional technique of the stage , one must turn to the dramas of modern life in which he handles such subjects as socialism , woman 's emancipation , naturalism and divorce ; frequently , it must be confessed , in a way which Americans refuse to tolerate upon the stage , despite their fondness for the same sort of information when supplied by the newspapers . Selecting his characters from all classes of life , Wedekind brings to their making the knowledge of life as the police reporter sees it plus the science of a skilled psychologist . There is something sardonic about his art . He does not appear to sympathize with any of his characters , but to stand outside of life making note of the foibles and failures of his fellow-creatures . His irony appears in the most tragic places , and his dialogue , wrought with a cunning which requires strict attention on the part of the auditor if its subtleties would be grasped , serves Wedekind as an instrument for dissecting souls which he wields quite regardless of the mess he may make in the operating room . None knows better how to show the peculiarities of a neurotic woman , or to betray a man 's weakness by a few short sentences . The demonstration is direct and thorough , and we watch it fascinated , as we might the work of a skilled vivisectionist . When the job is finished we feel convinced that Wedekind 's personages are real , although many of them are not the kind we enjoy meeting in actual life . We do meet them daily , nevertheless , tolerating them chiefly by our own polite habit of ascribing imaginary virtues to those that possess them not . Take that curious comedy , aEurooeDer Marquis von Keith , aEuro  as an example of Wedekind 's skill as a psychologist . aEurooeComedyaEuro  the author names it himself , but he might just as well have called it a tragic farce , so thoroughly has he mingled the laughable with the tragic . The protagonist of this peculiar play ( the underlying tone of which has been likened musically to a Dies Irae written by Offenbach ) is the illegitimate son of a teacher of mathematics and a gypsy trull , an adventurer who keeps on the shady side of the law , and who , despite his practical view of life in general , is an idealist in several particulars . His title of Marquis von Keith is merely a nom de guerre , and his attempts to obtain a fortune involve methods which the world acclaims as evidences of wonderful financial ability , or stigmatizes as the practices of a sharper , according to their success or failure . Resourceful , energetic , unhampered by vain regrets or restrictions of conventional morals , wasting not a moment upon a scheme which has proved unprofitable , von Keith is a forceful personage who manages to pass in Munich as a wealthy American , even when his pockets are empty and the sheriff is at the door . His own view of life is embodied in his definition of sin as aEurooethe mythological symbol for bad business , aEuro  and his accompanying explanation that good business can be conducted only by a person accepted by the existing order of society . In other words , von Keith is a hypocrite for revenue only , but never is deceived concerning his own personality . The play deals with von Keith 's scheme to build an amusement hall , to be known as aEurooeThe Fairy Palace. aEuro  He applies himself so sedulously that his plans are on the eve of realization , when suddenly he finds himself ousted from the management of his own enterprise by the very men he has interested in it . Now all this is comedy , of course , but Wedekind is not to be deprived of his predelection for the minor key . He introduces the tragic tone in this instance right in the final scene , when von Keith is confronted by the dead body of his common-law wife , Molly Griefinger . In some respects this episode resembles a travesty upon the final act of Sudermann 's aEurooeSodoms Ende ; aEuro  but it is characteristic of Wedekind that he makes Molly kill herself because she fears von Keith 's success will estrange her from her husband , and that her suicide is followed directly by the failure of von Keith 's well-laid plans , just as they seemed about to mature . It is characteristic , also , that the crowd which denounces von Keith as the cause of Molly 's death , and which threatens to do him bodily harm , is composed of tradesmen whose initial cause of discontent is to be found in the promoter 's failure to pay his bills . Wedekind 's certainty of touch is as much in evidence in his handling of his minor characters as it is in the portrayal of von Keith . There is Molly , whose little bourgeois soul fears the great world , shrinks from her husband 's acquaintances , and dreads to take its place among the wealthy classes ; Simba , the artist 's model , who is astonished at anybody pitying her as a victim of civilization when she can get drunk on champagne ; Casimir , the wealthy merchant ; and the Bohemian painter Saranieff , with his friend Zamrjaki , the composer . As an antithesis to von Keith we are introduced to Ernst Scholz , a weakling whose soul is torn by internal strife , until its owner is at peace neither with himself nor the world . Scholz wastes his time seeking a reason for his own existence and in longing to become a useful member of society ; von Keith scorns to bother his brain with such trifles , boldly proclaiming the Nietzschean doctrine that the only way to be useful to others is to help one 's self as much as possible , and asserting that he would rather gather cigar stumps in the cafA ( C ) gutters than live in slothful peace in the country . There is no doubt about von Keith being a rogue , in the conventional acceptance of the term , but his enthusiasm appeals to us and we feel for him in his undoing at the end of the play . In aEurooeDie Junge WeltaEuro  Wedekind shows us the laughable attempts of a party of young girls to live a life of celibacy in pursuance of a resolution taken in boarding school . It is an amusing comedy , and contains , among other interesting personages , a literary man , who nearly drives his wife to divorce by his habit of jotting down notes of her emotions , even when he is kissing her . An opportunity to comment upon the German lese majesty is not neglected by Wedekind in the romantic drama , aEurooeSo ist das Leben , aEuro  a dignified and carefully wrought work , partly in verse , which deals with the tribulations of a deposed monarch in his own country . This exiled king becomes tramp , tailor and strolling player , to end eventually as court jester of the very man who has taken his place on the throne . aEurooeDer KammersA ¤ nger , aEuro  three scenes from the life of a popular tenor , is little more than a dramatic sketch . aEurooeDer ErdgeistaEuro  and aEurooeDie BA1 / 4chse der Pandora , aEuro  two plays which constitute an integral whole , deal with a lady who embraces Mrs. Warren 's profession . These , with aEurooeDer LeibestrankaEuro  and aEurooeOaha , aEuro  two farces , with traces of real psychology , round out the total of Wedekind 's dramatic works . In addition , he has indulged in verse-making and written a number of short stories somewhat in the manner of De Maupassant . One may feel at times that Wedekind 's art would gain by the exercise of more restraint , but there is no denying it is a great relief from aEurooelyric lemonade. aEuro  An attempt to explain symbolism is usually a dangerous matter . If a failure , it makes the one who essays the task ridiculous . If successful , it cheapens the value of the symbolism ; symbolism being a kind of an overtone to verbal reasoning , to which it bears much the same relationship as music does to poetry . In spite of this double danger , the translator ventures to close this review with a guess at the personality of the Masked Man who plays such an important part in the final scene of aEurooeFrA1 / 4hlings ErwachenaEuro  and to whom the author has dedicated the play . To the translator , then , this mysterious personage is none other than Life , Life in its reality , not Life as seen through the fogged glasses of Melchior 's pedagogues or the purblind eyes of the unfortunate mother who sends her daughter to an untimely grave .</performance>

     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>I 'd rather be a cab-horse than go to school !—— Why do we go to school ?—— We go to school so that somebody can examine us !—— And why do they examine us ?—— In order that we may fail . Seven must fail , because the upper classroom will hold only sixty .—— I feel so queer since Christmas .—— The devil take me , if it were not for Papa , I 'd pack my bundle and go to Altoona to-day !</p>

      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>Let 's talk of something else ——</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>They go for a walk .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>Do you see that black cat there with its tail sticking up ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>Do you believe in omens ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>I do n't know exactly . They come down to us . They do n't matter .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>I believe that is the Charybdis on which one runs when one steers clear of the Scylla of religious folly .—— Let 's sit down under this beech tree . The cool wind blows over the mountains . Now I should like to be a young dryad up there in the wood to cradle myself in the topmost branches and be rocked the livelong night .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>Unbutton your vest , Melchior .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>Ha !—— How clothes make one puff up !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>God knows , it 's growing so dark that one can n't see one 's hand before one 's eyes . Where are you ?—— Do you believe , Melchior , that the feeling of shame in man is only a product of his education ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>I was thinking over that for the first time the day before yesterday . It seems to me deeply rooted in human nature . Only think , you must appear entirely clothed before your best friend . You would n't do so if he did n't do the same thing .—— Therefore , it 's more or less of a fashion .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>I have often thought that if I have children , boys and girls , I will let them occupy the same room ; let them sleep together in the same bed , if possible ; let them help each other dress and undress night and morning . In hot weather , the boys as well as the girls , should wear nothing all day long but a short white woolen tunic with a girdle .—— It seems to me that if they grew up that way they would be easier in mind than we are under the present regulations .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>I believe so decidedly , Moritz !—— The only question is , suppose the girls have children , what then ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>How could they have children ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>In that respect I believe in instinct . I believe , for example , that if one brought up a male and a female cat together , and kept both separated from the outside world —— that is , left them entirely to their own devices —— that , sooner or later , the she cat would become pregnant , even if she , and the tom cat as well , had nobody to open their eyes by example .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>That might happen with animals ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>I believe the same of human beings . I assure you , Moritz , if your boys sleep in the same bed with the girls , and the first emotion of manhood comes unexpectedly to them — I should like to wager with anyone ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>You may be right — but after all ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>And when your girls reached the same age it would be the same with them ! Not that the girls exactly — one can n't judge that the same , certainly — at any rate , it is supposable — and then their curiosity must not be left out of account .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>A question , by the way ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>Well ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>But you will answer ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>Naturally !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>Truly ? !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>My hand on it .—— Now , Moritz ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>Have you written your composition yet ? ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>Speak right out from your heart !—— Nobody sees or hears us here .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>Of course , my children will have to work all day long in yard or garden , or find their amusement in games which are combined with physical exercise . They must ride , do gymnastics , climb , and , above all things , must not sleep as soft as we do . We are weakened frightfully .—— I believe one would not dream if one slept harder .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>From now until fall I shall sleep only in my hammock . I have shoved my bed back of the stove . It is a folding one . Last winter I dreamed once that I flogged our Lolo until he could n't move a limb . That was the most gruesome thing I ever dreamed .—— Why do you look at me so strangely ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>Have you experienced it yet ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>What ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>How do you say it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>Manhood 's emotion ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>M — ‘ hm .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>Certainly !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>I also —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— —— ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>I 've known that for a long while !—— Almost for a year .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>I was startled as if by lightning .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>Did you dream ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>Only for a little while — of legs in light blue tights , that strode over the teacher 's desk — to be correct , I thought they wanted to go over it . I only saw them for an instant .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>George Zirschnitz dreamed of his mother .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>Did he tell you that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>Out there on the gallow 's road .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>If you only knew what I have endured since that night !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>Qualms of conscience ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>Qualms of conscience ? ?—— The anguish of death !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>Good Lord ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>I thought I was incurable . I believed I was suffering from an inward hurt .—— Finally I became calm enough to begin to jot down the recollections of my life . Yes , yes , dear Melchior , the last three weeks have been a Gethsemane for me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>I was more or less prepared for it when it came . I felt a little ashamed of myself .—— But that was all .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>And yet you are a whole year younger than I am .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>I would n't bother about that , Moritz . All my experience shows that the appearance of this phantom belongs to no particular age . You know that big LA ¤ mmermeier with the straw-colored hair and the hooked nose . He is three years older than I am . Little Hans Rilow says LA ¤ mmermeier dreams now only of tarts and apricot preserves .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>But , I ask you , how can Hans Rilow know that ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>He asked him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>He asked him ?—— I did n't dare ask anybody .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>But you asked me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>God knows , yes !—— Possibly Hans , too , has made his will .—— Truly they play a remarkable game with us . And we 're expected to give thanks for it . I do n't remember to have had any longing for this kind of excitement . Why did n't they let me sleep peacefully until all was still again . My dear parents might have had a hundred better children . I came here , I do n't know how , and must be responsible because I did n't stay away .—— Have n't you often wondered , Melchior , by what means we were brought into this whirl ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>Do n't you know that yet either , Moritz ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>How should I know it ? I see how the hens lay eggs , and hear that Mamma had to carry me under her heart . But is that enough ?—— I remember , too , when I was a five year old child , to have been embarrassed when anyone turned up the dA<stage>C</stage>colletA<stage>C</stage>queen of hearts . This feeling has disappeared . At the same time , I can hardly talk with a girl to-day without thinking of something indecent , and — I swear to you , Melchior — I do n't know what .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>I will tell you everything . I have gotten it partly from books , partly from illustrations , partly from observations of nature . You will be surprised ; it made me an atheist . I told it to George Zirschnitz ! George Zirschnitz wanted to tell it to Hans Rilow , but Hans Rilow had learned it all from his governess when he was a child .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>I have gone through Meyer 's Little Encyclopedia from A to Z . Words — nothing but words and words ! Not a single plain explanation . Oh , this feeling of shame !—— What good to me is an encyclopedia that wo n't answer me concerning the most important question in life ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>Did you ever see two dogs running together about the streets ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>No !—— Do n't tell me anything to-day , Melchior . I have Central America and Louis the Fifteenth before me . And then the sixty verses of Homer , the seven equations and the Latin composition .—— I would fail in all of them again to-morrow . To drudge successfully I must be as stupid as an ox .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>Come with me to my room . In three-quarters of an hour I will have the Homer , the equations and two compositions . I will put one or two harmless errors in yours , and the thing is done . Mamma will make lemonade for us again , and we can chat comfortably about propagation .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>I can n't —— I can n't chat comfortably about propagation ! If you want to do me a favor , give me your information in writing . Write me out what you know . Write it as briefly and clearly as possible , and put it between my books to-morrow during recess . I will carry it home without knowing that I have it . I will find it unexpectedly . I cannot but help going over it with tired eyes —— in case it is hard to explain , you can use a marginal diagram or so .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>You are like a girl .—— Nevertheless , as you wish . It will be a very interesting task for me .—— One question , Moritz ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>Hm ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>Did you ever see a girl ?</p>

      <p>So have I !—— Then we wo n't need any illustrations .</p>

      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>During the SchA1 / 4tzenfest in Leilich 's anatomical museum ! If it had leaked out I should have been hunted out of school .—— Beautiful as the light of day , and —— oh , so true to nature !</p>

      <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
      <p>No . Only when there is special occasion .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>What do they beat you with , Martha ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
      <p>Oh , with anything that is handy .—— Does your mother think it 's naughty to eat a piece of bread in bed ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>No ! no !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
      <p>I believe they enjoy it —— even if they do n't say so . If I ever have children I will let them grow up like the weeds in our flower garden . Nobody worries about them and they grow so high and thick —— while the roses in the beds grow poorer and poorer every summer .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THEA</speaker>
      <p>If I have children I shall dress them all in pink . Pink hats , pink dresses , pink shoes . Only the stockings —— the stockings shall be black as night ! When I go for a walk they shall march in front of me .—— And you , Wendla ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>How do you know that you will have any ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THEA</speaker>
      <p>Why should n't we have any ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
      <p>Well , Aunt Euphemia has n't any .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THEA</speaker>
      <p>You goose , that 's because she is n't married .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>Aunt Bauer was married three times and she did n't have a single one .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
      <p>If you have any , Wendla , which would you rather have , boys or girls ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>Boys ! boys !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THEA</speaker>
      <p>I , too , boys !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
      <p>So would I . Better twenty boys than three girls .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THEA</speaker>
      <p>Girls are tiresome .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
      <p>If I were n't a girl already I certainly would n't want to be one .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>That 's a matter of taste , I believe , Martha . I rejoice every day that I am a girl . Believe me , I would n't change places with a king 's son .—— That 's the reason why I only want boys !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THEA</speaker>
      <p>But that 's crazy , pure craziness , Wendla !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>But it must be a thousand times more exciting to be loved by a man than by a girl !</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>THEA</speaker>

       <l>But you do n't want to assert that Forest Inspector PfA ¤ lle loves</l>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>That I do , Thea . PfA ¤ lle is proud . PfA ¤ lle is proud because he is a forest inspector — for PfA ¤ lle has nothing .—— Melitta is happy because she gets ten thousand times more than she is .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
      <p>Are n't you proud of yourself , Wendla ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>That would be silly .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MARTHA</speaker>
      <p>In your place I should be proud of my appearance .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THEA</speaker>
      <p>Only look how she steps out —— how free her glance is — how she holds herself , Martha . Is n't that pride ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>Why not ? I am so happy to be a girl ; if I were n't a girl I should break down the next time ——</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>THEA</speaker>
      <p>He disgraces anybody who is with him . At Rilow 's party he offered me some bon-bons . Only think , Wendla , they were soft and warm . Is n't that ——? He said he had kept them too long in his trouser 's pocket .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>

      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>You do n't know , Hans , you can n't guess , what depends on it . For three weeks I 've slunk past that door as if it were a hellish abyss . To-day I saw it was ajar . I believe that if some one had offered me a million —— nothing , oh nothing , could have held me .—— I stood in the middle of the room ,— I opened the report book —— ran over the leaves —— found —— and during all that time —— I shudder ——</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>I 'm hunting waldmeister .<stage>1</stage>Mamma wants to make Maybowl . At first she intended coming along herself , but at the last moment Aunt Bauer dropped in , and she does n't like to climb .—— So I came by myself .</p>

      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>Have you found your waldmeister ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>A whole basketful . Down there under the beach it grows as thick as meadow clover . Just now I am looking for a way out . I seem to have lost the path . Can you tell me what time it is ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>Just a little after half-past four . When do they expect you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>I thought it was later . I lay dreaming for a long time on the moss by the brook . The time went by so fast , I feared it was already evening .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>If nobody is waiting for you , let us linger here a little longer . Under the oak tree there is my favorite place . If one leans one 's head back against the trunk and looks up through the branches at the sky , one becomes hypnotized . The ground is warm yet from the morning sun .—— For weeks I 've been wanting to ask you something , Wendla .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>But I must be home at five o'clock .</p>

      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>We 'll go together , then . I 'll take the basket and we 'll beat our way through the bushes , so that in ten minutes we 'll be on the bridge !—— When one lies so , with one 's head in one 's hand , one has the strangest thoughts .——</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Both lie down under the oak .</stage>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>What do you want to ask me , Melchior ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>I 've heard , Wendla , that you visit poor people 's houses . You take them food and clothes and money also . Do you do that of your own free will , or does your mother send you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>Mother sends me mostly . They are families of day laborers that have too many children . Often the husband can n't find work and then they freeze and go hungry . We have a lot of things which were laid away long ago in our closets and wardrobes and which are no longer needed .—— But how did you know it ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>Do you go willingly or unwillingly , when your mother sends you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>Oh , I love to go !—— How can you ask ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>But the children are dirty , the women are sick , the houses are full of filth , the men hate you because you do n't work ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>That 's not true , Melchior . And if it were true , I 'd go just the same !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>Why just the same , Wendla ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>I 'd go just the same ! It would make me all the happier to be able to help them .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>Then you go to see the poor because it makes you happy ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>I go to them because they are poor .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>But if it were n't a pleasure to you , you would n't go ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>Can I help it that it makes me happy ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>And because of it you expect to go to heaven ! So it 's true , then , that which has given me no peace for a month past !— Can the covetous man help it that it is no pleasure to him to go to see dirty sick children ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>Oh , surely it would give you the greatest pleasure !</p>

      <p>And , therefore , he must suffer everlasting death . I 'll write a paper on it and send it to Pastor Kahlbauch . He is the cause of it . Why did he fool us with the joy of good works .— If he can n't answer me I wo n't go to Sunday-school any longer and wo n't let them confirm me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>Why do n't you tell your trouble to your dear parents ? Let yourself be confirmed , it wo n't cost you your head . If it were n't for our horrid white dresses and your long trousers one might be more spiritual .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>There is no sacrifice ! There is no self-denial ! I see the good rejoice in their hearts , I see the evil tremble and groan — I see you , Wendla Bergmann , shake your locks and laugh while I am as melancholy as an outlaw .— What did you dream , Wendla , when you lay in the grass by the brook ?</p>

      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>I dreamed I was a poor , poor beggar girl , who was turned out in the street at five o'clock in the morning . I had to beg the whole long day in storm and bad weather from rough , hard-hearted people . When I came home at night , shivering from hunger and cold , and without as much money as my father coveted , then I was beaten —— beaten ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>I know that , Wendla . You have the silly children 's stories to thank for that . Believe me , such brutal men exist no longer .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>Oh yes , Melchior , you 're mistaken . Martha Bessel is beaten night after night , so that one sees the marks of it the next day . Oh , but it must hurt ! It makes one boiling hot when she tells it . I 'm so frightfully sorry for her that I often cry over it in my pillows at night . For months I 've been thinking how one can help her .—— I 'd take her place for eight days with pleasure .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>One should complain of her father at once . Then the child would be taken away from him .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>I , Melchior , have never been beaten in my life —— not a single time . I can hardly imagine what it means to be beaten . I have beaten myself in order to see how one felt then in one 's heart —— It must be a gruesome feeling .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>I do n't believe a child is better for it .</p>

     <stage>He throws the switch aside and beats her with his fists so that she breaks out with a frightful cry . He pays no attention to this , but falls upon her as if he were crazy , while the tears stream heavily down his cheeks . Presently he springs away , holds both hands to his temples and rushes into the depths of the wood crying out in anguish of soul .</stage>

      <stage>Evening in Melchior 's study . The window is open , a lamp burns on the table .— Melchior and Moritz on the divan .</stage>

      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>Now I 'm quite gay again , only a little bit excited .—— But during the Greek lesson I slept like the besotted Polyphemus . I 'm astonished that the pronunciation of the ancient tongue does n't give me the earache .—— To-day I was within a hair of being late —— My first thought on waking was of the verbs in I1 / 4I¹ —— Himmel — Herrgott — Teufel — Donnerwetter , during breakfast and all along the road I conjugated until I saw green .—— I must have popped off to sleep shortly after three . My pen made a blot in the book . The lamp was smoking when Mathilde woke me ; the blackbirds in the elder bushes under the window were chirping so happily —— and I felt so inexpressibly melancholy . I put on my collar and passed the brush through my hair .—— One feels it when one imposes upon nature .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>May I roll you a cigarette ?</p>

      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>Thanks , I do n't smoke .—— If it only keeps on this way ! I will work and work until my eyes fall out of my head .—— Ernest RA ¶ bel has failed three times since vacation ; three times in Greek , twice with Knochenbruch ; the last time in the history of literature . I have been first five times in this lamentable conflict , and from to-day it does not bother me !—— RA ¶ bel will not shoot himself . RA ¶ bel has no parents who sacrifice everything for him . If he wants he can become a soldier , a cowboy or a sailor . If I fail , my father will feel the blow and Mamma will land in the madhouse . One can n't live through a thing like that !—— Before the examination I begged God to give me consumption that the cup might pass me by untouched . He passed me by , though to-day His aureole shines in the distance , so that I dare not lift my eyes by night or day .—— Now that I have grasped the bar I shall swing up on it . The natural consequence will be that I shall break my neck if I fall .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>Life is a worthless commonplace . It would n't have been a bad idea if I had hanged myself in the cradle .—— Why does n't Mamma come with the tea !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>Your tea will do me good , Melchior !—— I 'm shivering . I feel so strangely spiritualized . Touch me once , please . I see ,— I hear ,— I feel , much more acutely —— and yet everything seems like a dream —— oh , so harmonious .—— How still the garden stretches out there in the moonlight , so still , so deep , as if it extended to eternity . From out the bushes step indefinable figures that slip away in breathless officiousness through the clearings and then vanish in the twilight . It seems to me as if a counsel were to be held under the chestnut tree .—— Shall we go down there , Melchior ?</p>
     </sp>

      <p>Let 's wait until we have drunk our tea .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>The leaves whisper so busily .—— It 's just as if I heard my dead grandmother telling me the story of the aEurooeQueen Without a Head. aEuro  There was once a wonderfully beautiful Queen , beautiful as the sun , more beautiful than all the maidens in the country . Only , unfortunately , she came into the world without a head . She could not eat , not drink , not kiss . She could only communicate with her courtiers by using her soft little hand . With her dainty feet she stamped declarations of war and orders for executions . Then , one day , she was besieged by a King , who , by chance , had two heads , which , year in and year out , disputed with one another so violently that neither could get a word in edgewise . The Court Conjurer-in-chief took off the smallest of these heads and set it upon the Queen 's body . And , behold , it became her extraordinarily well ! Therefore , the King and the Queen were married , and the two heads disputed no longer , but kissed each other upon the brow , the cheeks and the mouth , and lived thereafter through long , long years of joy and peace .—— Delectable nonsense ! Since vacation I can n't get the headless Queen out of my mind . When I see a pretty girl , I see her without a head —— and then presently , I , myself appear to be the headless Queen .—— It is possible that someone may be set over me yet .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>It 's not worth mentioning . I went to bed somewhat too late last night .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>Only think , he worked all through the night .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRAU GABOR</speaker>
      <p>You should n't do such things , Herr Stiefel . You ought to take care of yourself . Think of your health . Do n't set your school above your health . Take plenty of walks in the fresh air . At your age , that is more important than a correct use of middle high German .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>I will go walking . You are right . One can be industrious while one is taking a walk . Why did n't I think of that myself !—— The written work I shall still have to do at home .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>You can do your writing here ; that will make it easier for both of us .—— You know , Mamma , that Max von Trenk has been down with brain fever !—— To-day at noon Hans Rilow came from von Trenk 's deathbed to announce to Rector Sonnenstich that von Trenk had just died in his presence . aEurooeIndeed ? aEuro  said Sonnenstich , aEurooehave n't you two hours from last week to make up ? Here is the beadle 's report . See that the matter is cleared up once for all ! The whole class will attend the burial. aEuro —— Hans was struck dumb .</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRAU GABOR</speaker>
      <p>Because you can n't understand it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>You can n't know that , Mamma . I feel very well that I am not yet able to grasp the work in its entirety ——</p>

      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>We always read together ; that helps our understanding wonderfully .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>FRAU GABOR</speaker>
      <p>You are old enough , Melchior , to be able to know what is good and what is bad for you . Do what you think best for yourself . I should be the first to acknowledge your right in this respect , because you have never given me a reason to have to deny you anything . I only want to warn you that even the best can do one harm when one is n't ripe enough in years to receive it properly .—— I would rather put my trust in you than in conventional educational methods .—— If you need anything , children , you , Melchior , come up and call me . I shall be in my bedroom .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>Were n't we discussing it just a moment ago !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>Faust himself cannot have deserted her in cold blood !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>The masterpiece does not end with this infamous action !—— Faust might have promised the maiden marriage , he might have forsaken her afterwards , but in my eyes he would have been not a hair less worthy of punishment . Gretchen might have died of a broken heart for all I care .—— One sees how this attracts the eyes continually ; one might think that the whole world turned on sex !<stage>2</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>To be frank with you , Melchior , I have almost the same feeling since I read your explanation .—— It fell at my feet during the first vacation days . I was startled . I fastened the door and flew through the flaming lines as a frightened owl flies through a burning wood —— I believe I read most of it with my eyes shut . Your explanation brought up a host of dim recollections , which affected me as a song of his childhood affects a man on his deathbed when heard from the lips of another . I felt the most vehement pity over what you wrote about maidens . I shall never lose that sensation . Believe me , Melchior , to suffer a wrong is sweeter than to do a wrong . To be overcome by such a sweet wrong and still be blameless seems to me the fullness of earthly bliss .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>I do n't want my bliss as alms !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>But why not ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>I do n't want anything for which I do n't have to fight !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>Is it enjoyable then , Melchior ?—— The maiden 's enjoyment is as that of the holy gods . The maiden controls herself , thanks to her self-denial . She keeps herself free from every bitterness until the last moment , in order that she may see the heavens open over her in an instant . The maiden fears hell even at the moment that she perceives a blooming paradise . Her feeling is as pure as a mountain spring . The maiden holds a cup over which no earthly breath has blown as yet ; a nectar chalice , the contents of which is spilled when it flames and flares .—— The enjoyment that the man finds in that , I think , is insipid and flat .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>You can think what you like about it , but keep your thoughts to yourself —— I do n't like to think about it .</p>

Wilt thou not visit me for awhile in my dreams ? I will receive thee with widely open arms and will kiss thee until thou art breathless . Thou drawest me onward as the enchanted princess in her deserted castle . Portals and doors open themselves as if by an unseen hand , while the fountain in the park below begins to splash joyously —— aEurooeIt is the cause !—— It is the cause ! aEuro  The frightful beating in my breast shows thee that I do not murder thee from frivolous emotion . The thought of my lonely nights is strangling me . I swear to thee , child , on my soul , that it is not satiety which rules me . Who could ever boast of being satiated of thee ! But thou suckest the marrow from my bones , thou bendest my back , thou robbest my youthful eyes of their last spark of brilliancy .—— Thou art so arrogant toward me in thy inhuman modesty , so galling with thy immovable limbs !—— Thou or I ! And I have won the victory . Suppose I count them —— all those who sleep , with whom I have fought the same battle here ——: Psyche by Thumann — another bequest from the spindle-shanked Mademoiselle Angelique , that rattlesnake in the paradise of my childhood ; Io by Corregio ; Galathea by Lossow ; then a Cupid by Bouguereau ; Ada by J. van Beers — that Ada whom I had to abduct from a secret drawer in Papa 's secretary in order to incorporate in my harem ; a trembling , modest Leda by Makart , whom I found by chance among my brother 's college books —— seven , thou blooming candidate for death , have preceded thee upon this path to Tartarus . Let that be a consolation unto thee , and seek not to increase my torments at this enormity by that fleeting look . Thou diest not for thy sins , thou diest on account of mine !—— As protection against myself I go to my seventh wife-murder with a bleeding heart . There is something tragic in the rA'le of Bluebeard . I believe the combined sufferings of his murdered wives did not equal the torments he underwent each time he strangled one of them . But my thoughts will become more peaceful , my body will strengthen itself , when thou , thou little devil , residest no longer in the red satin padding of my jewel case . In place of thee , I will indulge in wanton joyousness with Bodenhausen 's Lurlei or Linger 's Forsaken One , or Defregger 's Loni — so I should be all the quicker ! But a quarter of a year more , perhaps thy unveiled charms , sweet soul , would begin to consume my poor head as the sun does a pat of butter . It is high time to declare the divorce from bed and board . Brrr ! I feel a Heliogablus within me ? Moritura me salutat ! Maiden , maiden , why dost thou press thy knees together ?—— Why now of all times ?—— In face of the inscrutable eternity ?—— A movement and I will spare thy life !—— A womanly emotion , a sign of passion , of sympathy , maiden !—— I will frame thee in gold , and hang thee over my bed ! Doest thou not guess that only thy chastity begets my debauchery ?—— Woe , woe , unto the inhuman ones !—— One always perceives that they received an exemplary education —— It is just so with me . aEurooeHave you prayed to-night , Desdemona ? aEuro  My heart contracts ,—— madness !—— St . Agnes also died for her reserve and was not half as naked as thou !—— Another kiss upon thy blooming body —— upon thy childish swelling breast — upon thy sweetly rounded — thy cruel knees —— aEurooeIt is the cause , it is the cause , my soul , Let me not name it to you , you chaste stars !

      <speaker>FRAU GABOR</speaker>
      <p><stage>Sits writing .</stage>Dear Herr Stiefel :— After twenty-four hours of consideration and reconsideration of all you have written me , I take up my pen with a heavy heart . I cannot furnish you with the necessary amount for the voyage to America — I give you my word of honor . In the first place , I have not that much to my credit , and in the second place , if I had , it would be the greatest sin imaginable for me to put into your hands the means of accomplishing such an ill-considered measure . You will be doing me a bitter wrong , Herr Stiefel , if you see a sign of lack of love in my refusal . On the contrary , it would be the greatest neglect of my duty as your motherly friend were I to allow myself to be affected by your temporary lack of determination , so that I also lost my head and blindly followed my first fleeting impulse . I am very ready — in case you desire it — to write to your parents . I should seek to convince your parents that you have done what you could during this quarter , that you have exhausted your strength , that a rigorous judgment of your case would not only be inadvisable , but might be in the greatest degree prejudicial to your mental and bodily health . That you imply a threat to take your own life in case flight is impossible for you , to speak plainly , has somewhat surprised me . No matter how undeserving is a misfortune , Herr Stiefel , one should never choose improper means to escape it . The way in which you , to whom I have always done only good , want to make me responsible for a possible frightful action on your part , has something about it which , in the eyes of an evil-thinking person , might be misconstrued very easily . I must confess that this outbreak of yours — you who know so well what one owes to oneself — is the last thing for which I was prepared . However , I cherish the strong conviction that you are laboring yet too much under the shock of your first fright to be able to understand completely your action . And , therefore , I hope with confidence that these words of mine will find you already in better spirits . Take up the matter as it stands . In my opinion it is unwise to judge a young man by his school record . We have too many examples of bad students becoming distinguished men , and , on the other hand , of brilliant students not being at all remarkable in life . At any rate , I can assure you that your misfortune , as far as it lies with me , shall make no difference in your association with Melchior . On the contrary , it will afford me the greatest pleasure to see my son going with a young man who , let the world judge him as it will , is able to win my fullest sympathy . And , therefore , hold your head high , Herr Stiefel !—— Such a crisis as this comes to all of us and will soon be surmounted . If all of us had recourse to dagger or poison in such cases , there would soon be no men left in the world . Let me hear from you right soon again , and accept the heartfelt greetings of your unchanged Motherly friend ,</p>

At the same time , the worst must fall upon them . They were old enough to know what they were doing . I was a weakling when I came into the world —— or else I would have been wise enough to become another being . Why should I be forced to pay for the fact that the others were here already ! I must have fallen on my head —— If anybody makes me a present of a mad dog I 'll give him back a mad dog . And if he wo n't take back his mad dog , then I am human and —— I must have fallen on my head ! Man is born by chance and should not , after mature consideration —— It is to shoot oneself dead ! The weather at least has shown itself considerate . The whole day it looked like rain and yet it has held off .—— A rare peace rules in nature . Nowhere anything dazzling , exciting . Heaven and earth are like a transparent fabric . And everything seems so happy . The landscape is as sweet as the melody of a lullaby .—— aEurooeSleep , little prince , sleep on , aEuro  as FrA ¤ ulein Snandulia sang .

Snandulia only dances with good matches .—— Her silk dress was cut low in front and in the back . In the back , down to her girdle and in the front down —— unconscionably low .—— She could n't have worn a chemise .——— That might be something able to affect me yet .—— More than half curiosity .—— It must be a wonderful sensation —— a feeling as if one were being carried through the rapids —— I should never tell anybody that I was experiencing something untried before —— I would act as if I had done it all .— There is something shameful in growing up to be a man without having learned the chief function of masculinity .—— You come from Egypt , honorable sir , and have not seen the pyramids ? ! I will not cry again to-day . I will not think of my burial again .—— Melchior will lay a wreath on my coffin . Pastor Kahlbauch will console my parents . Rector Sonnenstich will cite examples from history .—— It is possible that I shall not have a tombstone . I had wanted a snow-white marble urn on a pedestal of black syenite .—— Thank God , I shall not miss them . Monuments are for the living , not for the dead . I should need a whole year to say farewell to everything in my thoughts . I will not cry again . I am so happy to be able to look back without bitterness . How many beautiful evenings I have passed with Melchior !—— under the osiers ; at the forester 's house ; on the highway where the five lindens stand ; on the Schlossberg , among the restful ruins of the Runenburg .—— When the hour comes , I will think with all my might of whipped cream . Whipped cream does n't stay firm . It falls and leaves a pleasant after-taste .—— I had thought men were infinitely worse . I have n't found one who did n't want to do his best . Many have suffered with me on my own account . I wander to the altar like the ancient Etrurian youth whose dying rattle bought his brothers ’ prosperity for the coming year .—— I experience bit by bit the mysterious awe of liberation . I sob with sorrow over my lot .—— Life has turned its cold shoulder to me . I see earnest , friendly glances luring me there in the distance , the headless queen , the headless queen — compassion awaiting me with open arms —— Your commands concern minors ; I carry my free ticket in myself . If the shell sinks , the butterfly flits from it ; the delusion no longer holds .—— You should drive no mad bargain with the swindle ! The mists close in ; life is bitter on the tongue .</p>

I was so drunk they had to put me to bed .—— Do you go to school yet , Moritz ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>No , no ,—— I take my leave of it this quarter .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ILSE</speaker>
      <p>You are right . Ah , how time passes when one earns money !—— Do you remember how we used to play robbers ?—— Wendla Bergmann and you and I and the others , when you used to come out in the evening and drink warm goat 's milk at our house ?—— What is Wendla doing ? I have n't seen her since the flood —— What is Melchi Gabor doing ?—— Does he seem as deep thinking as ever ?—— We used to stand opposite each other during singing .</p>

      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>He philosophizes .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ILSE</speaker>
      <p>Wendla came to see us a while ago and brought Mother some presents . I sat that day for Isidor Landauer . He needed me for the Holy Mary , the Mother of God , with the Christ Child . He is a ninny and disagreeable . Hu , like a weathercock !—— Have you a katzenjammer ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>From last night !—— We soaked like hippopotami . I staggered home at five o'clock .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ILSE</speaker>
      <p>One need only to look at you .—— Were there any girls there ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>Arabella , the beer nymph , an Andalusian . The landlord let all of us spend the whole night alone with her .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ILSE</speaker>
      <p>One only need look at you , Moritz !—— I do n't know what a katzenjammer 's like . During the last carnival I went three days and three nights without going to bed or taking my clothes off . From the ball to the cafA<stage>C</stage>, noon at Bellavista ; evenings , Tingle-Tangle ; night , to the ball . Lena was there , and the fat Viola .—— The third night Heinrich found me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>Had he been looking for you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ILSE</speaker>
      <p>He tripped over my arm . I lay senseless in the snow in the street .—— That 's how I went with him . For fourteen days I did n't leave his lodgings —— a dreadful time ! In the morning I had to throw on his Persian nightgown and in the evening go about the room in the black costume of a page ; white lace ruffles at my neck , my knees and my wrists . Every day he photographed me in some new arrangement —— once on the sofa as Ariadne , once as Leda , once as Ganymede , once on all fours as a feminine Nebuchadnezzar . Then he longed for murder , for shooting , suicide and coal gas . Early in the morning he brought a pistol into bed , loaded it full of shot and put it against my breast ! A twitch and I 'll pull !—— Oh , he would have fired , Moritz , he would have fired !—— Then he put the thing in his mouth like a blow-pipe .—— That awoke the feeling of self-preservation . And then —— brrr !—— the shot might have gone through my spine .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>Is Heinrich living yet ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ILSE</speaker>
      <p>How do I know !—— Over the bed was a large mirror set into the ceiling . The room seemed as high as a tower and as bright as an opera house . One saw one 's self hanging down bodily from heaven . I had frightful dreams at night —— O God , O God , if it were only day !—— Good-night , Ilse , when you are asleep you will be pretty to murder !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>Is this Heinrich living yet ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ILSE</speaker>
      <p>Please God , no !—— One day , when he went for absinthe , I put on the mantle and ran out into the street . The carnival was over ; the police arrested me ; what was I doing in man 's clothes ?—— They took me to the Central Station . Nohl , Fehrendorf , Padinsky , SpA1 / 4hler , Oikonomopulos , the whole Priapia came there and bailed me out . They transported me in a cab to Adolar 's studio . Since then I 've been true to the herd . Fehrendorf is an ape , Nohl is a pig , Bojokewitsch an owl , Loison a hyena , Oikonomopulos a camel —— therefore I love one and all of them the same and would n't attach myself to anyone else , even if the world were full of archangels and millionaires !</p>

      <speaker>ILSE</speaker>
      <p>To drink warm goat 's milk ! I will singe your hair and hang a little bell around your neck .—— Then we have another kid with which you can play .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>I must go back . I have yet the Sassanides , the Sermon on the Mount and the parallelepipedon on my thoughts .—— Good-night , Ilse !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ILSE</speaker>
      <p>Sleep well !—— Do you ever go to the wigwam where Melchi Gabor buried my tomahawk ?—— Brrr ! until you are married I 'll lie in the straw .</p>

I would laugh when the talk turned on passion —— I would cry out !—— Cry out !—— Cry out ! It is you , Ilse !—— Priapia !—— Loss of memory !—— That takes my strength !—— This child of fortune , this sunny child —— this joyous maiden on my dolorous path !—— O !—— O !——— —— —— —— ——<stage>In the bushes by the bank .</stage>Have I found it again unwillingly — the seat of turf . The mulleins seem to have grown since yesterday . The outlook between the willows is still the same —— The water runs as heavy as melted lead . I must n't forget .<stage>He takes Frau Gabor 's letter from his pocket and burns it .</stage>—— How the sparks fly — here and there , downward and upward —— souls !—— shooting stars ! Before I struck a light one could see the grass and a streak on the horizon .—— Now it is dark . Now I shall never return home again .</p>

      <p>Has any gentleman something further to remark ?—— Gentlemen ! We cannot help moving the expulsion of our guilty pupil before the National Board of Education ; there are the strongest reasons why we cannot : We cannot , because we must expiate the misfortune which has fallen upon us already ; we cannot , because of our need to protect ourselves from similar blows in the future ; we cannot , because we must chastise our guilty pupil for the demoralizing influence he exerted upon his classmates ; we cannot , above all , because we must hinder him from exerting the same influence upon his remaining classmates . We cannot ignore the charge — and this , gentlemen , is possibly the weightiest of all —— on any pretext concerning a ruined career , because it is our duty to protect ourselves from an epidemic of suicide similar to that which has broken out recently in various grammar schools , and which until to-day has mocked all attempts of the teachers to shackle it by any means known to advanced education —— Has any gentleman something further to remark ?</p>

      <p>Leave that window shut likewise ! I , for my part , am of the opinion that the air here leaves nothing to be desired !—— Has any gentleman anything further to remark ?—— Let us suppose that we omitted to move the expulsion of our guilty pupil before the National Board of Education , then the National Board of Education would hold us responsible for the misfortune which has overwhelmed us . Of the various grammar schools visited by the epidemic of self-murder , those in which the devastation of self-murder has reached 25 per cent . have been closed by the National Board of Education . It is our duty , as the guardians and protectors of our institute , to protect our institute from this staggering blow . It grieves us deeply , gentlemen , that we are not in a position to consider the other qualifications of our guilt-laden pupil as mitigating circumstances . An indulgent treatment , which would allow our guilty pupil to be vindicated , would not in any conceivable way imaginable vindicate the present imperiled existence of our institute . We see ourselves under the necessity of judging the guilt-laden that we may not be judged guilty ourselves .—— Habebald !</p>

      <p>Come nearer to the table !—— After Herr Stiefel became aware of the profligate deed of his son , the distracted father searched the remaining effects of his son Moritz , hoping if possible , to find the cause of the abominable deed , and discovered among them , in an unexpected place , a manuscript , which , while it did not make us understand the abominable deed , threw an unfortunate and sufficient light upon the moral disorder of the criminal . This manuscript , in the form of a dialogue entitled aEurooeThe Nuptial Sleep , aEuro  illustrated with life-size pictures full of shameless obscenity , has twenty pages of long explanations that seek to satisfy every claim a profligate imagination can make upon a lewd book .——</p>

      <speaker>FRAU GABOR</speaker>
      <p>They needed a scapegoat . They did not dare meet the charge that was made everywhere against themselves . And now that my child has had the misfortune to run his head into the noose at the right moment , shall I , his own mother , help to end the work of his executioners ?—— God keep me from it !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HERR GABOR</speaker>
      <p>For fourteen years I have looked on at your spirited educational methods in silence . They were contrary to my ideas . I had always lived in the conviction that a child was not a plaything ; a child should have a claim upon our most earnest efforts . But , I said to myself , if the spirit and the grace of the one parent are able to compensate for the serious maxims of the other , they may be given preference over the serious maxims .—— I am not reproaching you , Fanny , but do n't stand in my way when I seek to right your injustice and mine toward the lad .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRAU GABOR</speaker>
      <p>I will block the way for you as long as a warm drop of blood beats in me . My child would be lost in the House of Correction . A criminal nature might be bettered in such an institution . I do n't know . A fine natured man would just as surely turn into a criminal , like the plants when they are kept from sun and light . I am conscious of no injustice on my part . To-day , as always , I thank heaven that it showed me the way to awaken righteousness of character and nobility of thought in my child . What has he done which is so frightful ? It does n't occur to me to apologize for him —— now that they have hunted him out of school , he bears no fault ! And if it was his fault he has paid for it . You may know better . You may be entirely right theoretically . But I cannot allow my only child to be forcibly hunted to death .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HERR GABOR</speaker>
      <p>That does n't depend on us , Fanny . That is the risk we took with our happiness . He who is too weak to march stops by the wayside . And , in the end , it is not the worst when what was certain to come comes in time to be bettered . Heaven protect us from that ! It is our duty to strengthen the loiterer as long as reason supplies a means .—— That they have hunted him out of school is not his own fault . If they had n't hunted him out of school , that would n't have been his fault , either !—— You are so lighthearted . You perceive inconsiderable trifles when the question concerns a fundamental injury to character . You women are not accustomed to judge such things . Anyone who can write what Melchior wrote must be rotten to the core of his being . The mark is plain . A half-healthy nature would n't do such a thing . None of us are saints . Each of us wanders from the straight path . His writing , on the contrary , tramples on principle . His writing is no evidence of a chance slip in the usual way ; it sets forth with dreadful plainness and a frankly definite purpose that natural longing , that propensity for immorality , because it is immorality . His writing manifests that exceptional state of spiritual corruption which we jurists classify under the term aEurooemoral imbecility. aEuro —— If anything can be done in his case , I am not able to say . If we want to preserve a glimmer of hope , and keep our spotless consciences as the parents of the victim , it is time for us to go to work determinedly in earnest .— Do n't let us contend any more , Fanny ! I feel how hard it is for you . I know that you idolize him because he expresses so entirely your genial nature . Be stronger than yourself . Show yourself for once devoid of self-interest towards your son .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRAU GABOR</speaker>
      <p>God help me , how can one get along that way ! One must be a man to be able to talk that way ! One must be a man to be able to blind oneself so with the dead letter ! One must be a man to be so blind that one can n't see what stares him in the eyes . I have conscientiously and thoughtfully managed Melchior from his first day , because I found him impressionable to his surroundings . Are we answerable for what has happened ? A tile might fall off the roof upon your head to-morrow , and then comes your friend — your father , and , instead of taking care of you , tramples upon you !—— I will not let my child be destroyed before my eyes . That 's the reason I 'm his mother .—— It is inconceivable ! It is not to be believed ! What did he write , then , after all ! Is n't it the most striking proof of his harmlessness , of his stupidity , of his childish obscurity , that he can write so !—— One must possess no intuitive knowledge of mankind —— one must be an out and out bureaucrat , or weak in intellect , to scent moral corruption here !—— Say what you will . If you land Melchior in the House of Correction , I will get a divorce . Then let me see if I can n't find help and means somewhere in the world to rescue my child from destruction .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HERR GABOR</speaker>
      <p>You must prepare yourself for it —— if not to-day , then to-morrow . It is not easy for anyone to discount misfortune . I will stand beside you , and when your courage begins to fail will spare no trouble or effort to relieve your heart . The future seems so gray to me , so full of clouds —— it only remains for you to leave me too .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRAU GABOR</speaker>
      <p>I should never see him again : I should never see him again ! He can n't bear the vulgar . He will not be able to stand the dirt . He will break under restraint ; the most frightful examples will be before his eyes !—— And if I see him again —— O , God , O , God , that joyous heart —— his clear laughter —— all , all ,—— his childish resolution to fight courageously for good and righteousness —— oh , this morning sky , how I cherished it light and pure in his soul as my highest good —— Hold me to account if the sin cries for expiation ! Hold me to account ! Do with me what you will ! I will bear the guilt .—— But keep your frightful hand off the boy .</p>

      <p>He has not gone wrong !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HERR GABOR</speaker>
      <p>He has gone wrong !—— I would have given everything to be able to spare your boundless love .—— A terrified woman came to me this morning , scarcely able to control her speech , with this letter in her hand —— a letter to her fifteen-year-old daughter . She had opened it simply out of curiosity ; the girl was not at home .—— In the letter Melchior explains to the fifteen-year-old girl that his manner of acting left him no peace , that he had sinned against her , etc ., etc ., and that naturally he would answer for it . She must not fret herself even if she felt results . He was already on the road after help ; his expulsion made it easier for him . The previous false step could still lead to her happiness —— and more of such irrational nonsense .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRAU GABOR</speaker>
      <p>Impossible !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HERR GABOR</speaker>
      <p>The letter is forged . It 's a cheat . Somebody is trying to take advantage of his generally known expulsion . I have not yet spoken to the lad about it —— but please look at this hand ! See the writing !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRAU GABOR</speaker>
      <p>An unprecedented , shameless bit of knavery !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HERR GABOR</speaker>
      <p>That 's what I 'm afraid !</p>
     </sp>

      <speaker>FRAU GABOR</speaker>
      <p>No , no —— never , never !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HERR GABOR</speaker>
      <p>It would be so much the better for us .—— The woman , wringing her hands , asked me what she should do . I told her she should not leave her fifteen-year-old daughter lying about a haymow . Fortunately she left me the letter .—— If we send Melchior to another grammar school , where he is not under parental supervision , in three weeks we shall have the same result .—— A new expulsion —— his joyful heart will get used to it after awhile .—— Tell me , Fanny , where shall I send the lad ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRAU GABOR</speaker>
      <p>To the House of Correction ——</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>FRAU GABOR</speaker>
      <p>House of Correction !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HERR GABOR</speaker>
      <p>He will find there , in the first place , that which has been wrongfully withheld from him at home , parental discipline , principles , and a moral constraint to which he must submit under all circumstances .—— Moreover , the House of Correction is not a place of terror , as you think it . The greatest weight is laid in the establishment upon the development of Christian thought and sensibility . The lad will learn at last to follow good in place of desire and not to follow his natural instincts , but to observe the letter of the law .—— A half hour ago I received a telegram from my brother that confirms the woman 's statement . Melchior has confided in him and begged him for 200 marks in order to fly to England ——</p>

      <speaker>DR . VON BRAUSEPULVER</speaker>
      <p>How old are you , exactly ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>Fourteen and a half .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>DR . VON BRAUSEPULVER</speaker>
      <p>I have been ordering Blaud 's pills for fifteen years and have noticed astonishing results in the majority of cases . I prefer them to cod liver oil and wine of iron . Begin with three or four pills a day , and increase the number just as soon as you are able . I ordered FrA ¤ ulein Elfriede , Baroness von Witzleben to increase the number of them by one , every third day . The Baroness misunderstood me and increased the number every day by three . Scarcely three weeks later the Baroness was able to go to Pyrmont with her mother to complete her cure .—— I will allow you to dispense with exhausting walks and extra meals ; therefore , promise me , dear child , to take frequent exercise and to avoid unwholesome food as soon as the desire for it appears again . Then this palpitation of the heart will soon cease —— and the headache , the chills , the giddiness —— and this frightful indigestion . FrA ¤ ulein Elfriede , Baroness von Witzleben , ate a whole roast chicken with new potatoes for her breakfast eight days after her convalescence .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRAU BERGMANN</speaker>
      <p>May I offer you a glass of wine , Doctor ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>DR . VON BRAUSEPULVER</speaker>
      <p>I thank you , dear Frau Bergmann , my carriage is waiting .—— Do not take it so to heart . In a few weeks our dear little patient will be again as fresh and bright as a gazelle . Be of good cheer .—— Good-day , Frau Bergmann , good-day , dear child , good-day , ladies —— good-day .</p>
     </sp>
     <stage>Frau Bergmann accompanies him to the door .</stage>

      <speaker>INA</speaker>
      <p><stage>At the window .</stage>Now your plantains are in bloom again .—— Can you see that from your bed ?—— A short display , hardly worth rejoicing over them , they come and go so quickly . I , too , must go right away now . MA1 / 4ller is waiting for me in front of the post-office , and I must go first to the dressmaker 's . Mucki is to have his first trousers and Karl is to have new knit leggings for winter .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>Sometimes I feel so happy —— all joy and sunshine . I had not guessed that it could go so well in one 's heart ! I want to go out , to go over the meadows in the twilight , to look for primroses along the river and to sit down on the banks and dream — Then comes the toothache , and I feel as if I had to die the next morning at daybreak ; I grow hot and cold , it becomes dark before my eyes ; and then the beast flutters inside .—— As often as I wake up , I see Mother crying . Oh , that hurts me so .—— I can n't tell you how much , Ina !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>INA</speaker>
      <p>Shall I lift your pillows higher ?</p>

      <speaker>FRAU BERGMANN</speaker>
      <p><stage>Returning .</stage>He thinks the vomiting will soon cease ; and then you can get up in peace —— I , too , think it would be better if you got up soon , Wendla .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>INA</speaker>
      <p>Possibly when I visit you the next time you will be dancing around the house again . Good-bye , Mother . I must positively go to the dressmaker 's . God guard you , Wendla dear .<stage>Kisses her .</stage>A speedy , speedy recovery !<stage>Exit Ina .</stage></p>

      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>What did he tell you , Mother , when he was outside ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRAU BERGMANN</speaker>
      <p>He did n't say anything .—— He said FraA1 / 4lein von Witzleben was subject to fainting spells also . It is almost always so with chlorosis .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>Did he say that I have chlorosis , Mother ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRAU BERGMANN</speaker>
      <p>You are to drink milk and eat meat and vegetables when your appetite comes back .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>O , Mother , Mother , I believe I have n't chlorosis ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRAU BERGMANN</speaker>
      <p>You have chlorosis , child . Be calm , Wendla , be calm , you have chlorosis .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>No , Mother , no ! I know it . I feel it . I have n't chlorosis . I have dropsy ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRAU BERGMANN</speaker>
      <p>You have chlorosis . He said positively that you have chlorosis . Calm yourself , girl . You will get better .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <lg>
       <l>I wo n't get better . I have the dropsy , I must die , Mother .—— O ,</l>
       <l>Mother , I must die !</l>
      </lg>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRAU BERGMANN</speaker>
      <p>You must not die , child ! You must not die — Great heavens , you must not die !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>But why do you weep so frightfully , then ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRAU BERGMANN</speaker>
      <p>You must not die , child ! You have n't the dropsy , you have a child , girl ! You have a child !—— Oh , why did you do that to me !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>I have n't done anything to you .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRAU BERGMANN</speaker>
      <p>Oh do n't deny it any more , Wendla !—— I know everything . See , I did n't want to say a word to you .—— Wendla , my Wendla ——!</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>But it 's not possible , Mother . I 'm not married yet !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRAU BERGMANN</speaker>
      <p>Great Almighty God —— that 's just it , that you are not married ! That is the most frightful thing of all !—— Wendla , Wendla , Wendla , what have you done ! !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>God knows , I do n't know any more ! We lay in the hay —— I have loved nobody in the world as I do you , Mother .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRAU BERGMANN</speaker>
      <p>My sweetheart ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>O Mother , why did n't you tell me everything !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRAU BERGMANN</speaker>
      <p>Child , child , let us not make each other 's hearts any heavier ! Take hold of yourself ! Do n't make me desperate , child . To tell that to a fourteen-year-old girl ! See , I expected that about as much as I did the sun going out . I have n't acted any differently towards you than my dear , good mother did toward me .—— Oh , let us trust in the dear God , Wendla ; let us hope for compassion , and have compassion toward ourselves ! See , nothing has happened yet , child . And if we are not cowardly now , God wo n't forsake us .—— Be cheerful , Wendla , be cheerful !—— One sits so at the window with one 's hands in one 's lap , while everything changes to good , and then one realizes that one almost wanted to break one 's heart —— Wa —— why are you shivering ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>Somebody knocked .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRAU BERGMANN</speaker>
      <p>I did n't hear anything , dear heart .<stage>Goes and opens the door .</stage></p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>WENDLA</speaker>
      <p>But I heard it very plainly —— Who is outside ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>FRAU BERGMANN</speaker>
      <p>Nobody —— Schmidt 's Mother from Garden street .—— You come just at the right time , Mother Schmidt .</p>

      <stage>Men and women wine-dressers in the vineyard . The sun is setting behind the peaks of the mountains in the west . A clear sound of bells rises from the valley below . Hans Rilow and Ernest RA ¶ bel roll about in the dry grass of the highest plot under the overhanging rocks .</stage>

      <p>One sees them hanging and can n't manage any more —— and to-morrow they are in the wine press .</p>

      <p>My elasticity has its limit .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HANS</speaker>
      <p>If I bend down the vine , we can sway it from mouth to mouth . Neither of us will have to disturb himself . We can bite off the grapes and let the branches fly back to the trunk .</p>

      <p>One hardly decides upon a thing , when , see , that vanishing power begins to darken .</p>

      <speaker>HANS</speaker>
      <p>Hence the flaming firmament —— and the evening bells —— I promise myself little more for the future .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERNEST</speaker>
      <p>Sometimes I see myself already as a worthy pastor — with a good-natured little wife , a well-filled library and offices and dignities all about me . For six days one has to think , and on the seventh one opens one 's mouth . When out walking , one gives one 's hand to the school-girls and boys , and when one comes home the coffee steams , the cookies are brought out and the maids fetch apples through the garden door .—— Can you imagine anything more beautiful ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HANS</speaker>
      <p>I imagine half-closed eyelids , half-open lips and Turkish draperies .—— I do not believe in pathos . Our elders show us long faces in order to hide their stupidity . Among themselves they call each other donkeys just as we do . I know that .—— When I am a millionaire I 'll erect a monument to God .—— Imagine the future as a milkshake with sugar and cinnamon . One fellow upsets it and howls , another stirs it all together and sweats . Why not skim off the cream ?—— Or do n't you believe that one can learn how ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>ERNEST</speaker>
      <p>Let us skim !</p>

     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HANS</speaker>
      <p>Thirty years from now , on some evening like to-day , if we recall this one , perhaps it will seem too beautiful for expression .</p>

      <speaker>ERNEST</speaker>
      <p>It fits us loosely as yet .—— I should not have been content if I had not met you .—— I love you , Hans , as I have never loved a soul ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>HANS</speaker>
      <p>Let us not be sad .—— If we recall this in thirty years , perhaps we shall make fun of it .—— And yet everything is so beautiful . The mountains glow ; the grapes hang before our mouths and the evening breeze caresses the rocks like a playful flatterer .——</p>

      <p><stage>Springing down inside .</stage>The pack wo n't follow me here .—— While they are searching the brothels I can get my breath and discover how much I have accomplished . Coat in tatters , pockets empty —— I 'm not safe from the most harmless .—— I must try to get deeper into the wood to-morrow . I have trampled down a cross —— Even to-day the flowers are frozen !—— The earth is cold all around —— In the domain of the dead !—— To climb out of the hole in the roof was not as hard as this road !—— It was only there that I kept my presence of mind —— I hung over the abyss —— everything was lost in it , vanished —— Oh , if I could have stayed there . Why she , on my account !—— Why not the guilty !—— Inscrutable providence !—— I would have broken stones and gone hungry !—— What is to keep me straight now ?—— Offense follows offense . I am swallowed up in the morass . I have n't strength left to get out of it —— I was not bad !—— I was not bad !—— I was not bad !—— No mortal ever wandered so dejectedly over graves before .—— Pah !—— I wo n't lose courage ! Oh , if I should go crazy —— during this very night ! I must seek there among the latest ones !—— The wind pipes on every stone in a different key —— an anguishing symphony !—— The decayed wreaths rip apart and swing with their long threads in bits about the marble crosses —— A wood of scarecrows !—— Scarecrows on every grave , each more gruesome than the other —— as high as houses , from which the devil runs away .—— The golden letters sparkle so coldly —— The weeping willows groan and move their giant fingers over the inscriptions —— A praying angel —— a tablet . The clouds throw their shadows over it .—— How the wind hurries and howls !—— Like the march of an army it drives in from the east .—— Not a star in the heavens —— Evergreen in the garden plot ?—— Evergreen ?—— A maiden —— HERE RESTS IN GOD * Wendla Bergmann , born May 5 , 1878 , died from Cholorosis , October 27 , 1892 . * * Blessed are the Pure of Heart * And I am her murderer . I am her murderer !—— Despair is left me —— I dare not weep here . Away from here !—— Away ——</p>

       <l>A moment , Melchior ! The opportunity will not occur so readily again .</l>

      <p>Where do you come from ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>From over there —— over by the wall . You knocked down my cross . I lie by the wall .—— Give me your hand , Melchior .——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>You are not Moritz Stiefel !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>Give me your hand . I am convinced you will thank me . It wo n't be so easy again ! This is an unusually fortunate encounter .—— I came out especially ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>Do n't you sleep ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>Not what you call sleep .—— We sit on the church-tower , on the high gables of the roof —— wherever we please .——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>Restless ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>Half happy .—— We wander among the Mayflowers , among the lonely paths in the woods . We hover over gatherings of people , over the scene of accidents , gardens , festivals .—— We cower in the chimneys of dwelling-places and behind the bed curtains .—— Give me your hand .—— We do n't associate with each other , but we see and hear everything that is going on in the world . We know that everything is stupidity , everything that men do and contend for , and we laugh at it .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>What good does that do ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>What good does it have to do ?—— We are fit for nothing more , neither good nor evil . We stand high , high above earthly beings — each for himself alone . We do not associate with each other , because it would bore us . Not one of us cares for anything which he might lose . We are indifferent both to sorrow and to joy . We are satisfied with ourselves and that is all . We despise the living so heartily that we can hardly pity them . They amuse us with their doings , because , being alive , they are not worthy of compassion . We laugh at their tragedies — each by himself —— and make reflections upon them .—— Give me your hand ! If you give me your hand , you will fall down with laughter over the sensation which made you give me your hand .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>Does n't that disgust you ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>We are too high for that . We smile !—— At my burial I was among the mourners . I had a right good time . That is sublimity , Melchior ! I howled louder than any and slunk over to the wall to hold my belly from shaking with laughter . Our unapproachable sublimity is the only viewpoint which the trash understands —— They would have laughed at me also before I swung myself off .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>I have no desire to laugh at myself .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>The living , as such , are not really worth compassion !—— I admit I should not have thought so either . And now it is incomprehensible to me how one can be so naA-ve . I see through the fraud so clearly that not a cloud remains .—— Why do you want to loiter now , Melchior ! Give me your hand ! In the turn of a head you will stand heaven high above yourself .—— Your life is a sin of omission ——</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>Can you forget ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>We can do everything . Give me your hand ! We can pity the young , who take their timidity for idealism , and the old , who break their hearts from stoical deliberation . We see the Kaiser tremble at a scurrilous ballad and the lazzaroni before the youngest policeman . We ignore the masks of comedians and see the poet in the shadow of the mask . We see happiness in beggars ’ rags and the capitalist in misery and toil . We observe lovers and see them blush before each other , foreseeing that they are deceived deceivers . We see parents bringing children into the world that they may be able to say to them : aEurooeHow happy you are to have such parents ! aEuro —— and see the children go and do likewise . We can observe the innocent girl in the qualms of her first love , and the five-groschen harlot reading Schiller .—— We see God and the devil blaming each other , and cherish the unspeakable belief that both of them are drunk —— Peace and joy , Melchior ! You only need to reach me your little finger . You may become snow-white before you have such a favorable opportunity again !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>If I gave you my hand , Moritz , it would be from self-contempt .—— I see myself outlawed . What lent me courage lies in the grave . I can no longer consider noble emotions as worthy .—— And see nothing , nothing , that can save me now from my degradation .—— To myself I am the most contemptible creature in the universe .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>What delays you ?——</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MASKED MAN</speaker>
      <p>I refuse to tell .<stage>To Moritz .</stage>Vanish !—— What business have you here !—— Why have n't you on your head ?</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>I shot myself .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MASKED MAN</speaker>
      <p>Then stay where you belong . You are done with ! Do n't annoy us here with your stink of the grave . It 's inconceivable !—— Look at your fingers ! Pfu , the devil ! They will crumble soon .</p>

      <p>Why do you gabble about sublimity , then ?—— You know that that is humbug —— sour grapes ! Why do you lie so diligently , you chimera ? If you consider it so great a favor , you may stay , as far as I am concerned . But take yourself to leeward , my dear friend —— and please keep your dead man 's hand out of the game !</p>

      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>Do n't quarrel !—— Please do n't quarrel . What good does that do ?—— Why should we sit , two living men and a corpse , together in a churchyard at two o'clock in the morning if we want to quarrel like topers ! It will be a pleasure to me to arbitrate between you . If you want to quarrel , I 'll take my head under my arm and go !</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MASKED MAN</speaker>
      <p>The phantom is not wrong . One should n't forget one 's dignity .—— By morals I understand the real product of two imaginary quantities . The imaginary quantities are aEurooeshallaEuro  and aEurooewill. aEuro  The product is called morals and leaves no doubt of its reality .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>If you had only told me that earlier ! My morals hounded me to death . For the sake of my dear parents I killed myself . aEurooeHonor thy father and mother that thy days may be long in the land. aEuro  The text made a phenomenal fool of me .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MASKED MAN</speaker>
      <p>Give yourself up to no more illusions , dear friend . Your dear parents would have died as little from it as you did . Judged righteously , they would only have raged and stormed from the healthiest necessity .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>That may be right as far as it goes .—— I can assure you , however , sir , that if I reach Moritz my hand , sooner or later my morals alone will have to bear the blame .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MASKED MAN</speaker>
      <p>That is just the reason you are not Moritz !</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>But I do n't believe the difference is so material , so compulsive at least , esteemed unknown , but what by chance the same thing might have happened to you as happened to me that time when I trotted through the alder grove with a pistol in my pocket .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MASKED MAN</speaker>
      <p>Do n't you remember me ? You have been standing for the moment actually between life and death .—— Moreover , in my opinion , this is not exactly the place in which to continue such a profound debate .</p>
     </sp>
     <sp>
      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>Certainly , it 's growing cold , gentlemen ! They dressed me in my Sunday suit , but I wear neither undershirt nor drawers .</p>

      <p>Farewell , dear Moritz . I do n't know where the man is taking me . But he is a man ——</p>

      <speaker>MORITZ</speaker>
      <p>Do n't blame me for seeking to kill you , Melchior . It was old attachment . All my life I shall only be able to complain and lament that I cannot accompany you once more .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>THE MASKED MAN</speaker>
      <p>At the end everyone has his part —— You the consoling consciousness of having nothing —— you an enervating doubt of everything .— Farewell .</p>

     <sp>
      <speaker>MELCHIOR</speaker>
      <p>Farewell , Moritz . Take my heartfelt thanks for appearing before me again . How many former bright days have we lived together during the fourteen years ! I promise you , Moritz , come what may , whether during the coming years I become ten times another , whether I prosper or fail , I shall never forget you ——</p>

      <p>—— and when at last I am an old man with gray hair , then , perhaps , you will again stand closer to me than all those living about me .</p>

      <p>I thank you . Good luck to your journey , gentlemen . Do not delay any longer .</p>

      <p><stage>Alone .</stage>Now I sit here with my head under my arm .—— The moon covers her face , unveils herself again and seems not a hair the cleverer .—— I will go back to my place , right my cross , which that madcap trampled down so inconsiderately , and when everything is in order I will lie down on my back again , warm myself in the corruption and smile . FROM A LENGTHY ESSAY IN aEurooeTHE FRANKFURTER ZEITUNG. aEuro  Wedekind 's dramas are reminiscent of the pre-Shakespearian stage . But often enough one may recall Shakespeare himself .—— But we do not wish to fall into the error of that unstable enthusiasm which always makes comparison with the very greatest when only something remarkable is in question . The aim of these lines is not to hail Wedekind as the Messiah of the drama , nor as the John of a coming Messiah . For all I care , he might be the devil himself . Only one thing is certain : he is a power without his like among us , and where such a power has worked once it produces after results . Power releases power . With this drink in their bodies the public will not long continue to support either lyrical lemonade on the stage nor the dregs of dramatic penury . This poet , this artist is at the same time a knower of life . One cannot be mistaken ! This is no joke . Behind all this swarm of jumping , dancing , tumbling , contending , inflamed , agitated discourse ; behind all this pushing , roaring , foaming , gargling , flood of action , stands intuition of the world , stands the sense of life , as made manifest in the thoughts of Wedekind . It is no tearer , no eradicator , no falterer , who in this frightfully beautiful bustle of passion and inevitableness has given a picture of his own dissoluteness . He is a poet-animal trainer , who knows and rules his beasts . A man — if you please . LIST IN BELLES-LETTRES Published by BROWN BROTHERS LAFAYETTE BUILDING , PHILADELPHIA</p>

The masochism at the basis of the love of ThA<stage>C</stage>rA " se and Colombel , resulting in the murder , is depicted with wonderful art and yet without any coarseness . The author does not moralize , but with relentless pen delineates that madness of ThA<stage>C</stage>rA " se sown in her soul from birth — a madness which her convent training rather enhances than abrogates .

      <p><stage>COUNTESS JULIA</stage>A Naturalistic Tragedy , by August Strindberg . Cloth , $ 1. 00 net ; by mail , $ 1. 08 . Says Mr. James Huneker ; It is an emotional bombshell . The social world seems topsy-turvied after a first reading . After a second , while the gripping power does not relax , one realizes the writers deep , almost abysmal knowledge of human nature .... Passion there is , and a horrible atmosphere of reality . Everything is brought about naturally , inevitably . Be it understood , Strindberg is never pornographic , nor does he show a naked soul merely to afford a charming diversion , which is the practice of some French dramatists . That kitchen — fancy a kitchen as a battlefield of souls !— with its good-hearted and pious cook , the impudent scoundrel of a valet eager for revenge on his superiors , and the hallucinated girl from above stairs — it is a tiny epic of hatred , of class against mass .</p>
